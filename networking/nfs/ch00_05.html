<h2 class="sect1">0.5. Differences between the first edition and second edition</h2>

The first edition was based on SunOS 4.1, whereas this edition is
based on Solaris 8. The second edition covers much more material,
mostly due to the enhancements made to NFS, including a new version
of NFS (Version 3), a new transport protocol for NFS (TCP/IP), new
security options (IPsec and Kerberos V5), and also more tools to
analyze your systems and network.
</p>

The second edition also drops or sharply reduces the following
material from the first edition (all chapter numbers and titles are
from the first edition):
</p>

<ul><li>
Chapter 4.  Systems and networks are now bigger, faster, and more complicated. We
believe the target reader will be more interested in administering
NIS and NFS, rather than writing applications based on NIS.
</p>
</li><li>
Chapter 9.  At the time the second edition was written, most
people were accessing their electronic mail boxes using the POP or
IMAP protocols. A chapter focused on using NFS to access mail would
appeal but to a small minority.
</p>
</li><li>
Chapter 14.  This chapter survives in the
second edition, but it is much smaller. This is because there are
more competing PC/NFS products available than before, and also
because many people who want to share files between PCs and Unix
servers run the open source <em class="emphasis">Samba</em> package on
their Unix servers. Still, there are some edge conditions that
justify PC/NFS, so we discuss those, as well as general PC/NFS
issues.
</p>
</li><li>
Appendix A.  When this
appendix was written, local area networks were much less reliable
than they are today. The shift to better and standard technology,
even low technology like Category 5 connector cables, has made a big
difference. Thus, given the focus on software administration,
there's not much practical use for presenting such material in
this edition.
</p>
</li><li>
Appendix D.  The NFS Benchmark
appendix in the first edition explained how to use the
<em class="emphasis">nhfsstone</em> benchmark, and was relevant in the
period of NFS history when there was no standard, industry-recognized
benchmark. Since the first edition, the Standard Performance
Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) has addressed the void with its SFS
benchmark (sometimes referred to as LADDIS). The SFS benchmark
provides a way for prospective buyers of an NFS server to compare it
to others. Unfortunately, it's not practical for the target
reader to build the complex test beds necessary to get good SFS
benchmark numbers. A better alternative is to take advantage of the
fact that SPEC lets anyone browse reported SFS results from its web
site (<a href="http://www.spec.org/">http://www.spec.org</a>).
