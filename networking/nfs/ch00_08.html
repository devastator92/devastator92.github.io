<h2 class="sect1">0.8. Acknowledgments for the second edition</h2>

Thanks to Pat Parseghian (Transmeta), Marc Staveley (Sun), and Mike
Loukides (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.) for their input to
the outline of the second edition.
</p>

All the authors thank John Corbin, Evan Layton, Lin Ling, Dan
McDonald, Shantanu Mehendale, Anay S. Panvalkar, Mohan Parthasarathy,
Peter Staubach, and Marc Staveley (all of Sun); Carl Beame and Fred
Whiteside (both of Hummingbird); Jeanette Arnhart; and Katherine A.
Olsen, all for reviewing specific chapters and correcting many of our
mistakes.
</p>

After we thought we were done writing, it fell to Brent Callaghan,
David Robinson, and Spencer Shepler of Sun to apply their formidable
expertise in NFS and NIS to make numerous corrections to the
manuscript and many valuable suggestions on organization and content.
Thank you gentlemen, and we hope you recognize that we have taken
your input to heart.
</p>

Thanks to our editor, Mike Loukides, for giving us quick feedback on
our chapters, as well as riding herd when we weren't on
schedule.

<h3 class="sect2">0.8.1. Hal Stern's acknowledgments</h3>

More than a decade has gone by since the first edition of this book,
during which I've moved three times and started a family. It
was pretty clear to me that the state of networking in general, and
NFS and NIS in particular, was moving much faster than I was, and the
only way this second edition became possible was to hand over the
reins. Mike Eisler and Ricardo Labiaga have done a superb job of
bridging the technical eon since the first edition, and I thank them
deeply for their patience and volumes of high-quality work. I also
owe Mike Loukides the same kudos for his ability to guide this book
into its current form. Finally, a huge hug, with ten years of
interest, to my wife, Toby, who has been reminding me (at least
weekly) that I left all mention of her out of the first edition. None
of this would have been possible without her encouragement and
support.
</p>

<a name="nfs2-PREF-SECT-8.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">0.8.2. Mike Eisler's acknowledgments</h3>

First and foremost, I'm grateful for the opportunity Hal and
Mike L. gave me to contribute to this edition.
</p>

I give thanks to my wife, Ruth, daughter, Kristin, and son, Kevin,
for giving their husband and father the encouragement and space
needed to complete this book.
</p>

I started on the second edition while working for Sun. Special thanks
to my manager at the time, Cindy Vinores, for encouraging me to take
on the responsibility for co-authoring this book. Thanks also to my
successive managers at Sun, Karen Spackman, David Brittle, and Cindy
again, and to Emily Watts, my manager at Zambeel, Inc., for giving me
the equipment, software, and most of all, time to write.
</p>

Ricardo Labiaga readily agreed to sign on to help write this book
when several members of the second edition writing team had to back
out, and thus took a big load off my shoulders.
</p>

This book was written using Adobe's Framemaker document editor.
During the year 2000, Adobe made available to the world a free beta
that ran on Linux. I thank Adobe for doing so, as it allowed me to
make lots of progress while traveling on airliners.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">0.8.3. Ricardo Labiaga's acknowledgments</h3>

Hal, Mike E., and Mike L., I have truly enjoyed working with you on
this edition. Thank you; it's been an honor and a great
experience.
</p>

I did most of the work on the second edition while working for the
Solaris File Sharing Group at Sun Microsystems, Inc. I thank my
manager at the time, Bev Crair, who enthusiastically encouraged me to
sign up for the project and provided the resources to coauthor this
edition. I also thank my successive managers at Sun, David Brittle
and Penny Solin, for providing the necessary resources to complete
the endeavor.
</p>

Words are not enough to thank my friends and colleagues at Sun and
elsewhere, who answered many questions and provided much insight into
the technologies. Special thanks to David Robinson for his technical
and professional guidance throughout the years, as well as his
invaluable feedback on the material presented in this book. Many
thanks to Peter Staubach and Brent Callaghan for the time spent
discussing what NFS should and should not do. Thanks to Mohan
Parthasarathy and David Comay of Solaris Internet Engineering for
answering my many questions about routing concepts. Thanks to Carl
Williams and Sebastien Roy for their explanations of the IPv6
protocol. Thanks to Jim Mauro and Richard McDougall for providing the
original Solaris priority paging information presented in 
<a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "Network Performance Analysis"</a>.
Thanks to Jeff Mogul of Compaq for his review of the NFSWATCH
material, and Narendra Chaparala for introducing me to ethereal.
</p>

I wish to thank Dr. David H. Williams of The University of Texas at
El Paso, for providing me the opportunity to work as a system
administrator in the Unix lab, where I had my first encounter with
Unix and networking twelve years ago. I thank my parents from the
bottom of my heart, for their encouragement throughout the years, and
for their many sacrifices that made my education possible.
</p>

My deepest gratitude goes to my wife, Kara, for her encouragement,
understanding, and awesome support throughout the writing of this
book. Thank you for putting up with my late hours, work weekends, and
late dinner dates.
</p>
