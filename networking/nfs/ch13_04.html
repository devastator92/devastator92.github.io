<h2 class="sect1">13.4. NIS tools</h2>


Tools discussed to this point help to dissect the session and
transport layers under an application such as NIS. The application
and the utilities that analyze its behavior and performance all rely
on a well-behaved network. Assuming that the lower layers are in
place, NIS-oriented tools fine-tune the NIS system and help resolve
problems that are caused by information in the NIS maps, rather than
the way in which the maps are accessed. The tools described in this
section alter client-server bindings, locate NIS servers and
information for a particular map, and look up keys in maps.</p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.1. Key lookup</h3>


<em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> is a <em class="emphasis">grep</em>-like
command<a name="INDEX-2085" /> <a name="INDEX-2086" />
<a name="INDEX-2087" />
<a name="INDEX-2088" />
for NIS maps. <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> finds a single key in an
NIS map and prints the data associated with that key:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypmatch help-request aliases</b></tt> 
john.goodman
 
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypmatch onaga hosts</b></tt> 
131.40.52.27   onaga</pre></blockquote>


This procedure differs from using <em class="emphasis">grep</em> on the
ASCII source file that produced the map in two ways:</p>


<ul><li><em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> can be run from any client, while the
NIS map source files may only exist on a server with limited user
access. Therefore, users who need to parse maps such as the password,
ipnodes, or hosts files must use NIS-oriented tools to gather their
data.</p></li><li>The client may be bound to an NIS server with a corrupted map set or
one that is out-of-date with the NIS master server. In this case, the
output of <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> will not agree with the output
of <em class="emphasis">grep</em> run on the ASCII source file.</p></li></ul>
Associated with <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> is
<em class="emphasis">ypcat</em>, which is the equivalent of
<em class="emphasis">cat</em> for NIS files. It writes the entire map file
to the standard output:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypcat hosts</b></tt> 
131.40.52.121  vineyard         
131.40.52.54   hannah           
131.40.52.132  positive</pre></blockquote>


NIS maps are stored as DBM databases, indexed files with fast access
provided through a hash table. Standard utilities such as
<em class="emphasis">grep</em> do not produce meaningful results when used
on DBM data files. To peek into the contents of an NIS map, you must
use <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> or <em class="emphasis">ypcat</em>.
Output from NIS tools is colored by the underlying DBM index file
organization, and presents several avenues of confusion:</p>


<ul><li>By default, only the value paired with the key in the map is
displayed, and not the key itself. Some maps retain the key as part
of the data value because it is needed by applications that retrieve
the map entry. Library routines that locate a password file entry
based on UID, for example, return the user's login name as part
of the password file structure. Other maps such as
<em class="emphasis">aliases</em> simply store the value associated with
the key, when applications (such as mail) that reference the NIS map
already have the key value. The following excerpt from
<em class="emphasis">ypcat aliases</em> is of little value because there
are no alias names associated with the alias expansions:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypcat aliases</b></tt>
dan, lauri, paul, harry, bob
dave, michael
michael, jan, stewart, tom</pre></blockquote>

Both <em class="emphasis">ypcat</em> and <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> use
the <em class="emphasis">-k</em> option to print the data value with its
associated key:</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypcat -k aliases</b></tt>
south-sales     dan, lauri, paul, harry, bob
engin-managers  dave, michael
north-engin     michael, jan, stewart, tom</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>

<ul><li>Some maps do not associate a data value with a key. The most common
map of this variety is the <em class="emphasis">ypservers</em> map, which
simply contains hostnames of NIS servers without any additional
information. When using <em class="emphasis">ypcat</em> or
<em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> with value-less maps, blank lines are
produced as output:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypcat ypservers</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

unless the <em class="emphasis">-k</em> option is specified:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypcat -k ypservers</b></tt>
&gt;mahimahi
wahoo
thud</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>

<ul><li>An NIS server implements separate procedures to get the
"first" and each successive key in a map.
<em class="emphasis">ypcat</em> uses the "get first key" and
"get next key" procedures to locate the first key in the
DBM file and to walk through all keys. The ordering of the keys is
determined by a linear scan through the DBM index file, rather than
the order in which the records appear in the plain text file. Because
keys are encountered in the order in which they are hash chained
together, <em class="emphasis">ypcat</em> produces a seemingly random
ordering of the keys. In the hosts file example earlier, the original
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/hosts</em> file was sorted by increasing
host number in the IP addresses; but the process of hashing the keys
into the DBM file produced the ordering seen with
<em class="emphasis">ypcat</em>.</p></li></ul>


As a diagnostic tool, <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> can be used to
identify NIS maps that are out of synchronization even after a map
transfer has been requested or scheduled. It is often used to see if
a change has taken place. After a new map is built, it is generally
pushed to other servers using <em class="emphasis">yppush</em>. However,
NIS map changes may not propagate as quickly as desired. A slave
server may be down when a map transfer<a name="INDEX-2089" /> <a name="INDEX-2090" /> <a name="INDEX-2091" /> <a name="INDEX-2092" /> occurs, in which case it will not get
an updated map until the next <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> transfer.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.2. Displaying and analyzing client bindings</h3>


<em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> provides information about <a name="INDEX-2093" /> <a name="INDEX-2094" /> <a name="INDEX-2095" />
<a name="INDEX-2096" />a
client's NIS domain binding, and the availability of master
servers for various maps in the domain. With no arguments, it returns
the name of the NIS server to which the client is currently bound by
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em>:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich</b></tt> 
mahimahi</pre></blockquote>


If a hostname is passed as a parameter, then
<em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> queries the named host for its current
binding. If <em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> cannot resolve the hostname
into an IP address, it reports an error:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich gonzo</b></tt> 
ypwhich: clnt_create error: RPC: Unknown host</pre></blockquote>


An IP address may be used in place of a hostname if you are debugging
NIS problems, since NIS itself is used to map the hostname into an IP
address. If NIS operation is not reliable, then explicit IP addresses
should be used with all of the NIS-oriented debugging tools. For
example:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich 131.40.52.34</b></tt> 
wahoo</pre></blockquote>


Querying client bindings individually is useful for debugging client
problems, but it doesn't provide much useful information about
the use of NIS on the network. <em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> is better
suited for answering questions about NIS servers: Are there enough
servers? Are the clients evenly distributed among the NIS servers?
There is no client binding information kept by an NIS server  -- 
the binding is something created by the client and known only to the
client. The server simply answers requests that are sent to it. To
determine the distribution of NIS clients to servers, you must poll
the clients.</p>


<em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em>, embedded in a shell script, collects
NIS client demographics to perform a "census" of server
usage:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">#! /bin/sh 
#       ypcensus - poll for ypservers 
( for h in `ypcat hosts | awk '{print $2}'` 
  do 
        ypwhich $h 
  done ) | grep -v 'not running' | sort | uniq -c</pre></blockquote>


The <em class="emphasis">for</em> expression dumps the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> NIS file, and <em class="emphasis">awk</em>
extracts the second field  --  the hostname  --  from each
entry. The loop then queries each host for its NIS server, and then
the output from the loop is sorted. The entire loop is executed in a
subshell so that its output is treated as a single stream by the next
stage of the command pipeline. The <em class="emphasis">grep</em> command
filters out errors from <em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em>, produced when
an NIS client has not found a server for its domain. At the end of
the pipe, <em class="emphasis">uniq -c</em> counts the occurrences of each
line, producing the census of NIS servers. Sample output from the
script is:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypcensus</b></tt> 
 26 onaga 
  7 mahimahi 
  8 thud</pre></blockquote>


You may find that the total number of bindings recorded is less than
the number of clients  --  some clients may not have formed a
server binding when the script was run. Executing
<em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> causes the client to bind to a server,
so if you "miss" some hosts on the first attempt, execute
the script again after all clients have been forced to find servers.</p>


What does the output indicate? With multiple NIS servers, it is
possible for the client distribution to load one server more heavily
than the others. In the previous example, the large number of clients
bound to server <em class="emphasis">onaga</em> could be caused by several
things:</p>


<ul><li>The NIS server <em class="emphasis">onaga</em> is significantly faster
than the other NIS servers, so it always replies to
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> requests before other servers.</p></li><li>The servers have about the same CPU speed, so the lopsided binding
indicates that <em class="emphasis">onaga</em> has the lightest CPU load.
It generates replies faster than the other servers.</p></li><li><em class="emphasis">onaga</em> may be "closer" to more NIS
clients on the network, counting delays in network hardware. Network
topology favors NIS servers that are physically close to the client
if bridges or repeaters separate clients and potential NIS servers,
adding packet transmission delays that can overshadow CPU scheduling
delays on loaded servers.</p></li></ul>
The few clients bound to <em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em> and
<em class="emphasis">thud</em> may experience NIS timeouts if these NIS
servers are heavily loaded. The relatively small number of clients
bound to these servers may indicate that they aren't the best
candidates for NIS service because they have a higher CPU load.</p>


Results of the binding poll should be compared to desired goals for
balancing NIS server usage. If one NIS server is much faster than the
others, you may improve the NIS binding distribution by shifting the
fast machine's NIS service to one or two machines that are more
similar to the other NIS servers.</p>


To see if you have enough NIS servers, or if your choice of servers
provides adequate NIS service, watch for broadcasts from NIS clients
to the <em class="emphasis">yserv</em> port. You can observe network
broadcasts using a tool like <em class="emphasis">snoop</em> or
<em class="emphasis">ethereal</em>, both of which watch every packet on
the network and print those that meet a defined criteria.
<em class="emphasis">ethereal</em> and <em class="emphasis">snoop</em> are
introduced in <a href="ch13_05.html#nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-5">Section 13.5, "Network analyzers"</a>. To
find all <em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> broadcasts, use the following
<em class="emphasis">snoop</em> command line:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>snoop broadcast port sunrpc</b></tt> 
        aqua -&gt; 131.40.52.255 NIS C DOMAIN_NONACK mydomain.com
   semaphore -&gt; 131.40.52.255 NIS C DOMAIN_NONACK mydomain.com</pre></blockquote>


<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> sends its RPC broadcast to the portmapper
on the <em class="emphasis">sunrpc</em> port (port 111), and the
portmapper calls the <em class="emphasis">ypserv</em> process indirectly.
If you see a large number of broadcast calls being made to the
portmapper, then your NIS clients are rebinding frequently and you
should add more NIS servers or choose servers that have <a name="INDEX-2097" /> <a name="INDEX-2098" /> <a name="INDEX-2099" /> <a name="INDEX-2100" />a lighter load.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.3. Other NIS map information</h3>


In addition to providing NIS server <a name="INDEX-2101" /> <a name="INDEX-2102" /> <a name="INDEX-2103" />binding information,
<em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> examines the NIS map information: the
master server for a map, the list of all maps, and map nickname
translations. Map nicknames are more mnemonic forms of map names used
in place of the actual DBM filenames in NIS-related utilities; the
nickname usually has the <em class="emphasis">.byaddr</em> or
<em class="emphasis">.byname</em> suffix removed. Nicknames exist only
within the <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em>, <em class="emphasis">ypcat</em>,
and <em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> utilities; they are not part of the
maps and are not part of the NIS servers. No application will ever
perform a key lookup in map <em class="emphasis">passwd</em>; it has to
use <em class="emphasis">passwd.byname</em> or
<em class="emphasis">passwd.byuid</em>.</p>


<em class="emphasis">ypwhich -x</em> prints the table of nicknames:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich -x</b></tt> 
Use "passwd"           for map "passwd.byname"
Use "group"            for map "group.byname"
Use "networks"         for map "networks.byaddr"
Use "hosts"            for map "hosts.byname"
Use "protocols"        for map "protocols.bynumber"
Use "services"         for map "services.byname"
Use "aliases"          for map "mail.aliases"
Use "ethers"           for map "ethers.byname"
Use "ipnodes"          for map "ipnodes.byname"
Use "project"          for map "project.byname"</pre></blockquote>


While map nicknames provide a shorter command-line option for tools
that take a map name as a parameter, they can also create name
conflicts with non-standard maps that share commonly used map names.
For example, a daemon that maps popular internal resource server
names to IP ports might create an NIS map called
<em class="emphasis">services</em> advertising its default mappings. This
map name will not conflict with the NIS map created from
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/services</em> because the latter is
converted into the map <em class="emphasis">services.byname</em>. Users of
<em class="emphasis">ypcat</em> and <em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> may be
surprised by output that appears to confuse the map names.</p>


The following example doesn't work at first because the
<em class="emphasis">ypmatch</em> utility turns the map name
<em class="emphasis">services</em> into
<em class="emphasis">services.byname</em>, using the standard nickname
translation. NIS completely ignores the map you want. If you use
<em class="emphasis">ypmatch -t</em>, nickname translation is suppressed
and you locate the desired map:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypmatch cullinet services</b></tt> 
Can't match key cullinet in map services.byname.  Reason: no such key in map. 
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypmatch -t cullinet services</b></tt> 
cullinet        6667</pre></blockquote>


If you create your own maps, it's best to pick names that do
not conflict with the standard map nicknames. Finally,
<em class="emphasis">ypwhich</em> finds the master server for a map, or
prints the list of all known maps if passed the
<em class="emphasis">-m</em> option:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich -m passwd</b></tt> 
mahimahi 
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich -m</b></tt> 
<i class="lineannotation">excerpt follows </i>

<em class="emphasis">ypwhich -m</em> examines the NIS master server name
embedded in the NIS map DBM file.</p>


You can also explode an NIS map using <em class="emphasis">makedbm
-u</em>, which "undoes" a DBM file. You see the
data records as well as the two additional records added by DBM
containing the NIS master name and the map's timestamp. If you
have concerns about data disappearing from NIS maps, dump the entire
map (including keys) using <em class="emphasis">makedbm -u</em>:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">[wahoo]% <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp/nesales</b></tt>

The map master information is useful if you have changed NIS master
servers and need to verify that client maps are built correctly
and<a name="INDEX-2104" />
<a name="INDEX-2105" />
<a name="INDEX-2106" />
synchronized with the new master server.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.4. Setting initial client bindings</h3>


The <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> command is used to <a name="INDEX-2107" /> <a name="INDEX-2108" />
<a name="INDEX-2109" />preconfigure a list of NIS servers to
contact at startup time. <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> stores the list
of NIS servers in the file
<em class="emphasis">/var/yp/binding/domainname/ypservers</em>, where
<em class="emphasis">domainname</em> resolves to your NIS domain name.
Normally, <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> is run only once after
installing the system, though it may also be run whenever a new NIS
server is added to the network or an existing one is decommissioned:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>ypinit -c</b></tt>

In order for NIS to operate sucessfully, we have to construct a list of the 
NIS servers.  Please continue to add the names for YP servers in order of
preference, one per line.  When you are done with the list, type a &lt;control D&gt;
or a return on a line by itself.
	next host to add:  <tt class="userinput"><b>onaga</b></tt>
	next host to add:  <tt class="userinput"><b>mahimahi</b></tt>
	next host to add:  <tt class="userinput"><b>131.40.52.126</b></tt>
	next host to add:  <tt class="userinput"><b>^D</b></tt>
The current list of yp servers looks like this:

onaga
mahimahi
131.40.52.126

Is this correct?  [y/n: y]  <tt class="userinput"><b>y</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


Make sure to include the necessary hostname to IP address mappings in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/ipnodes</em> or
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/hosts</em> before running the
<em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> command, otherwise
<em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> will fail. The resulting
<em class="emphasis">ypservers</em> file:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>cat ypservers</b></tt>
onaga
mahimahi
131.40.52.126</pre></blockquote>


Note that it is not necessary to preconfigure an initial list of NIS
servers, since <em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> will broadcast a request
on the network to find the available servers if the initial list does
not exist. <em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> is started by
<em class="emphasis">/usr/lib/netsvc/yp/ypstart</em> which in turn is
invoked by the <em class="emphasis">/etc/init.d/rpc</em> startup script:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">Excerpt from /usr/lib/netsvc/yp/ypstart:</i>
if [ -d /var/yp/binding/$domain -a -f /var/yp/binding/$domain/ypservers ]; then

        /usr/lib/netsvc/yp/ypbind -broadcast &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
        echo " ypbind\c"
fi</pre></blockquote>


The next section will explain in more detail when and why you may
want to bind to specific NIS servers, and how you can modify the
binding once <em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> has been started.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-4.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.5. Modifying client bindings </h3>


The <em class="emphasis">ypset</em> utility forcefully changes the server
binding. It is mostly used to dissect tangles of intertwined NIS
servers and to point a client at a server that is not hearing its
broadcasts. The normal NIS server search is conducted by
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> through a broadcast request. The first
server answering the request is bound to the domain, and is probably
the most lightly loaded or closest server to the requesting host. As
shown in the previous <em class="emphasis">rpcinfo</em> examples, a
server's response time, relative to other NIS servers, varies
over time as its load fluctuates.</p>


If the server's load increases so that NIS requests are not
serviced before the RPC call times out on the client machine, then
the client's <em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> daemon dissolves the
current binding and rebroadcasts a request for NIS service. With
varying server loads and local network traffic conditions, the
timeout/rebroadcast system effects a dynamic load balancing scheme
between NIS clients and servers.</p>


Neither <em class="emphasis">ypset</em> nor <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em>
should be used to implement a static load balancing scheme for two
reasons:</p>


<ul><li>The initial <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> or <em class="emphasis">ypset</em>
may implement your chosen server allocation, but poor response time
from this server causes the client to break the binding and perform a
broadcast-based search. This dynamic rebinding will undo the attempts
to effect a preferred binding.</p></li><li>Extreme disparity in NIS server usage is indicative of other network
problems or of excessive server loading imposed by NFS service,
interactive use, or print spooling.</p></li></ul>
There are four valid uses of <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> and
<em class="emphasis">ypset</em>:</p>


<ul><li>Point a client at an NIS server that is isolated from it by a router
or gateway that does not forward broadcast packets.</p></li><li>Test the services provided by a particular server, if you have
recently installed or rebuilt the maps on that server.</p></li><li>Force servers to rebind to themselves instead of cross-binding.</p></li><li>Point a client to use a known and trusted server for security
reasons, instead of using any NIS server on the network.</p></li></ul>
Again, <em class="emphasis">ypinit</em> is used to set the initial static
binding at boot time, <em class="emphasis">ypset</em> is used to change
this binding after boot time. It is recommended to use an IP address
as the argument to <em class="emphasis">ypset</em> to avoid using the very
same NIS service that <em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> is having trouble
starting.</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>ypset 131.40.52.28</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>ypwhich</b></tt> 
mahimahi</pre></blockquote>


Alternatively, you can verify that the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/ipnodes</em> or
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/hosts</em> file lists the IP address for
the new NIS server, and that <em class="emphasis">/etc/nsswitch.conf</em>
is configured to use <em class="emphasis">files</em> before it uses NIS.</p>


In some NIS implementations (Solaris and others),
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> no longer allows
<em class="emphasis">ypset</em> to change its binding unless this
functionality is explicitly enabled. If the
<em class="emphasis">-ypset</em> option is used when
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> is started, then
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> accepts requests from any remote machine
to rebind to a specified server:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">ypbind -ypset</pre></blockquote>


The use of <em class="emphasis">-ypset</em> is a security risk as it
allows a third party to change the binding to a potentially hostile
server. Without the <em class="emphasis">-ypset</em> parameter, attempts
to change the server binding will fail:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">wahoo# <tt class="userinput"><b>ypset thud</b></tt> 
ypset: Sorry, ypbind on host localhost has rejected your request.</pre></blockquote>


A more restrictive form is:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">ypbind -ypsetme</pre></blockquote>


which only allows root on the local machine to invoke
<em class="emphasis">ypset</em> to alter the binding. To discourage
