<h2 class="sect1">4.2. Managing map files</h2>


Keeping map files updated on all servers<a name="INDEX-638" /> <a name="INDEX-639" /> is essential to the proper operation of
NIS. There are two mechanisms for updating <a name="INDEX-640" />
<a name="INDEX-641" />
<a name="INDEX-642" />map files: using
<em class="emphasis">make</em> and the NIS <em class="emphasis">Makefile</em>,
which pushes maps from the master server to the slave servers, and
the <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> utility, which pulls maps from the
master server. This section starts with a look at how map file
updates are made and how they get distributed to slave servers.</p>


Having a single point of administration makes it easier to propagate
configuration changes through the network, but it also means that you
may have more than one person changing the same file. If there are
several system administrators maintaining the NIS maps, they need to
coordinate their efforts, or you will find that one person removes
NIS map entries added by another. Using a source code control system,
such as SCCS or RCS, in conjunction with NIS often solves this
problem. In the second part of this section, we'll see how to
use alternate map source files and source code control systems with
NIS.</p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.1. Map distribution</h3>


Master and slave servers are<a name="INDEX-643" />
<a name="INDEX-644" /> distinguished by their ability to effect
permanent changes to NIS maps. Changes may be made to an NIS map on a
slave server, but the next map transfer from the master will overlay
this change. Modify maps <em class="emphasis">only</em> on the master
server, and push them from the master server to its slave servers. On
the NIS master server, edit the source file for the map using your
favorite text editor. Source files for NIS maps are listed in <a href="ch03_02.html#nfs2-CHP-3-TABLE-1">Table 3-1</a>. Then go to the NIS map directory <a name="INDEX-645" /> <a name="INDEX-646" />and build the
new map using <em class="emphasis">make</em>, as shown here:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>vi /etc/hosts</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>make</b></tt> 
<i class="lineannotation">...New hosts map is built and distributed...</i></pre></blockquote>


Without any arguments, <em class="emphasis">make</em> builds all
maps<a name="INDEX-647" />
<a name="INDEX-648" /> that are
out-of-date with respect to their ASCII source files. When more than
one map is built from the same ASCII file, for example the
<em class="emphasis">passwd.byname</em> and
<em class="emphasis">passwd.byuid</em> maps built from
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>, they are all built when
<em class="emphasis">make</em> is invoked.</p>


When a map is rebuilt, the <em class="emphasis">yppush</em> utility is
used
<a name="INDEX-649" />
<a name="INDEX-650" />
<a name="INDEX-651" />to
check the order number of the same map on each NIS server. If the
maps are out-of-date, <em class="emphasis">yppush</em> transfers the map
to the slave servers, using the server names in the
<em class="emphasis">ypservers</em> map. Scripts to rebuild maps and push
them to slave servers are part of the NIS
<em class="emphasis">Makefile</em>, which is covered in <a href="ch04_02.html#nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-2.3">Section 4.2.3, "Map file dependencies"</a>.</p>


Map transfers done on demand after<a name="INDEX-652" /> source file modifications may not always
complete successfully. The NIS slave server may be down, or the
transfer may timeout due to severe congestion or server host loading.
To ensure that maps do not remain out-of-date for a long time (until
the next NIS map update), NIS uses the <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em>
utility to transfer a map to a slave server. The slave transfers the
map after checking the timestamp on its copy; if the master's
copy has been modified more recently, the slave server will replace
its copy of the map with the one it transfers from the server. It is
possible to force a map transfer to a slave server, ignoring the
slave's timestamp, which is useful if a map gets corrupted and
must be replaced. Under Solaris, an additional master server daemon
called <em class="emphasis">ypxfrd</em> is <a name="INDEX-653" />used to speed up map transfer
operations, but the map distribution utilities resort to the old
method if they cannot reach <em class="emphasis">ypxfrd</em> on the master
server.</p>


The map transfer  --  both in <em class="emphasis">yppush</em> and in
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em>  --  is performed by requesting that
the slave server walk through all keys in the modified map and build
a map containing these keys. This seems quite counterintuitive, since
you would hope that a map transfer amounts to nothing more than the
master server sending the map to the slave server. However, NIS was
designed to be used in a heterogeneous environment, so the master
server's DBM file format may not correspond to that used by the
slave server. DBM files are tightly tied to the byte ordering and
file block allocation rules of the server system, and a DBM file must
be created on the system that indexes it. Slave servers, therefore,
have to enumerate the entries in an NIS map and rebuild the map from
them, using their own local conventions for DBM file construction.
Indeed, it is theoretically possible to have NIS server
implementation that does not use DBM. When the slave server has
rebuilt the map, it replaces its existing copy of the map with the
new one. Schedules for transferring maps to slave servers and scripts
to be run out of <em class="emphasis">cron</em> are provided in the next
<a name="INDEX-654" />
<a name="INDEX-655" />section.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.2. Regular map transfers</h3>


Relying on demand-driven updates is <a name="INDEX-656" />overly optimistic, since a server
may be down when the master is updated. NIS includes the
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> tool to perform <a name="INDEX-657" /> <a name="INDEX-658" />
<a name="INDEX-659" /> <a name="INDEX-660" />periodic
transfers of maps to slave servers, keeping them synchronized with
the master server even if they miss an occasional
<em class="emphasis">yppush</em>. The <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> utility
will transfer a map only if the slave's copy is out-of-date
with respect to the master's map.</p>


Unlike <em class="emphasis">yppush</em>, <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> runs
on the slave. <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em>
contacts<a name="INDEX-661" />
<a name="INDEX-662" /> the
master server for a map, enumerates the entries in the map, and
rebuilds a private copy of the map. If the map is built successfully,
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> replaces the slave server's copy of
the map with the newly created one. Note that doing a
<em class="emphasis">yppush</em> from the NIS master essentially involves
asking each slave server to perform a <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em>
operation if the slave's copy of the map is out-of-date. The
difference between <em class="emphasis">yppush</em> and
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> (besides the servers on which they are
run) is that <em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> retrieves a map even if the
slave server does not have a copy of it, while
<em class="emphasis">yppush</em> requires that the slave server have the
map in order to check its modification time.</p>


<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> map updates should be scheduled out of
<em class="emphasis">cron</em> based on how often the maps change. The
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em> and <em class="emphasis">aliases</em> maps
change most frequently, and could be transferred once an hour. Other
maps, like the <em class="emphasis">services</em> and
<em class="emphasis">rpc</em> maps, tend to be static and can be updated
once a day. The standard mechanism for invoking
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> out of <em class="emphasis">cron</em> is to
create two or more scripts based on transfer frequency, and to call
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr</em> from the scripts. The maps included in the
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr_1perhour</em> script are those that are likely
to be modified several times during the day, while those in
<em class="emphasis">ypxfr_2perday, and ypxfr_1perday</em> may change once
every few days:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">ypxfr_1perhour script: </i>

</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.3. Map file dependencies</h3>


Dependencies of NIS <a name="INDEX-668" />
<a name="INDEX-669" />
<a name="INDEX-670" />maps on ASCII source files are maintained
by the NIS <em class="emphasis">Makefile</em>, located in the NIS
directory <em class="emphasis">/var/yp</em> on the master server. The
<em class="emphasis">Makefile</em>
<a name="INDEX-671" />dependencies
are built around timestamp files named after their respective source
files. For example, the timestamp file for the NIS maps built from
the password file is <em class="emphasis">passwd.time</em>, and the
timestamp for the hosts maps is kept in
<em class="emphasis">hosts.time</em>.</p>


The timestamp files are
empty<a name="INDEX-672" />
<a name="INDEX-673" /> because only their modification dates
are of interest. The <em class="emphasis">make</em> utility is used to
build maps according to the rules in the
<em class="emphasis">Makefile</em>, and <em class="emphasis">make</em> compares
file modification times to determine which targets need to be
rebuilt. For example, <em class="emphasis">make</em> compares the
timestamp on the <em class="emphasis">passwd.time</em> file and that of
the ASCII <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> file, and rebuilds the NIS
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em> map if the ASCII source file was modified
since the last time the NIS <em class="emphasis">passwd</em> map was
built.</p>


After editing a map source file, building the map (and any other maps
that may depend on it) is done with <em class="emphasis">make</em>:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>make passwd    </b></tt><i class="lineannotation">Rebuilds only password map. </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>make           </b></tt><i class="lineannotation">Rebuilds all maps that are out-of-date.</i></pre></blockquote>


If the source file has been modified more recently than the timestamp
file, <em class="emphasis">make</em> notes that the dependency in the
<em class="emphasis">Makefile</em> is not met and executes the commands to
regenerate the NIS map. In most cases, map regeneration requires that
the ASCII file be stripped of comments, fed to
<em class="emphasis">makedbm</em> for conversion to DBM format, and then
pushed to all slave servers using <em class="emphasis">yppush</em>.</p>


Be careful when building a few selected maps; if other maps depend on
the modified map, then you may distribute incomplete map information.
For example, Solaris uses the <em class="emphasis">netid</em> map to
combine password and group information. The
<em class="emphasis">netid</em> map is used by login shells to determine
user credentials: for every user, it lists all of the groups that
user is a member of. The <em class="emphasis">netid</em> map depends on
both the <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/group</em> files, so when either one is changed,
the <em class="emphasis">netid</em> map should be rebuilt.</p>


But let's say you make a change to the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/groups</em> file, and decide to just rebuild and
distribute the <em class="emphasis">group</em> map:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>make group</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


The commands in this example do not update the
<em class="emphasis">netid</em> map, because the
<em class="emphasis">netid</em> map doesn't depend on the
<em class="emphasis">group</em> map at all. The <em class="emphasis">netid</em>
map depends on the <em class="emphasis">/etc/group</em> file  --  as
does the <em class="emphasis">group</em> map  --  but in the previous
example, you would have instructed <em class="emphasis">make</em> to build
only the <em class="emphasis">group</em> map. If you build the
<em class="emphasis">group</em> map without updating the
<em class="emphasis">netid</em> map, users will become very confused about
their group memberships: their login shells will read
<em class="emphasis">netid</em> and get old group information, even though
the NIS map source files <em class="emphasis">appear</em> correct.</p>


The best solution to this problem is to build all maps that are
out-of-date by using <em class="emphasis">make</em> with no arguments:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>make</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


Once the map is built, the NIS <em class="emphasis">Makefile</em>
distributes it, using <em class="emphasis">yppush</em>, to the slave
servers named in the <em class="emphasis">ypservers</em> map.
<em class="emphasis">yppush</em> walks through the list of NIS servers and
performs an RPC call to each slave server to check the timestamp on
the map to be transferred. If the map is out-of-date,
<em class="emphasis">yppush</em> uses another RPC call to the slave server
to initiate a transfer of the map.</p>


A map that is corrupted or was not successfully transferred to all
slave servers can be explicitly rebuilt and repushed by removing its
timestamp file on the master server:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">master# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
master# <tt class="userinput"><b>rm hosts.time</b></tt> 
master# <tt class="userinput"><b>make hosts</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


This procedure should be used if a map was built when the NIS master
server's time was set incorrectly, creating a map that becomes
out-of-date when the time is reset. If you need to perform a complete
reconstruction of all NIS maps, for any reason, remove all of the
timestamp files and run <em class="emphasis">make</em>:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">master# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
master# <tt class="userinput"><b>rm *.time</b></tt> 
master# <tt class="userinput"><b>make</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


This extreme step is best reserved for testing the map distribution
mechanism, or recovering from corruption of the NIS map<a name="INDEX-674" /> <a name="INDEX-675" /> <a name="INDEX-676" /> directory.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.4. Password file updates</h3>


One exception to the <em class="emphasis">yppush</em> push-on-demand
<a name="INDEX-677" /> <a name="INDEX-678" /> <a name="INDEX-679" />strategy is the
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em> map. Users need to be able to change
their passwords
<a name="INDEX-680" />
<a name="INDEX-681" />without system manager intervention.
The hosts file, for example, is changed by the superuser and then
pushed to other servers when it is rebuilt. In contrast, when you
change your password, you (as a nonprivileged user) modify the local
password file. To change a password in an NIS map, the change must be
made on the master server and distributed to all slave servers in
order to be seen back on the client host where you made the change.</p>


<em class="emphasis">yppasswd</em> is a user utility
<a name="INDEX-682" />
<a name="INDEX-683" />that
is similar to the <em class="emphasis">passwd</em> program, but it changes
the user's password in the original source file on the NIS
master server. <em class="emphasis">yppasswd</em> usually forces the
password map to be rebuilt, although at sites choosing not to rebuild
the map on demand, the new password will not be distributed until the
next map transfer. <em class="emphasis">yppasswd</em> is used like
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em>, but it reports the server name on which
the modifications are made. Here is an example:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">[wahoo]% <tt class="userinput"><b>yppasswd</b></tt> 
Changing NIS password for stern on mahimahi. 
Old password: 
New password: 
Retype new password: 
NIS entry changed on mahimahi</pre></blockquote>


Some versions of <em class="emphasis">passwd</em> (such as Solaris 2.6 and
higher) check to see if the password file is managed by NIS, and
invoke <em class="emphasis">yppasswd</em> if this is the case. Check your
vendor's documentation for procedures particular to your
system.</p>


NIS provides read-only access to its maps. There
<a name="INDEX-684" />is nothing in the NIS protocol that
allows a client to rewrite the data for a key. To accept changes to
<a name="INDEX-685" />maps, a server distinct from the NIS
server is required that modifies the source file for the map and then
rebuilds the NIS map from the modified ASCII file. To handle incoming
<em class="emphasis">yppasswd</em> change<a name="INDEX-686" />
requests, the master server must run the
<em class="emphasis">yppasswdd</em> daemon (note the second
"d" in the daemon's name). This RPC daemon gets
started in the <em class="emphasis">/usr/lib/netsvc/yp/ypstart</em> boot
script on the master NIS server only:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">if [ "$master" = "$hostname" -a X$YP_SERVER = "XTRUE" ]; then
                ...
                if [ -x $YPDIR/rpc.yppasswdd ]; then
                        PWDIR=`grep "^PWDIR" /var/yp/Makefile 2&gt; /dev/null` \
                        &amp;&amp; PWDIR=`expr "$PWDIR" : `.*=[         ]*&lt;[^  ]*&gt;``
                        if [ "$PWDIR" ]; then
                                if [ "$PWDIR" = "/etc" ]; then
                                        unset PWDIR
                                else
                                        PWDIR="-D $PWDIR"
                                fi
                        fi
                        $YPDIR/rpc.yppasswdd $PWDIR -m \
                                &amp;&amp; echo ` rpc.yppasswdd\c`
                fi
                ...
        fi</pre></blockquote>


The host making a password map change locates the master server by
asking for the master of the NIS <em class="emphasis">passwd</em> map, and
the <em class="emphasis">yppasswdd</em> daemon acts
<a name="INDEX-687" />
<a name="INDEX-688" />as
a gateway between the user's host and a
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em>-like utility on the master server. The
location of the master server's password file and options to
build a new map after each update are given as command-line arguments
to <em class="emphasis">yppasswdd</em>, as shown in the previous example.</p>


The <em class="emphasis">-D</em> argument specifies the name of the master
server's source for the password map; it may be the default
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> or it may point to an alternative
password file.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> The
<em class="emphasis">-m</em> option specifies that
<em class="emphasis">make</em> is to be performed in the NIS directory on
the master server. You can optionally specify arguments after
<em class="emphasis">-m</em> that are passed to make. With a default set
up, the fragment in ypstart would cause
<em class="emphasis">yppasswdd</em> to invoke <em class="emphasis">make</em>
as:</p><blockquote class="footnote">

after each change to the master's password source file. Since
it is likely only the password file will have changed, only the

<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.5. Source code control for map files</h3>


With multiple system administrators and a <a name="INDEX-694" /> <a name="INDEX-695" />single point of administration, it is
possible for conflicting or unexplained changes to NIS maps to wreak
havoc with the network. The best way to control modifications to maps
and to track the change history of map source files is to put them
under a source code control system <a name="INDEX-696" />such
<a name="INDEX-697" />as SCCS.</p>


Source code files usually contain the SCCS headers in a comment or in
a global string that gets compiled into an executable. Putting SCCS
keywords into comments in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/aliases</em> files allows you to track the last
version and date of edit:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">header to be added to file: </i>
#       /etc/hosts header 
#       %M%      %I%         %H% %T% 
#       %W% 
<i class="lineannotation">keywords filled in after getting file from SCCS: </i>
#       /etc/hosts header 
#       hosts        1.32        12/29/90 16:37:52 
#       @(#)hosts        1.32</pre></blockquote>


Once the headers have been added to the map source files, put them
under SCCS administration:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /etc</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>mkdir SCCS</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>/usr/ccs/bin/sccs admin -ialiases aliases</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>/usr/ccs/bin/sccs admin -ihosts hosts</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>/usr/ccs/bin/sccs get aliases hosts</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


The copies of the files that are checked out of SCCS control are
read-only. Someone making a casual change to a map is forced to go
and check it out of SCCS properly before doing so. Using SCCS, each
change to a file is documented before the file gets put back under
SCCS control. If you always return a file to SCCS before it is
converted into an NIS map, the SCCS control file forms an audit trail
for configuration changes:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /etc</b></tt> 
nismaster# <tt class="userinput"><b>sccs prs hosts</b></tt>

If any change to the hosts or aliases file breaks, SCCS can be used
to find the exact lines that were changed and the time the change was
made (for confirmation that the modification caused the network
problems).</p>


The two disadvantages to using SCCS for NIS maps are
that<a name="INDEX-698" />
<a name="INDEX-699" /> all changes must be made as
root and that it won't work for the password file. The
superuser must perform all file checkouts and modifications, unless
the underlying file permissions are changed to make the files
writable by nonprivileged users. If all changes are made by
<em class="emphasis">root</em>, then the SCCS logs do not contain
information about the user making the change. The password file falls
outside of SCCS control because its contents will be modified by
users changing their passwords, without being able to check the file
out of SCCS first. Also, some files, such as
<em class="emphasis">/etc/group</em>, have no comment lines, so you cannot
use SCCS keywords <a name="INDEX-700" /> <a name="INDEX-701" />in them.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.2.6. Using alternate map source files</h3>


You may decide to use nonstandard
source<a name="INDEX-702" />
<a name="INDEX-703" /> files for various NIS maps on the master
server, especially if the master server is not going to be an NIS
client. Alternatively, you may need to modify the standard NIS
<em class="emphasis">Makefile</em> to build your own NIS maps. Approaches
to both of these problems are discussed in this section.</p>


Some system administrators prefer to build the NIS password map from
a file other than <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>, giving them finer
control over access to the server. Separating the host's and
the NIS password files is also advantageous if there are password
file entries on the server (such as those for dial-in UUCP) that
shouldn't be made available on all NIS clients. To avoid
distributing UUCP password file entries to all NIS clients, the NIS
password file should be kept separately from
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> on the master server. The master can
include private UUCP password file entries and can embed the entire
NIS map file via <em class="emphasis">nsswitch.conf.</em></p>


If you de-couple the NIS password map from the master server's
password file, then the NIS <em class="emphasis">Makefile</em> should be
modified to reflect<a name="INDEX-704" /> <a name="INDEX-705" /> the new dependency. Refer back to the
procedure described in <a href="ch03_02.html#nfs2-CHP-3-SECT-2.2">Section 3.2.2, "Installing the NIS master server"</a>.</p>
