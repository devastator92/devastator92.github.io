The simplicity and transparency provided by NFS and NIS must be
weighed against security concerns. Providing access to all files to
all users may not be in the best interests of security, particularly
if the files contain sensitive or proprietary data. Not all hosts may
be considered equally secure or "open," so access may be
restricted to certain users. Transparency must be limited when
dealing with secured hosts: if you have taken precautions to prevent
unauthorized access to a machine, you don't want someone to be
able to sit down and use an open window or logged-in terminal to
access the secured machine. To enforce access restrictions, you
always want password verification for users, which means eliminating
some of the network transparency provided by NIS.
</p><p>

This chapter describes mechanisms for tightening access restrictions
to machines and filesystems. It is not intended to be a complete list
of security loopholes and their fixes. The facilities and
administrative techniques covered are meant to complement the network
transparency provided by NFS and NIS while still enforcing local
security measures. For a more detailed treatment of security issues,
refer to <em class="emphasis">Practical Unix Security</em>, by Garfinkel
and Spafford (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1996).

One area of concern is user access to hosts on <a name="INDEX-1653" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1654" /></a>the network. <a href="ch12_01.html#nfs2-CHP-12-FIG-1">Figure 12-1</a> shows several classes of permissions to
consider, reflecting the ways in which a user might access a host
from another host on the network.

Remote logins are not the only concern; remote
<a name="INDEX-1655" /></a>execution of commands using
<em class="emphasis">rsh</em> should be considered in the same context.
This section covers only login <a name="INDEX-1656" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1657" /></a>restrictions; we'll look at
protecting data in NFS filesystems later in this chapter. Local login
restrictions are defined by the local host's password file, NIS
password maps, and the use of netgroups. Across the network, access
is determined by the notion of trusted hosts and trusted users.
</p><p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.1. Trusted hosts and trusted users</h3>

Defining a <em class="emphasis">trusted host</em> requires two machines:
one <a name="INDEX-1658" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1659" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1660" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1661" /></a>that
will be trusted and one that is extending the trust to it. The local
host <em class="emphasis">lh</em> trusts remote host
<em class="emphasis">rh</em> if users can log into <em class="emphasis">lh</em>
from <em class="emphasis">rh</em> without supplying their passwords.
Similarly, a user is trusted if he or she can log into a host from
some remote machine without supplying a password. Trust is defined
only for the local host; users and machines may be trusted on some
systems but not on others.
</p><p>

The relationships between hosts often
<a name="INDEX-1662" /></a>define the realm of trusted
users and trusted hosts. Two NIS or NFS clients, for example, may
trust all users and all other client hosts. On the NFS server, only
other servers may be trusted hosts and only the system administration
staff may be trusted users.
</p><p>

<a name="ch12-3-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>WARNING: </b> 
The following trusted user and trusted host descriptions apply in an
environment in which you do not have to be wary of users or outsiders
who will attempt to compromise security. These are basic security
measures that fit in with the other network management strategies
discussed in this book. If you need to secure your systems against
all attacks, then you must consider the effects of having security
compromised on any machine in your network. Again, these extensive
security mechanisms are discussed in <em class="citetitle">Practical Unix
Security</em>.
</p><p>
</blockquote>

Some of the common patterns of trusting hosts and users are:</p><p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Server-Server</i></dt>
<dd>
Generally, servers trust each other. A <a name="INDEX-1663" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1664" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1665" /></a>few users can be trusted in
server-to-server relationships if each server has a password file
that contains a subset of the NIS password map, or a password file
with no NIS references. To emphasize the previous warning, extending
trust between servers means that if one server is compromised, then
they all <a name="INDEX-1666" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1667" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1668" /></a>are.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>Server-Client</i></dt>
<dd>
Most clients should trust the servers
<a name="INDEX-1669" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1670" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1671" /></a>and users on the servers. A
system administrator may need to run performance monitoring daemons
on the client from the server and require transparent access to the
client. Similarly, the server may be used to distribute files to the
clients on a regular basis.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>Client-Server</i></dt>
<dd>
This is probably the most restrictive
<a name="INDEX-1672" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1673" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1674" /></a>relationship. Only users with a
need to use a service are generally given transparent access to the
servers. Remote access to the server for access to a server's
printer can be controlled via the <em class="emphasis">-u</em> option to
the <em class="emphasis">lpadmin</em> command, instead of by trusting
client machines on the server.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>Client-Client</i></dt>
<dd>
Client-client relationships depend upon how
<a name="INDEX-1675" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1676" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1677" /></a>you have centralized your disk
resources. If all files live on one or more fileservers, then
client-to-client relationships are generally relaxed. However, if you
are using the clients as isolated systems, with some per-client
storage containing private data, then client-client relationships
look more like those between clients and servers. The scope of the
client-client relationships depends upon the sensitivity of the data
on the clients: if you don't want other users to see the
private data, then you must treat the client machine like a server.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

The <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em> and
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> files (in each user's home
directory) define the set of trusted hosts, users, and user-host
pairs for each system. Again, trust and transparent access are
granted by the machine being accessed remotely, so these
configuration files vary from host to host. The
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file is maintained by each user and
specifies a list of hosts or user-host pairs that are also parsed for
determining if a host or user<a name="INDEX-1678" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1679" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1680" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1681" /></a> is trusted.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.2. Enabling transparent access</h3>

Both <em class="emphasis">rlogin</em> and <em class="emphasis">rsh</em> use the
<em class="emphasis">ruserok</em>( ) library routine <a name="INDEX-1682" /></a>to bypass the normal login and
password security mechanism. The <em class="emphasis">ruserok</em>( )
routine is<a name="INDEX-1683" /></a> invoked on the server side of a
connection to see if the remote user gets transparent (i.e., no
password prompt) access. To understand the semantics, let's
look at its function prototype:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">int ruserok(const char *rhost, int suser, const char *ruser,
     const char *luser);</pre></blockquote>

The <em class="emphasis">rhost</em> parameter is the name of the remote
host from where the remote user is. The <em class="emphasis">ruser</em>
parameter is the login name of the remote user. The
<em class="emphasis">luser</em> parameter is the name of local login name
that the remote user wants transparent access to. Often
<em class="emphasis">luser</em> and <em class="emphasis">ruser</em> are the
same, but not always. The <em class="emphasis">suser</em> parameter is set
to 1 if the UID of luser is 0, i.e., superuser. Otherwise,
<em class="emphasis">suser</em> is set to 0.
</p><p>

<em class="emphasis">ruserok</em>( ) checks first if
<em class="emphasis">luser</em> exists; i.e., does
<em class="emphasis">getpwnam</em>( ) return success for <em class="emphasis">luser</em>
? It then determines if the remote user and hostname given
are trusted on the <em class="emphasis">local</em> host; it is usually
called by the remote daemon for these utilities during its startup.
If the user or host are not trusted, then the user must supply a
password to log in or get "Permission denied" errors when
attempting to use <em class="emphasis">rsh</em>. If the remote host trusts
the user and host, execution (or login) proceeds without any other
verification of the user's identity.
</p><p>

The <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> file contains either hostnames
or host-user pairs:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">hostname [username]</pre></blockquote>

If a username follows the hostname, only that
combination<a name="INDEX-1684" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1685" /></a> of user and hostnames is trusted.
Netgroup names, in the form <em class="emphasis">+@group</em>, may be
substituted for either hostnames or usernames. As with the password
file, using a plus sign (<tt class="literal">+</tt>) for an entry includes
the appropriate NIS map: in the first column, the hosts map is
included, and in the second column, the password map is included.
Entries that grant permission contain the hostname, a host and
username, or a netgroup inclusion.
</p><p>

The following is <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em> on host
<em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em>:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">wahoo 
bitatron + 
corvette johnc 
+@source-hosts 
+@sysadm-hosts +@sysadm-users</pre></blockquote>

The first example trusts all users on host
<em class="emphasis">wahoo</em>. Users on <em class="emphasis">wahoo</em> can
<em class="emphasis">rlogin</em> to <em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em> without
a password, but only if the <em class="emphasis">ruser</em> and
<em class="emphasis">luser</em> strings are equal.The second example is similar to the first, except that
any remote user from <em class="emphasis">bitatron</em> can claim to be
any local user and get access as the local user; i.e.,
<em class="emphasis">luser</em> and <em class="emphasis">ruser</em> do not have
to be equal. This is certainly useful to the users who have access to
<em class="emphasis">bitatron</em>, but it is very relaxed (or lax)
security on <em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em>. The third example is the
most restrictive. Only user <em class="emphasis">johnc</em> is trusted on
host <em class="emphasis">corvette</em>, and of course
<em class="emphasis">luser</em> and <em class="emphasis">ruser</em> (both
"johnc") must be the same. Other users on host
<em class="emphasis">corvette</em> are not trusted and must supply a
password when logging in to <em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em>.
</p><p>

The last two entries use netgroups to define lists of hosts and
users. The <em class="emphasis">+@source-hosts</em> entry trusts all hosts
whose names appear in the <em class="emphasis">source-hosts</em> netgroup.
If usernames are given as part of the netgroup triples, they are
ignored. This means that hostname wildcards grant overly generous
permissions. If the <em class="emphasis">source-hosts</em> netgroup
contained <em class="emphasis">(,stern,)</em>, then using this netgroup in
the first column of <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> effectively
opens up the machine to all hosts on the network. If you need to
restrict logins to specific users from specific machines, you must
use either explicit names or netgroups in both the first and second
column of <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>.
</p><p>

The last example does exactly this. Instead of trusting one
host-username combination, it trusts all combinations of hostnames in
<em class="emphasis">sysadm-hosts</em> and the usernames in
<em class="emphasis">sysadm-users</em>. Note that the
<em class="emphasis">usernames</em> in the
<em class="emphasis">sysadm-hosts</em> netgroup and the
<em class="emphasis">hostnames</em> in the
<em class="emphasis">sysadm-users</em> netgroup are completely ignored.
</p><p>

Permission may be revoked by
<a name="INDEX-1686" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1687" /></a>preceding the host or user
specification with a minus sign <tt class="literal">(-</tt>):
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">-wahoo 
+ -@dangerous-users</pre></blockquote>

The first entry denies permission to all users on host
<em class="emphasis">wahoo</em>. The second example negates all users in
the netgroup <em class="emphasis">dangerous-users</em> regardless of what
machine they originate from (the plus sign (+) makes the remote
machine irrelevant in this entry).
</p><p>

If you want to deny permission to everything in both the hosts and
password NIS maps, leave <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> empty.
</p><p>

The <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file uses the same syntax as the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> file, but it is parsed
<em class="emphasis">after</em> <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>. The sole
exception to this rule is when granting remote permission to
<em class="emphasis">root</em>. When the superuser attempts to access a
remote host, the <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> file is ignored and
only the <em class="emphasis">/.rhosts</em> file is read. For all other
users, the <em class="emphasis">ruserok( )</em> routine first reads
<em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>. If it finds a positive match, then
transparent access is granted. If it finds a negative match, and
there is no <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file for
<em class="emphasis">luser</em>, then transparent access is denied.
Otherwise, the <em class="emphasis">luser</em> 's
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file is parsed until a match, either
positive or negative, is found. If an entry in either file denies
permission to a remote user, the file parsing stops at that point,
even if an entry further down in the file grants permission to that
user and host combination.
</p><p>

Usernames that are not the same on all systems are handled through
the user's <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file. If you are user
<em class="emphasis">julie</em> on your desktop machine
<em class="emphasis">vacation</em>, but have username
<em class="emphasis">juliec</em> on host <em class="emphasis">starter</em>, you
can still get to that remote host transparently by adding a line to
your <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file on
<em class="emphasis">starter</em>. Assuming a standard home directory
scheme, your <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file would be
<em class="emphasis">/home/juliec/.rhosts</em> and should contain the name
of the machine you are logging in from and your username on the
originating machine:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">vacation julie</pre></blockquote>

From <em class="emphasis">vacation</em>, you can execute commands on
<em class="emphasis">starter</em> using:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>rsh starter -l juliec "ls -l"</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

or:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>rlogin starter -l juliec</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

On <em class="emphasis">starter</em>, the <em class="emphasis">ruserok( )</em>
routine looks for a <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file for user
<em class="emphasis">juliec</em>, your username on that system. If no
entry in <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> grants you permission
(probably the case because you have a different username on that
system), then your <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file entry maps your
local username into its remote equivalent. You can also use netgroups
in <em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> files, with the same warnings that
apply to using them in <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em>.
</p><p>

As a network manager, watch for overly permissive
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> files. Users may accidentally grant
password-free access to any user on the network, or map a foreign
username to their own Unix username. If you have many password files
with private, non-NIS managed entries, watch the use of
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> files. Merging password files to
eliminate non-uniform usernames may be easier than maintaining a
constant lookout for <a name="INDEX-1688" /></a>unrestricted access granted through a
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> file.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.3. Using netgroups</h3>

Netgroups have been used in several examples<a name="INDEX-1689" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1690" /></a>
already to show how triples of host, user, and domain names are used
in granting access across the network. The best use of netgroups is
for the definition of splinter groups of a large NIS domain, where
creating a separate NIS domain would not justify the administrative
effort required to keep the two domains synchronized.
</p><p>

Because of the variety of ways in which netgroups are applied, their
use and administration are sometimes counterintuitive. Perhaps the
most common mistake is defining a netgroup with host or usernames not
<a name="INDEX-1691" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1692" /></a>present
in the NIS maps or local host and password files. Consider a netgroup
that includes a hostname in another NIS domain:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">remote-hosts   (poi,-,-), (muban,-,-)</pre></blockquote>

When a user attempts to <em class="emphasis">rlogin</em> from host
<em class="emphasis">poi</em>, the local server-side daemon attempts to
find the hostname corresponding to the IP address of the originating
host. If <em class="emphasis">poi</em> cannot be found in the NIS
<em class="emphasis">hosts.byaddr</em> map, then an IP address, instead of
a hostname, is passed to <em class="emphasis">ruserok( )</em>. The
verification process fails to match the hostname, even though it
appears in the netgroup. Any time information is shared between NIS
domains, the appropriate entries must appear in both NIS maps for the
netgroup construction to function as expected.
</p><p>

Even though netgroups are specified as host and user pairs, no
utility uses both names together. There is no difference between the
following two netgroups:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">group-a         (los, mikel,) (bitatron, stern, ) 
group-b         (los, -,) (bitatron, -,) (-, mikel, ) (-, stern, )</pre></blockquote>

Things that need hostnames  --  the first column of
<em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em> or NFS export lists  --  produce
the set of hosts {<em class="emphasis">los, bitatron</em>} from both
netgroups. Similarly, anything that takes a username, such as the
password file or the second column of
<em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>, always finds the set
{<em class="emphasis">mikel, stern</em>}. You can even mix-and-match these
two groups in <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>. All four of the
combinations of the two netgroups, when used in both columns of
<em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>, produce the same net effect: users
<em class="emphasis">stern</em> and <em class="emphasis">mikel</em> are trusted
on hosts <em class="emphasis">bitatron</em> and <em class="emphasis">los</em>.
</p><p>

The triple-based format of the netgroups map clouds the real function
of the netgroups. Because all utilities parse either host or
usernames, you will find it helpful to define netgroups that contain
only host or usernames. It's easier to remember what each group
is supposed to do, and the time required to administer a few extra
netgroups will be more than made up by time not wasted chasing down
strange permission problems that arise from the way the
<em class="emphasis">netgroups</em> map is used.
</p><p>

An example here helps to show how the <em class="emphasis">netgroup</em>
map <a name="INDEX-1693" /></a>can
produce unexpected results. We'll build a netgroup containing a
list of users and hosts that we trust on a server named
<em class="emphasis">gate</em>. Users in the netgroup will be able to log
in to <em class="emphasis">gate</em>, and hosts in the netgroup will be
able to mount filesystems from it. The netgroup definition looks like
this:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">gate-group   (,stern,), (,johnc,), (bitatron, -,), (corvette, -,)</pre></blockquote>

In the <em class="emphasis">/etc/dfs/dfstab</em> file on
<em class="emphasis">gate</em>, we'll add a host access restriction:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">share -o rw=gate-group /export/home/gate</pre></blockquote>

No at-sign (<tt class="literal">@</tt>) is needed to include the netgroup
name in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/dfs/dfstab</em> file. The
<em class="emphasis">netgroup</em> map is searched first for the names in
the <em class="emphasis">rw=</em> list, followed by the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> map.
</p><p>

In <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em> on
<em class="emphasis">gate</em>, we'll include the
<em class="emphasis">gate-group</em> netgroup:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">+ +@gate-group</pre></blockquote>

To test our access controls, we go to a machine not in the netgroup
 --  NFS client <em class="emphasis">vacation</em>  --  and attempt
to mount <em class="emphasis">/export/home/gate</em>. We expect that the
<em class="emphasis">mount</em> will fail with a "Permission
denied" error:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">vacation# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount gate:/home/gate/home/gate</b></tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>/mnt</b></tt>
vacation#</pre></blockquote>

The mount completes without any errors. Why doesn't this
netgroup work as expected?
</p><p>

The answer is in the wildcards left in the host fields in the
netgroup entries for users <em class="emphasis">stern</em> and
<em class="emphasis">johnc</em>. Because a wildcard was used in the host
field of the netgroup, <em class="emphasis">all</em> hosts in the NIS map
became part of <em class="emphasis">gate-group</em> and were added to the
access list for <em class="emphasis">/export/home/gate</em>. When creating
this netgroup, our intention was probably to allow users
<em class="emphasis">stern</em> and <em class="emphasis">johnc</em> to log in
to <em class="emphasis">gate</em> from any host on the network, but
instead we gave away access rights.
</p><p>

A better way to manage this problem is to define two netgroups, one
for the users and one for the hosts, so that wildcards in one
definition do not have strange effects on the other. The modified
<em class="emphasis">/etc/netgroup</em> file looks like this:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">gate-users:   (,stern,), (,johnc,) 
gate-hosts:   (bitatron,,), (corvette,,)</pre></blockquote>

In the <em class="emphasis">/etc/dfs/dfstab</em> file on
<em class="emphasis">gate</em>, we use the <em class="emphasis">gate-hosts</em>
netgroup:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">share -o rw=gate-hosts /export/home/gate</pre></blockquote>

and in <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em>, we use the netgroup
<em class="emphasis">gate-users</em>. When host information is used, the
<em class="emphasis">gate-hosts</em> group explicitly defines those hosts
in the group; when usernames are needed, the
<em class="emphasis">gate-users</em> map lists just those users. Even
though there are wildcards in each group, those wildcards are in
fields that are not referenced <a name="INDEX-1694" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1695" /></a>when <a name="INDEX-1696" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1697" /></a>the maps <a name="INDEX-1698" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1699" /></a>are used in these function-specific
ways.
