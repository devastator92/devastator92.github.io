Routers and gateways join multiple IP networks, forwarding <a name="INDEX-2721" /></a>packets between the networks. A single
organization may have multiple IP networks because it has multiple
buildings, multiple sites, or multiple subgroups that require their
own networks. For example, the history and math departments at a
university are likely to each have their own IP networks, just as an
engineering and manufacturing facility separated by several miles
will have independent networks. <a href="ch17_02.html#nfs2-CHP-17-SECT-2">Section 17.2, "Network partitioning hardware"</a> discussed
network partitioning using routers, and some of the performance
considerations when running NFS and NIS in an internetworked
environment. This appendix explores the mechanics of IP packet
routing in greater detail.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-APP-A-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">A.1. Routers and their routing tables</h2>

A router has a unique IP address on each network interface;
associated <a name="INDEX-2722" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2723" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2724" /></a>with each IP address is also a unique
hostname. A common convention is to add a suffix associated with the
network number to the name of the host used on the each network
interface as shown in this <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em>
fragment:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-60">[60]</a>
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-60" /></a>[60]Of course, identifying a
host's interfaces in <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> is not
sufficient if you are using DNS. An excellent treatment of how to set
up multiple interfaces for a host in DNS is discussed on the Web in
the document "Frequently Asked Questions about Kerberos"
by Ken Hornstein, available (at the time this book was written) at
<a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/CCS/people/kenh/kerberos-faq.html">http://www.nrl.navy.mil/CCS/people/kenh/kerberos-faq.html</a>.
Look for the section entitled "How should I configure my DNS
for Kerberos?" Even if you are not using Kerberos,
Hornstein's recommendation for "multiple address records
per host" is a logical way to configure multiple interfaces in
DNS, because his choice associates a single name, such as
<em class="emphasis">fred.widget.com</em>, with multiple interface
specific names, such as <em class="emphasis">fred-200.widget.com</em> and
<em class="emphasis">fred-201.widget.com</em>.</p><p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#

To send a packet to another network, the local host needs some
picture of the network and its connections to other networks.
Ideally, this picture presents other networks as a "black
box" outside of some local gateway, rather than an itemization
of a route to every host on every attached network. This paradigm is
how we view the U.S. Post Office. Once you drop a letter in the
mailbox, the route it takes may involve trucks, planes, or people,
and the decisions about routing vehicles are left up to the people
doing the delivery.
</p><p>

A host's picture of the local network's connections to
other IP networks is contained in the kernel's routing table.
This table may be modified in three ways:
</p><p>

<ul><li>
Dynamic routing information is
<a name="INDEX-2726" /></a>sent periodically by routers that
advertise themselves using some well-known protocols, and daemons
such as <em class="emphasis">in.routed</em> send and interpret route
announcements and update the routing table.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-61">[61]</a>
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-61" /></a>[61]The
protocol used by <em class="emphasis">in.routed</em> is called RIP, for
Routing Information Protocol. There are other routing protocols that
send less information or that allow hosts to perform preferential
routing when multiple gateways are present, but a discussion of these
protocols is beyond the scope of this book.</p><p> </blockquote>
</li><li>
Static routing involves hand-crafting
a<a name="INDEX-2727" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2728" /></a> route table. Static routing is
typically used when there is only one router on a network, so a
single route suffices for all outbound traffic. Client machines often
set up static routing to avoid having to listen to the regular route
information broadcasts (see <a href="appa_02.html#nfs2-APP-A-SECT-2">Section A.2, "Static routing"</a> later
in this appendix).
</p><p>
</li><li>
Route redirection requests are
<a name="INDEX-2729" /></a>sent by routers that are asked to
forward packets to networks for which the chosen router is not the
best choice. These route table updates are sent in
<a name="INDEX-2730" /></a><em class="emphasis">ICMP redirect</em>
messages.
</p><p>
</li></ul>
The routing table determines how to get to foreign IP networks. You
can examine the current routing table using <em class="emphasis">netstat -r</em>
:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>netstat -r</b></tt> 
Routing tables 
Destination         Gateway              Flags    Refcnt Use        Interface

default             gatehost             UG       0      0          hme0</pre></blockquote>

The term "gateway" is used somewhat
<a name="INDEX-2731" /></a>improperly in both
<em class="emphasis">netstat -r</em> and the following discussion. A
gateway performs services at the application layer in the protocol
stack, while a router is concerned only with the IP layer. The
routing tables show IP routes, and titling the
<em class="emphasis">Gateway</em> column <em class="emphasis">Router</em>
instead would be more correct. However, many people associate
<em class="emphasis">Router</em> with a dedicated IP router, so the less
specific term <em class="emphasis">Gateway</em> is used.
</p><p>

The information in the routing table determines how to get to a
particular remote host or network, and shows the usage statistics for
each route. The destination column shows the remote address; if it is
a remote network, the address has a .0 suffix to indicate that it is
a network number.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-62">[62]</a> Note that you can get to multiple
networks through a single gateway. The gateway listed in the routing
tables is just the first step that must be taken to reach the remote
network; additional routing information on the first gateway directs
a packet to another gateway if required.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-62" /></a>[62]Of course, if you are using
classless IP addressing (see <a href="ch01_03.html#nfs2-CHP-1-SECT-3.4">Section 1.3.4, "Classless IP addressing"</a>), network
numbers are likely to not fall in discrete 8-bit widths. Thus in a
classless environment, it would be more precise to say that if the
destination is a remote network, the last N bits of the address will
be zeroes to indicate that the first 32 - N bits of the address are a
network number.</p><p> </blockquote>

The Flags column describes the gateway:</p><p>

<dl>
<dt><i>U</i></dt>
<dd>
The gateway is up. If this flag appears in <em class="emphasis">netstat
-r</em>, the gateway is probably up.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>G</i></dt>
<dd>
To get to the destination address, packets must go through a gateway.
The gateway's name is in the second column.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>H</i></dt>
<dd>
The gateway is a "host gateway" and is directly connected
to the network listed as the destination. In the first line of the
routing table in the previous example, destination 131.40.191.1 is
the IP address of <em class="emphasis">gatehost</em>, the gateway
referenced in several other route table entries. Host gateways are
always listed with their full IP addresses as the destination and are
generally at the far end of a point-to-point link.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>D</i></dt>
<dd>
The route was added after receiving an ICMP redirect message. The
local host probably sent a packet to some other router, such as
<em class="emphasis">gatehost</em>, with a destination network of
131.40.208.0. <em class="emphasis">gatehost</em> consulted its routing
tables and found that the router to this network was
<em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em>, and to get to
<em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em> it had to send the packet back out on
the same network interface on which it was received. The IP routing
algorithm realizes that it should never have been handed a packet for
this network in the first place, so it sends an ICMP redirect message
to the originator informing it of a better route to network
131.40.208.0. Using static routes in a network with multiple gateways
can lead to a steady stream of ICMP redirect requests unless the
transmitting hosts update their route tables. <a href="appa_01.html#nfs2-APP-A-FIG-1">Figure A-1</a> shows the generation of an ICMP redirect
message.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="nfs2-APP-A-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="318" alt="Figure A-1" src="figs/nfs2.aa01.gif" width="423" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure A-1. ICMP redirect generation</h4>

The last column in the output of <em class="emphasis">netstat -r</em>
shows the physical or pseudo device used to reach the gateway. The
last three routes deserve some additional explanation. The route with
<em class="emphasis">wahoo</em> as the gateway describes the local
host's connection to the local network. This is known as the
interface route of the machine. The next entry shows the loopback
device, which is listed as a host gateway. The last line is a
<em class="emphasis">default</em> routing entry, which is used as a
catchall if the destination IP network cannot be matched to any
explicit route in the table.
</p><p>

The combination of the flags U, G, and H implies "This host is
the gateway to this network": the U flag means the gateway is
up, the G flag means the packets must go through a gateway, and the H
flag indicates that the remote network is connected to the host
listed in the route table. The gateway host has at least one network
interface and one or more point-to-point links. A gateway listed with
flags U and G has two or more network interfaces and is acting as a
routing host. The lack of the H flag means that the remote network
isn't attached directly to the gateway; the gateway host listed
in the routing table is merely a stepping stone on the way to that
remote network.
</p><p>

Armed with the route tables, we can locate the host on our local
network that can forward our packets to any destination host. Since
we need the MAC address of the destination to send a packet, this
presents a problem for the transmitter when the receiver is on
another network. How do packets actually get to the remote network?
</p><p>

Let's assume that <em class="emphasis">wahoo</em>, at IP address
131.40.52.15, has mounted a filesystem through one or more gateways
from the NFS server <em class="emphasis">bigguy</em> at IP address
131.40.208.10. To send a packet to <em class="emphasis">bigguy</em>,
<em class="emphasis">wahoo</em> looks for its IP address in its routing
table. It finds it, with <em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em> named as the
gateway to this network. If the remote IP network was not matched to
a destination in the routing tables, the default route, which uses
<em class="emphasis">gatehost</em>, would be used.
<em class="emphasis">wahoo</em> sends its packet to
<em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em>, filling in the MAC address for
<em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em> but the <em class="emphasis">IP
address</em> for <em class="emphasis">bigguy</em>.
</p><p>

When <em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em> receives the packet, it realizes
that the IP network in the destination field is not its own. It
forwards the packet, using its own routing information to locate a
gateway to network 131.40.208.0. <em class="emphasis">gatehost2</em> sends
the packet to the next gateway, putting in the remote gateway's
MAC address but leaving the destination IP address of
<em class="emphasis">bigguy</em> intact. Eventually, the packet is
received by a gateway that is on network 131.40.208.0; this gateway
recognizes that its IP network and the destination IP network in the
packet are the same, and it sends it along the local area network to
<em class="emphasis">bigguy</em>. The last gateway to forward the packet
is the one that inserts <em class="emphasis">bigguy</em>'s MAC
address in the packet.
</p><p>

By default, hosts on more than one network are configured as routers
in order to forward packets from one interface to another. In some
cases, it's desirable to disable automatic IP forwarding, so
that the host may communicate on multiple networks but it will not
act as a transparent conduit between them. Refer back to the NIS
security issues raised in <a href="ch12_03.html#nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-3.2">Section 12.3.2, "Making NIS more secure"</a>. If an NIS
client can bind to an NIS server, it can dump the password map from
the server. To protect the contents of your password file map, you
may want to make it impossible for clients outside the local network
to bind to a local NIS server. With IP forwarding enabled, any client
can use <em class="emphasis">ypset</em> to get to any NIS server, but if
IP forwarding is disabled on the host that connects the local network
to other networks, <em class="emphasis">ypset</em> never makes it beyond
this router host. It's also a good idea to disable IP
forwarding on machines that join your company network to a larger
network such as the Internet. This creates a firewall between your
internal networks and the outside world: hosts outside the router
cannot get packets into your company networks.
</p><p>

How you disable IP forwarding depends on your system. In Solaris,
this is done by creating a special file:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>touch /etc/notrouter</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

If the <em class="emphasis">/etc/notrouter file</em> is present when the
<a name="INDEX-2732" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2733" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2734" /></a>system
boots, then the system will not perform IP forwarding. If you want to
turn off IP forwarding immediately, then do the following:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forwarding 0</b></tt> </pre></blockquote>
