We've seen how NIS operates on master <a name="INDEX-614" /></a>servers, slave servers, and
clients, and how clients get map information from the servers. Just
knowing how NIS works, however, does not lead to its efficient use.
NIS servers must be configured so that map information remains
consistent on all servers, and the number of servers and the load on
each server should be evaluated so that there is not a
user-noticeable penalty for referring to the NIS maps.</p><p>


Ideally, NIS streamlines system administration tasks by allowing you
to update configuration files on many machines by making changes on a
single host. When designing a network to use NIS, you must ensure
that its performance cost, measured by all users doing
"normal" activities, does not exceed its advantages. This
chapter explains how to design an NIS network, update and distribute
NIS map data, manage multiple NIS domains, and integrate NIS hostname
services with the Domain Name Service.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">4.1. NIS network design</h2>


At this point, you should be able to set <a name="INDEX-615" /></a> <a name="INDEX-616" /></a>up NIS on master and slave servers and
have a good understanding of how map changes are propagated from
master to slave servers. Before creating a new NIS network, you
should think about the number of domains and servers you will need.
NIS network design entails deciding the number of domains, the number
of servers for each domain, and the domain names. Once the framework
has been established, installation and ongoing maintenance of the NIS
servers is fairly straightforward.</p><p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.1. Dividing a network into domains</h3>


The number of NIS domains that you <a name="INDEX-617" /></a> <a name="INDEX-618" /></a>need depends upon the division of your
computing resources. Use a separate NIS domain for each group of
systems that has its own system administrator. The job of maintaining
a system also includes maintaining its configuration information,
wherever it may exist.</p><p>


Large groups of users sharing network resources may warrant a
separate NIS domain if the users may be cleanly separated into two or
more groups. The degree to which users in the groups share
information should determine whether you should split them into
different NIS domains. These large groups of users usually correspond
very closely to the organizational groups within your company, and
the level of information sharing within the group and between groups
is fairly well defined.</p><p>


A good example is that of a large university, where the physics and
chemistry departments have their own networked computing
environments. Information sharing within each department will be
common, but interdepartment sharing is minimal. The physics
department isn't that interested in the machine names used by
the chemistry department. The two departments will almost definitely
be in two distinct NIS domains if they do not have the same system
administrator (each probably gets one of its graduate students to
assume this job). Assume, though, that they share an administrator
 --  why create two NIS domains? The real motivation is to clearly
mark the lines along which information is commonly shared. Setting up
different NIS domains also keeps users in one department from using
machines in another department.</p><p>


Conversely, the need to create splinter groups of a few users for
access to some machines should not warrant an independent NIS domain.
Netgroups are better suited to handle this problem, because they
create subsets of a domain, rather than an entirely new domain. A
good example of a splinter group is the system administration staff
 --  they may be given logins on central servers, while the bulk
of the user community is not. Putting the system administrators in
another domain generally<a name="INDEX-619" /></a> <a name="INDEX-620" /></a> creates more problems than the new
domain was intended to solve.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.2. Domain names</h3>


Choosing domain names is not nearly <a name="INDEX-621" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-622" /></a>as
difficult as gauging the number of domains needed. Just about any
naming convention can be used provided that domain names are unique.
You can choose to apply the name of the group as the NIS domain name;
for example, you could use <em class="emphasis">history</em>,
<em class="emphasis">politics</em>, and <em class="emphasis">comp-sci</em> to
name the departments in a university.</p><p>


If you are setting up multiple NIS domains that
are<a name="INDEX-623" /></a> <a name="INDEX-624" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-625" /></a> based on hierarchical divisions,
you may want to use a multilevel naming scheme with dot-separated
name components:</p><p>


<blockquote class="simplelist">

cslab.comp-sci </p><p>

staff.comp-sci </p><p>

profs.history </p><p>

grad.history</p><p>

</blockquote>


The first two domain names would apply to the "lab"
machines and the departmental staff machines in the computer science
department, while the two <em class="emphasis">.history</em> domain names
separate the professors and graduate students in that department.</p><p>


Multilevel domain names are useful if you will be using an Internet
Domain Name Service. You can assign NIS domain names based on the
name service domain names, so that every domain name is unique and
also identifies how the additional name service is related to NIS.
Integration of Internet name services and NIS is covered <a name="INDEX-626" /></a> <a name="INDEX-627" /></a>at the end of this
chapter.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-4-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.3. Number of NIS servers per domain</h3>


The number of servers per NIS domain <a name="INDEX-628" /></a> <a name="INDEX-629" /></a> <a name="INDEX-630" /></a>is determined by the size of the domain
and the aggregate service requirements for it, the level of failure
protection required, and any physical network constraints that might
affect client binding patterns. As a general rule, there should be at
least two servers per domain: one master and one slave. The
dual-server model offers basic protection if one server crashes,
since clients of that server will rebind to the second server. With a
solitary server, the operation of the network hinges on the health of
the NIS server, creating both a performance bottleneck and a single
point of failure in the network.</p><p>


Increasing the number of NIS servers per domain reduces the impact of
any one server crashing. With more servers, each one is likely to
have fewer clients binding to it, assuming that the clients are
equally likely to bind to any server. When a server crashes, fewer
clients will be affected. Spreading the load out over several hosts
may also reduce the number of domain rebindings that occur during
unusually long server response times. If the load is divided evenly,
this should level out variations in the NIS server response time due
to server crashes and reboots.</p><p>


There is no golden rule for allocating a certain number of servers
for every <em class="emphasis">n</em> NIS clients. The total NIS service
load depends on the type of work done on each machine and the
relative speeds of client and server. A faster machine generates more
NIS requests in a given time window than a slower one, if both
machines are doing work that makes equal use of NIS. Some interactive
usage patterns generate more NIS traffic than work that is
CPU-intensive. A user who is continually listing files, compiling
source code, and reading mail will make more use of password file
entries and mail aliases than one who runs a text editor most of the
time.</p><p>


The bottom line is that very few types of work generate endless
streams of NIS requests; most work makes casual references to the NIS
maps separated by at most several seconds (compare this to disk
accesses, which are usually separated by milliseconds). Generally,
30-40 NIS clients per server is an upper limit if the clients and
servers are roughly the same speed. Faster clients need a lower
client/server ratio, while a server that is faster than its clients
might support 50 or more NIS clients. The best
<a name="INDEX-631" /></a> <a name="INDEX-632" /></a>way to gauge server usage is to watch for
<em class="emphasis">ypbind</em> requests for domain bindings, indicating
that clients are timing out waiting for NIS service. Methods for
observing binding requests are discussed in <a href="ch13_04.html#nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-4.2">Section 13.4.2, "Displaying and analyzing client bindings"</a>.</p><p>


Finally, the number of servers required may depend on the physical
structure of the network. If you have decided to use four NIS
servers, for example, and have two network segments with equal
numbers of clients, joined by a bridge or router, make sure you
divide the NIS servers equally on both sides of the
network-partitioning hardware. If you put only one NIS server on one
side of a bridge or router, then clients on that side will almost
always bind to this server. The delay experienced by NIS requests in
traversing the bridge approaches any server-related delay, so that
the NIS server on the same side of the bridge will answer a
client's request before a server on the opposite side of the
bridge, even if the closer server is more heavily loaded than the one
across the bridge. With this configuration, you have undone the
benefits of multiple NIS servers, since clients on the one-server
side of the bridge bind to the same server in most cases. Locating
