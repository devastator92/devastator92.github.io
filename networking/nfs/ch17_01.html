This chapter explores network diagnostics and partitioning schemes

interface to the network. <a name="INDEX-2529" /></a><a name="INDEX-2530" /></a></p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-17-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">17.1. Network congestion and network interfaces</h2>


A network that was designed to ensure transparent <a name="INDEX-2531" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2532" /></a>access to filesystems and to provide
"plug-and-play" services for new clients is a prime
candidate for regular expansion. Joining several independent networks
with routers, switches, hubs, bridges, or repeaters may add to the
traffic level on one or more of the networks. However, a network
cannot grow indefinitely without eventually experiencing congestion
problems. Therefore, don't grow a network without planning its
physical topology (cable routing and limitations) as well as its
logical design. After several spurts of growth, performance on the
network may suffer due to excessive loading.</p><p>


The problems discussed in this section affect NIS as well as NFS
service. Adding network partitioning hardware affects the
transmission of broadcast packets, and poorly placed bridges,
switches, or routers can create new bottlenecks in frequently used
network "virtual circuits." Throughout this chapter, the
emphasis will be on planning and capacity evaluation, rather than on
low-level electrical details.</p><p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-17-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.1.1. Local network interface</h3>


Ethernet cabling problems, such as incorrect<a name="INDEX-2533" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2534" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2535" /></a> or poorly made Category-5 cabling,
affect all of the machines on the
<a name="INDEX-2536" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2537" /></a>network.
Conversely, a local interface problem is visible only to the machine
suffering from it. An Ethernet interface device driver that cannot
handle the packet traffic is an example of such a local interface
problem.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-2538" /></a>The <em class="emphasis">netstat</em>
tool gives a good
<a name="INDEX-2539" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2540" /></a>indication of the reliability of the local
physical network interface:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>netstat -in</b></tt> 
Name Mtu  Net/Dest     Address      Ipkts   Ierrs  Opkts   Oerrs Collis Queue  
lo0  8232 127.0.0.0    127.0.0.1    7188    0      7188     0     0      0     
hme0 1500 129.144.8.0  129.144.8.3  139478  11     102155   0     3055   0</pre></blockquote>


The first three columns show the network interface, the maximum
transmission unit (MTU) for that interface, and the network to which
the interface is connected. The <em class="emphasis">Address</em> column
shows the local IP address (the hostname would have been shown had we
not specified <em class="emphasis">-n</em>). The last five columns contain
counts of the total number of packets sent and received, as well as
errors encountered while handling packets. The collision count
indicates the number of times a collision occurred when
this<a name="INDEX-2541" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2542" /></a> host was transmitting.</p><p>


Input errors can be caused by:</p><p>


<ul><li><a name="INDEX-2543" /></a>Malformed or
runt packets, damaged on the network by electrical problems.</p><p></li><li><a name="INDEX-2544" /></a>Bad CRC
checksums, which may indicate that another host has a network
interface problem and is sending corrupted packets. Alternatively,
the cable connecting this workstation to the network may be damaged
and corrupting frames as they are received.</p><p></li><li>The device driver's inability to receive the packet
<a name="INDEX-2545" /></a>due to insufficient buffer space.</p><p></li></ul>
A high output error rate indicates a fault in the local host's
connection to the network or prolonged periods of collisions (a
jammed network). Errors included in this count are exclusive of
packet collisions.</p><p>


Ideally, both the input and output error rates should be as close to
zero as possible, although some short bursts of errors may occur as
cables are unplugged and reconnected, or during periods of intense
network traffic. After a power failure, for example, the flood of
packets from every diskless client that automatically reboots may
generate input errors on the servers that attempt to boot all of them
in parallel. During normal operation, an error rate of more than a
fraction of 1% deserves investigation. This rate seems incredibly
small, but consider the data rates on a Fast Ethernet: at 100 Mb/sec,
the maximum bandwidth of a network is about 150,000 minimum-sized
packets each second. An error rate of 0.01% means that fifteen of
those 150,000 packets get damaged each second. Diagnosis and
resolution of low-level electrical problems such as CRC errors is
beyond the scope of this book, although such an effort should be
undertaken if high error rates <a name="INDEX-2546" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2547" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2548" /></a>are persistent.</p><p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-17-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<a name="INDEX-2549" /></a><a name="INDEX-2550" /></a><h3 class="sect2">17.1.2. Collisions and network saturation</h3>


Ethernet is similar to an<a name="INDEX-2551" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2552" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2553" /></a> old party-line telephone: everybody
listens at once, everybody talks at once, and sometimes two talkers
start at the same time. In a well-conditioned network, with only two
hosts on it, it's possible to use close to the maximum
network's bandwidth. However, NFS clients and servers live in a
burst-filled environment, where many machines try to use the network
at the same time. When you remove the well-behaved conditions, usable
network bandwidth decreases rapidly.</p><p>


On the Ethernet, a host first checks for a transmission in progress
on the network before attempting one of its own. This process is
known as<a name="INDEX-2554" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2555" /></a> <em class="emphasis">carrier
sense</em>. When two or more hosts transmit packets at exactly
the same time, neither can sense a carrier, and a collision results.
Each host recognizes that a collision has occurred, and backs off for
a period of time, <em class="emphasis">t,</em> before attempting to
transmit again. For each successive retransmission attempt that
results in a collision, <em class="emphasis">t</em> is increased
exponentially, with a small random variation. The variation in
back-off periods ensures that machines generating collisions do not
fall into lock step and seize the network.</p><p>


As machines are added to the network,
the<a name="INDEX-2556" /></a> probability of a collision
increases. Network utilization is measured as a percentage of the
ideal bandwidth consumed by the traffic on the cable at the point of
measurement. Various levels of utilization are usually compared on a
logarithmic scale. The relative decrease in usable bandwidth going
from 5% utilization to 10% utilization, is about the same as going
from 10% all the way to 30% utilization.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-2557" /></a>Measuring network utilization
requires a LAN analyzer or similar device. Instead of measuring the
traffic load directly, you
<a name="INDEX-2558" /></a>can
use the average collision rate as seen by all hosts on the network as
a good indication of whether the network is overloaded or not. The
<a name="INDEX-2559" /></a>collision
rate, as a percentage of output packets, is one of the best measures
of network utilization. The <em class="emphasis">Collis</em> field in the
output of <em class="emphasis">netstat -in</em> shows the number of
collisions:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>netstat -in</b></tt> 
Name Mtu  Net/Dest     Address      Ipkts   Ierrs  Opkts   Oerrs Collis Queue  
lo0  8232 127.0.0.0    127.0.0.1    7188    0      7188     0     0      0     
hme0 1500 129.144.8.0  129.144.8.3  139478  11     102155   0     3055   0</pre></blockquote>


The collision rate for a host is the number of collisions seen by
that host divided by the number of packets it writes, as shown in
<a href="ch17_01.html#nfs2-CHP-17-FIG-1">Figure 17-1</a>.</p><p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-17-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="36" alt="Figure 17-1" src="figs/nfs2.1701.gif" width="306" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 17-1. Collision rate calculation</h4>

Collisions are counted only when the local host is transmitting; the
collision rate experienced by the host is dependent on its network
usage. Because network transmissions are random events, it's
possible to see small numbers of collisions even on the most lightly
loaded networks. A collision rate<a name="INDEX-2560" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2561" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2562" /></a> upwards of 5% is the first sign of
network loading, and it's an indication that partitioning the
network may <a name="INDEX-2563" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2564" /></a>be advisable.</p><p>
