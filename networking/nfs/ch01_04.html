<h2 class="sect1">1.4. Transport layer</h2>


The transport layer has two major jobs: it <a name="INDEX-178" /> <a name="INDEX-179" />must subdivide user-sized data buffers
into network layer-sized datagrams, and it must enforce any desired
transmission control such as reliable delivery. Two transport
protocols that sit on top of IP are <a name="INDEX-180" />
<a name="INDEX-181" />the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which offer
different delivery guarantees.</p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-1-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.1. TCP and UDP</h3>


TCP is best known as the first half <a name="INDEX-182" /> <a name="INDEX-183" />of TCP/IP; as discussed in
this and the preceding sections, the acronyms refer to two distinct
services. TCP provides reliable, sequenced delivery of packets. It is
ideally suited for connection-oriented communication, such as a
remote login or a file transfer. Missing packets during a login
session is both frustrating and dangerous  --  what happens if
<em class="emphasis">rm *.o</em> gets truncated to <em class="emphasis">rm *</em>
? TCP-based services are generally geared toward
long-lived network connections, and TCP is used in any case when
ordered datagram delivery is a requirement. There is overhead in TCP
for keeping track of packet delivery order and the parts of the data
stream that must be resent. This<a name="INDEX-184" /> is <em class="emphasis">state</em>
information. It's not part of the data stream, but rather
describes the state of the connection and the data transfer.
Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP
an<a name="INDEX-185" />
<a name="INDEX-186" />
inherently <em class="emphasis">stateful</em> protocol. Because there is
state, TCP can adapt its data flow rate when the network is
congested.</p>


UDP is a no-frills transport protocol: it sends large datagrams to a
remote host, but it makes no assurances about their delivery or the
order in which they are delivered. UDP is best for connectionless
communication on local area networks in which no context is needed to
send packets to a remote host and there is no concern about
congestion. Broadcast-oriented services use UDP, as do those in which
repeated, out of sequence, or missed requests have no harmful side
effects.</p>


<a name="INDEX-187" />Reliable and unreliable
delivery is
the<a name="INDEX-188" />
<a name="INDEX-189" />
primary distinction between TCP and UDP. TCP will always try to
replace a packet that gets lost on the network, but UDP does not. UDP
packets can arrive in any order. If there is a network bottleneck
that drops packets, UDP packets may not arrive at all. It's up
to the application built on UDP to determine that a packet was lost,
and to resend it if necessary. The state maintained by TCP has a
fixed cost associated with it, making UDP a faster protocol on
low-latency, high-bandwidth links. The price paid for speed (in UDP)
is unreliability and added complexity to the higher level
applications that must handle lost packets.</p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-1-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.2. Port numbers</h3>


A host may have many TCP and UDP connections<a name="INDEX-190" /> at any time. Connections to a host are
distinguished by a <em class="emphasis">port number</em>, which serves as
a sort of mailbox number for incoming datagrams. There may be many
processes using TCP and UDP on a single machine, and the port numbers
distinguish these processes for incoming packets. When a user program
opens a TCP or UDP socket, it gets connected to a port on the local
host. The application may specify the port, usually when trying to
reach some service with a well-defined port number, or it may allow
the operating system to fill in the port number with the next
available free port number.</p>


When a packet is received and passed to the TCP or UDP handler, it
gets directed to the interested user process on the basis of the
destination port number in the packet. The quadruple of:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port</pre></blockquote>


uniquely identifies every interhost connection in the network. While
many processes may be talking to the process that handles remote
login requests (therefore their packets have the same destination IP
addresses and port numbers), they will have unique pairs of source IP
addresses and port numbers. The destination port number determines
which of the many processes using TCP or UDP gets the data.</p>


On most Unix systems port numbers below 1024 are reserved for the
processes executing with superuser privileges, while ports 1024 and
above may be used by any user. This enforces some measure of security
by preventing random user applications from accessing ports used by
servers. However, given that most nodes on the network don't
run Unix, this measure of <a name="INDEX-191" /> <a name="INDEX-192" />security is<a name="INDEX-193" /> <a name="INDEX-194" /> very <a name="INDEX-195" />questionable.</p>
