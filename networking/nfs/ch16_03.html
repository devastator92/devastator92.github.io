<h2 class="sect1">16.3. Benchmarking</h2>

Benchmarks of NFS performance <a name="INDEX-2409" /> <a name="INDEX-2410" />
<a name="INDEX-2411" />should
be judged in terms of their realistic reproduction of the NFS call
arrival rates and RPC distribution. A benchmark that sends out a
steady, regularly spaced stream of NFS requests tests only how well a
server operates under ideal conditions. If you can't run actual
client workloads on a network, there are a few conditions to be aware
of:
</p>

<ul><li>
Ensure that the RPC mixture of the<a name="INDEX-2412" /> benchmark matches that of your NFS
clients. Running a benchmark that does a large percentage of write
operations tells you little about how NFS servers perform if your
clients mostly read files. Conversely, if you have a large percentage
of write operations, the wrong benchmark RPC mixture overstates
expected server performance. Use the <em class="emphasis">nfsstat</em>
tool to<a name="INDEX-2413" /> <a name="INDEX-2414" />
determine accurate RPC mixtures for your servers. You may want to run
several benchmarks, testing performance with client loads simulating
normal and heavy conditions. The SPEC website,
<a href="http://www.spec.org/">http://www.spec.org</a>, contains information about
the <em class="emphasis">SFS97</em> RPC-generating benchmark, which is
widely used by NFS vendors to compare their servers to one another.
</p>
</li><li>
Watch out for
<a name="INDEX-2415" />cache effects. Clients cache parts of
files that have been recently read and not modified. Repeatedly
reading the same file may only generate a fraction of the desired
number of <em class="emphasis">read</em> RPC requests.
</p>
</li><li>
When gauging a particular limit, such as the maximum number of short
RPCs or the maximum NFS disk transfer rate, try to isolate the
quantity under test as much as possible. Stress testing is often
useful for determining a server's behavior under severe loads,
but it helps to stress only one component at a time.
</p>
</li></ul>
The last point rings of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. In
<a name="INDEX-2416" />short, Heisenberg stated that the
process of observing something changes it. A goal of NFS performance
measurement should be to change the actual performance being measured
as little as possible. Using networked measurement tools that add to
the traffic level on a congested network, or running suites of
utilities that drain the server's CPU, color the results of any
benchmarks.
</p>

When benchmarking a network router or gateway,
ensure<a name="INDEX-2417" />
<a name="INDEX-2418" />
that you are measuring the desired capacity and not another
constraint. To determine maximum IP packet forwarding rates, for
example, you should put a packet generator on one side of the router
and a packet counting device such as a LAN analyzer on the other.
Timing <em class="emphasis">rpc</em> transfers of large files through the
router gives a fair indication of maximum disk transfer rates or
maximum network data transfer rates, but tells you little about the
router's network interface because the packets forwarded are
not "typical" in size.
</p>

The goal of the next section is to indicate the common areas in which
performance bottlenecks are created. The remainder of this chapter
covers techniques for relaxing these constraints on the server as
much as possible. The majority of the following discussion concerns
NFS, although NIS-specific topics<a name="INDEX-2419" /> <a name="INDEX-2420" /> <a name="INDEX-2421" /> will be introduced where applicable.
