<h2 class="sect1">12.2. How secure are NIS and NFS?</h2>

NFS and NIS have bad reputations<a name="INDEX-1700" /> <a name="INDEX-1701" /> <a name="INDEX-1702" /> <a name="INDEX-1703" />
for security. NFS earned its reputation because of its default RPC
security flavor AUTH_SYS (see <a href="ch12_04.html#nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-4.1">Section 12.4.1, "RPC security"</a>
later in this chapter) is very weak. There are
<a name="INDEX-1704" />
<a name="INDEX-1705" />better security flavors available for
NFS on Solaris and other systems. However, the better security
flavors are not available for all, or even most NFS implementations,
resulting in a practical dilemma for you. The stronger the NFS
security you insist on, the more homogenous your computing
environment will become. Assuming that secure file access across the
network is a requirement, another option to consider is to not run
NFS and switch to another file access system. Today there are but two
practical choices:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>SMB (also known as CIFS)</i></dt>
<dd>
This limits your desktop environment<a name="INDEX-1706" />
<a name="INDEX-1707" /> to Windows. However, as discussed in
<a href="ch10_02.html#nfs2-CHP-10-SECT-2.1">Section 10.2.1, "NFS versus SMB (CIFS)"</a>, if you want strong security,
you'll have to have systems capable of it, which means running
Windows clients and servers throughout.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>DCE/DFS</i></dt>
<dd>
At the time this book was written, DCE/DFS was
<a name="INDEX-1708" />
<a name="INDEX-1709" />available
as an add-on product developed by IBM's Pittsburgh Laboratory
(also known as Transarc) unit for Solaris, IBM's AIX, and
Windows. Other vendors offer DCE/DFS for their own operating systems
(for example, HP offers DCE/DFS). So DCE/DFS offers the file access
solution that is both heterogeneous and very secure.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

NIS has earned its reputation because it
<a name="INDEX-1710" />
<a name="INDEX-1711" />has
no authentication at all. The risk of this is that a successful
attacker could provide a bogus NIS map to your users by having a host
he controls masquerade as an NIS server. So the attacker could use a
bogus host map to redirect the user to a host he controls (of course
DNS has the same issue).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-19">[19]</a> Even more insidious, the attacker could gain root access
when logging into a system, simply by providing a bogus passwd map.
Another risk is that the encrypted password field from the
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em> map in NIS is available to everyone, thus
permitting attackers to perform faster password guessing than if they
manually tried passwords via login attempts.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-19" />[19]An enhancement to DNS,
DNSSEC has been standardized but it is not widely deployed.</p>
</blockquote>

These issues are corrected by NIS+. If you are uncomfortable with NIS
security then you ought to consider NIS+. In addition to Solaris,
NIS+ is supported by AIX and HP/UX, and a client implementation is
available for Linux. By default NIS+ uses the RPC/dh security
discussed in <a href="ch12_05.html#nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-5.4">Section 12.5.4, "AUTH_DH: Diffie-Hellman authentication"</a>. As discussed in
<a href="ch12_05.html#nfs2-CHP-12-SECT-5.4.10">Section 12.5.4.10, "How secure is RPC/DH?"</a>, RPC/dh security is not state of
the art. Solaris offers an enhanced Diffie-Hellman security for NIS+,
but so far, other systems have not added it to their NIS+
implementations.
</p>

Ultimately, the future of directory services is LDAP, but at
the<a name="INDEX-1712" />
<a name="INDEX-1713" /> time this book was written, the common
security story for LDAP on Solaris, AIX, HP/UX, and Linux was not as
strong as that of NIS+. You can get very secure LDAP out of Windows
2000, but then your clients and servers will be limited to running
<a name="INDEX-1714" />
<a name="INDEX-1715" />
<a name="INDEX-1716" />
<a name="INDEX-1717" />Windows
2000.
