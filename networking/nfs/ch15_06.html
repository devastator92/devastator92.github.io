<a name="INDEX-2364" /><a name="INDEX-2365" /><h2 class="sect1">15.6. Asynchronous NFS error messages</h2>


This final section provides an in-depth<a name="INDEX-2366" /> <a name="INDEX-2367" /> <a name="INDEX-2368" />
look at how an NFS client does write-behind, and what happens if one
of the write operations fails on the remote server. It is intended as
an introduction to the more complex issues of performance analysis
and tuning, many of which revolve around similar subtleties in the
implementation of NFS.</p>


When an application calls <em class="emphasis">read( )</em> or
<em class="emphasis">write( )</em> on a <a name="INDEX-2369" />
<a name="INDEX-2370" />local or Unix filesystem (UFS) file, the
kernel uses inode and indirect block pointers to translate the offset
in the file into a physical block number on the disk. A low-level
physical I/O operation, such as "write this buffer of 1024
bytes to physical blocks 5678 and 5679" is then passed to the
disk device driver. The actual disk operation is scheduled, and when
the disk interrupts, the driver interrupt routine notes the
completion of the current operation and schedules the next. The block
device driver queues the requests for the disk, possibly reordering
them to minimize disk head movement.</p>


Once the disk device driver has a read or write request, only a media
failure causes the operation to return an error status. Any other
failures, such as a permission problem, or the filesystem running out
of space, are detected by the filesystem management routines before
the disk driver gets the request. From the point of view of the
<em class="emphasis">read( )</em> and <em class="emphasis">write( )</em> system
calls, everything from the filesystem write routine down is a black
box: the application isn't necessarily concerned with how the
data makes it to or from the disk, as long as it does so reliably.
The actual write operation occurs asynchronously to the application
calling <em class="emphasis">write( )</em>. If a media error occurs
 --  for example, the disk has a bad sector brewing  --  then
the media-level error will be reported back to the application during
the next <em class="emphasis">write( )</em> call or during the
<em class="emphasis">close( )</em> of the file containing the bad block.
When the driver notices the error returned by the disk controller, it
prints a media failure message on the console.</p>


A similar mechanism is used by NFS to report errors on the
"virtual media" of the remote fileserver. When
<em class="emphasis">write( )</em> is called on an NFS-mounted file, the
data buffer and offset into the file are handed to the NFS write
routine, just as a UFS write calls the lower-level disk driver write
routine. Like the disk device driver, NFS has a driver routine for
scheduling write requests: each new request is put into the page
cache. When a full page has been written, it is handed to an NFS
async thread that performs the RPC call to the remote server and
returns a result code. Once the request has been written into the
local page cache, the <em class="emphasis">write( )</em> system call
returns to the application  --  just as if the application was
writing to a local disk. The actual NFS write is synchronous to the
NFS async thread, allowing these threads to perform write-behind. A
similar process occurs for reads, where the NFS async thread performs
some read-ahead by fetching NFS buffers in anticipation of future
<em class="emphasis">read( )</em> system calls. See <a href="ch07_03.html#nfs2-CHP-7-SECT-3.2">Section 7.3.2, "Client I/O system"</a> for details on the operation of the NFS async
threads.</p>


Occasionally, an NFS async thread detects an error when attempting to
write to a remote server, and the error is printed (by the NFS async
thread) on the client's console. The scenario is identical to
that of a failing disk: the <em class="emphasis">write( )</em> system call
has already returned, so the error must be reported on the console in
the next similar system call.</p>


The format of these error messages is:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">NFS write error on host mahimahi: No space left on device.
(file handle: 800006 2 a0000 3ef 12e09b14 a0000 2 4beac395)</pre></blockquote>


The number of potential failures when writing to an NFS-mounted disk
exceeds the few media-related errors that would cause a UFS write to
fail. <a href="ch15_06.html#nfs2-CHP-15-TABLE-1">Table 15-1</a> gives some examples.</p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-15-TABLE-1" /><h4 class="objtitle">Table 15-1. NFS-related errors </h4><table border="1">



<tr>
<th>
Error</p></th>
<th>
Typical Cause</p></th>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
Permission denied</p></td>
<td>
Superuser cannot write to remote filesystem.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
No space left on device</p></td>
<td>
Remote disk is full.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Stale filehandle</p></td>
<td>
File or directory has been removed on the server without the
client's knowledge.</p></td>
</tr>


</table><p>


Both the "Permission denied" and the "No space left
on device" errors <a name="INDEX-2371" /> <a name="INDEX-2372" />would have been detected on
a local filesystem, but the NFS client has no way to determine if a
write operation will succeed at some future time (when the NFS async
thread eventually sends it to the server). For example, if a client
writes out 1KB buffers, then its NFS async threads write out 8KB
buffers to the server on every 8th call to <em class="emphasis">write(
)</em>. Several seconds may go by between the time the first
<em class="emphasis">write( )</em> system call returns to the application
and the time that the eighth call forces the NFS async thread to
perform an RPC to the NFS server. In this interval, another process
may have filled up the server's disk with some huge write
requests, so the NFS async thread's attempt to write its 8-KB
buffer will fail.</p>


If you are consistently seeing NFS writes fail due to full
filesystems or permission problems, you can usually chase down the
user or process that is performing the writes by identifying the file
being written. Unfortunately, Solaris does not provide any utility to
correlate the filehandles printed in the error messages with the
pathname of the file on the remote server. Filehandles are generated
by the NFS server and handed opaquely to the NFS client. The NFS
client cannot make any assumptions as to the structure or contents of
the filehandle, enabling servers to change the way they generate the
filehandle at any time. In practice, the structure of a Solaris NFS
filehandle has changed little over time. The following script takes
as input the filehandle printed by the NFS client and generates the
corresponding server filename:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-42">[42]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-42" />[42]Thanks to Brent
Callaghan for providing the basis for this script.</p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/bin/sh

 if [ $# -ne 8 ]; then
            echo "Usage: fhfind &lt;filehandle&gt; e.g."
            echo
            echo "fhfind 1540002 2 a0000 4d 48df4455 a0000 2 25d1121d"
            exit 1
fi

FSID=$1
INUMHEX='echo $4 | tr [a-z] [A-Z]'

ENTRY='grep ${FSID} /etc/mnttab | grep -v lofs'
if [ "${ENTRY}" = "" ] ; then
            echo "Cannot find filesystem for devid ${FSID}"
            exit 1
fi
set - ${ENTRY}
 MNTPNT=$2

INUM='echo "ibase=16;${INUMHEX}" | bc'

echo "Searching ${MNTPNT} for inode number ${INUM} ..."
echo

find ${MNTPNT} -mount -inum ${INUM} -print 2&gt;/dev/null</pre></blockquote>


The script takes the expanded filehandle string from the NFS write
error and maps it to the full pathname of the file on the server. The
script is to be executed on the NFS server:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">mahimahi# <tt class="userinput"><b>fhfind 800006 2 a0000 3ef 12e09b14 a0000 2 4beac395</b></tt>
Searching /spare for inode number 1007 ...

/spare/test/info/data</pre></blockquote>


The eight values on the command line are the eight hex digits in the
filehandle reported in the NFS error message. The script makes strict
assumptions about the contents of the Solaris server filehandle. As
mentioned before, the OS vendor is free to change the structure of
the filehandle at any time, so there's no guarantee this script
will work on your particular configuration. The script takes
advantage of the fact that the filehandle contains the inode number
of the file in question, as well as the device id of the filesystem
in which the file resides. The script uses the device id in the
filehandle (<em class="emphasis">FSID</em> in line 10) to obtain the
filesystem entry from <em class="emphasis">/etc/mnttab</em> (line 13). In
line 11, the script obtains the inode number of the file (in hex)
from the filehandle, and applies the <em class="emphasis">tr</em> utility
to convert all lowercase characters into uppercase characters for use
with the <em class="emphasis">bc</em> calculator. Line 18 and 19 extract
the mount point from the filesystem entry, to later use it as the
starting point of the search. Line 21 takes the hexadecimal inode
number obtained from the filehandle, and converts it to its decimal
equivalent for use by <em class="emphasis">find</em>. In line 26, we
finally begin the search for the file matching the inode number.
Although <em class="emphasis">find</em> uses the mount point as the
starting point of the search, a scan of a large filesystem may take a
long time. Since there's no way to terminate the
<em class="emphasis">find</em> upon finding the file, you may want to kill
the process after it prints the path.</p>


Throughout this chapter, we used tools presented in previous chapters
to debug network and local problems. Once you determine the source of
the problem, you should be able to take steps to correct and avoid
it. For example, you can avoid delayed client write problems by
having a good idea of what your clients are doing and how heavily
loaded your NFS servers are. Determining your NFS workload and
optimizing your clients and servers to make the best use of available
resources requires tuning the network, the clients, and the servers.
