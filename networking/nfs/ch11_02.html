<h2 class="sect1">11.2. NFS and file locking</h2>

The NFS (Versions 2 and 3) protocol <a name="INDEX-1602" /> <a name="INDEX-1603" /> <a name="INDEX-1604" />does not support
file locking, but the NFS environment supports an ancillary protocol
called NLM, which <a name="INDEX-1605" />originally stood for "Network
Lock Manager." When an NFS filesystem on an NFS client gets a
request to lock a file, instead of an NFS remote procedure call, it
generates an NLM remote procedure call.
</p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.2.1. The NLM protocol</h3>

The NLM protocol consists of <a name="INDEX-1606" /> <a name="INDEX-1607" /> <a name="INDEX-1608" />
<a name="INDEX-1609" />remote procedure calls that pattern
fcntl arguments and results. Because blocking locks are supported (a
process blocks waiting for a lock that conflicts with another
holder), the NLM protocol has the notion of callbacks, from the file
server to the NLM client to notify that a lock is available. In this
way, the NLM client sometimes acts as an RPC server in order to
receive delayed results from lock calls.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.2.2. NLM recovery</h3>

The NFS protocol is stateless, but because<a name="INDEX-1610" />
<a name="INDEX-1611" />
<a name="INDEX-1612" /> file locking is inherently stateful,
NLM is stateful. This results in a more complex scheme to recover
from failures. There are three types of recovery scenarios to
consider:
</p>

<ul><li>
Server crash</p>
</li><li>
Client crash</p>
</li><li>
Network partition</p>
</li></ul>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.2.2.1. Server crash</h3>

When the NLM server crashes, NLM clients
<a name="INDEX-1613" />
<a name="INDEX-1614" />that are holding locks must reestablish
them on the server when it restarts. The NLM protocol deals with this
by having the status monitor on the server send a notification
message to the status monitor of each NLM client that was holding
locks. The initial period after a server restart is called the grace
period. During the grace period, only requests to reestablish locks
are granted. Thus, clients that reestablish locks during the grace
period are guaranteed to not lose their locks.
</p>

</div>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.2.2.2. Client crash</h3>

When an NLM client crashes, it is desirable that<a name="INDEX-1615" /> <a name="INDEX-1616" /> any locks it was holding at the time
be removed from all the NLM servers it had locks on. The NLM protocol
deals with this by having the status monitor on the client send a
message to each server's status monitor once the client
reboots. The client reboot indication tells the server that the
client no longer needs its locks.
</p>

Of course, if the client crashes and never comes back to life, the
client's locks will persist indefinitely. This is not good for
two reasons:
</p>

<ul><li>
Resources are indefinitely leaked.</p>
</li><li>
Eventually another client will want to get a conflicting lock on at
least one of the files the crashed client had locked. Thus the other
client is postponed indefinitely.
</p>
</li></ul>
This is one of the administrative issues you will <a name="INDEX-1617" /> <a name="INDEX-1618" />need to deal with,
which we will cover later in this chapter.
</p>

</div>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.2.2.3. Network partition</h3>

Suppose an NLM client is holding a lock, but
<a name="INDEX-1619" />
<a name="INDEX-1620" />the network route between it and the NLM
server goes down: a network partition. At this point, from the
perspective of the server, the situation is indistinguishable from a
client that crashes<a name="INDEX-1621" /> <a name="INDEX-1622" /> <a name="INDEX-1623" /> but never comes back. Again, this is a
situation you will need to handle.
</p>

</div>
</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.2.3. Mandatory locking and NFS</h3>

NLM supports only advisory whole file and <a name="INDEX-1624" />
<a name="INDEX-1625" />
<a name="INDEX-1626" /> <a name="INDEX-1627" />byte range
locking, and until NFS Version 4 is deployed, this means that the NFS
environment cannot support mandatory whole file and byte range
locking. The reason goes back to how mandatory locking interacts with
advisory <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> calls.
</p>

Let's suppose a process with ID 1867 issues an
<em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> exclusive lock call on the entire range of
a local file that has mandatory lock permissions set. This
<em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> call is an advisory lock. Now the process
attempts to write the file. The operating system can tell that
process 1867 holds an advisory lock, and so, it allows the write to
proceed, rather than attempting to acquire the advisory lock on
behalf of the process 1867 for the duration of the write. Now suppose
process 1867 does the same sequence on another file with mandatory
lock permissions, but this file is on an NFS filesystem. Process 1867
issues an <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> exclusive lock call on the
entire range of a file that has mandatory lock permissions set. Now
process 1867 attempts to write the file. While the NLM protocol has
fields in its lock requests to uniquely identify the process on the
client that locked the file, the NFS protocol has no fields to
identify the processes that are doing writes or reads. The file is
advisory locked, and it has the mandatory lock permissions set, yet
the NFS server has no way of knowing if the process that sent the
write request is the same one that obtained the lock. Thus, the NFS
server cannot lock the file on behalf of the NFS client. For this
reason, some NFS servers, including Solaris servers, refuse any read
or write to a file <a name="INDEX-1628" /> <a name="INDEX-1629" /> <a name="INDEX-1630" /> <a name="INDEX-1631" />with the mandatory lock permissions
set.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.2.4. NFS and Windows lock semantics</h3>

The NLM protocol supports byte range locking<a name="INDEX-1632" />
<a name="INDEX-1633" />
<a name="INDEX-1634" /> and share
reservations.
</p>

While Windows byte range locking is mandatory, on Unix servers it
will be advisory. To the dismay of Windows software developers, this
means that non-PC/NFS clients might step on PC/NFS clients, because
the non-PC/NFS client does not try to acquire a lock. It also means
that servers that support both NFS/NLM and SMB might not correctly
handle cases where an NFS client is doing a read or write to a file
that an SMB client has established a mandatory lock on.
</p>

PC/NFS clients will emulate share reservation semantics by issuing
the share reservation remote procedure calls to the NLM server.
However, most non-PC/NFS clients, or even local processes on Unix NLM
servers will not honor the deny semantics of the share reservation of
the PC/NFS client. Another problem with the emulation is that Windows
semantics expect the share reservation and exclusive file creation to
be atomic. The share reservation and file creation go out as separate
operations, hence no atomicity, allowing a window of vulnerability,
where a client can succeed in its exclusive create, but <a name="INDEX-1635" /> <a name="INDEX-1636" /> <a name="INDEX-1637" />not get the
<a name="INDEX-1638" />
<a name="INDEX-1639" />
<a name="INDEX-1640" />share
reservation.
