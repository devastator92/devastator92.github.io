<h2 class="sect1">9.5. Advanced map tricks</h2>

The automounter has several features that <a name="INDEX-1469" />complement the "normal"
NFS mount options. It can mount replicated filesystems from one of
several potential servers, and it can perform hierarchical mounts of
all of a server's directories when any one of them is
referenced. This section starts with a discussion of these advanced
automounter features, then explains how to get better performance out
of the automounter by converting direct map entries into indirect
maps and by using the automounter's subdirectory mount feature.
</p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-9-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.1. Replicated servers</h3>

Multiple location support in the automounter implements <a name="INDEX-1470" /> <a name="INDEX-1471" /> <a name="INDEX-1472" />
<a name="INDEX-1473" />a simple network load-balancing
scheme for replicated filesystems. At first glance, this seems to be
a bit of overkill; after all, you don't need or want
replication for read-write filesystems. However, serving large,
read-only filesystems such as the manpages may add to an NFS
server's request load. Having multiple servers share this load
improves performance by reducing the total load placed on the most
heavily used servers. Ideally, you want clients that are
"close" to each server to mount its filesystems, reducing
the amount of traffic that must go through bridges or routers.
</p>

For example, if you have four NFS servers that each export the
manpages, the best client mounting scheme is probably not to have
one-quarter of the clients mount <em class="emphasis">/usr/man</em> from
each server. Instead, clients should mount the manpages from the
server that is closest to them. Replicated filesystems are included
in automounter maps simply by listing all possible servers in the
map:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/usr/man        -ro     wahoo:/usr/man mahimahi:/usr/man \ 
                        thud:/usr/man onaga:/usr/man</pre></blockquote>

The backslash at the end of the first line continues this indirect
map entry onto the next line. If more than one
<em class="emphasis">server:directory</em> pair is listed in an
automounter map, the automounter pings all servers by sending a
request to the <em class="emphasis">null</em> procedure of all NFS
servers. From the set that responds, the automounter picks one that
is "closest" by comparing the address of the servers with
that of the clients. Ties are broken by using the server that
responded to the ping first. The selected server is used by the
automounter to serve the mount point.
</p>

There is also an element of load balancing at work here: if one of
the <em class="emphasis">/usr/man</em> servers is so heavily loaded with
other NFS traffic that it cannot reply to the ping before another
server on the same net, then the client will choose the other server
to handle its mount request. Solaris 2.6 introduced the feature of
client-side failover, which was discussed in <a href="ch06_05.html#nfs2-CHP-6-SECT-5">Section 6.5, "Replication"</a>. While it doesn't explicitly implement
load balancing, if, after the mount, one server becomes overloaded
enough, a client will find the server to be unresponsive and will
dynamically switch to another server. Keep in mind the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
If the <em class="emphasis">ro</em> mount option is not present, or if the
<em class="emphasis">soft</em> option is present, client-side failover is
not enabled, and in that situation, once a client performs a mount
from a server, it continues to use that server until it unmounts the
filesystem.
</p>
</li><li>
If the list of servers providing the filesystem changes, once the
filesystem is mounted, with or without failover, the client cannot
choose a different server before unmounting its first choice.
</p>
</li></ul>
You can use the first-answer feature of replicated map entries to
solve the multihomed host problem presented in <a href="ch16_05.html#nfs2-CHP-16-SECT-5.7">Section 16.5.7, "Multihomed servers"</a>. Let's say that you have an NFS server
on four networks, with hostnames <em class="emphasis">boris</em>,
<em class="emphasis">boris-bb2</em>, <em class="emphasis">boris-bb3</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">boris-bb4</em> on those networks. Mounting all
filesystems from <em class="emphasis">boris</em> makes the multihomed host
perform loopback packet routing, but using the "right"
hostname requires knowing which name is on your network. Building an
automounter map with replicated entries solves this problem by
letting the automounter find the fastest route to
<em class="emphasis">boris</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">natasha    -rw,hard       boris:/export/home/boris \ 
                              boris-bb2:/export/home/boris \ 
                              boris-bb3:/export/home/boris \ 
                              boris-bb4:/export/home/boris</pre></blockquote>

This would be an entry in the <em class="emphasis">auto_home</em> map.
Since the server pathnames are the same, you can use a shorter form
of the replicated map entry, putting all of the server names in a
comma-separated list:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">natasha  -rw,hard   boris,boris-bb2,boris-bb3,boris-bb4:/home/boris</pre></blockquote>

The network interface on <em class="emphasis">boris</em> that is closest
to the client will respond first, and each NFS client of
<em class="emphasis">boris</em> will mount
<em class="emphasis">/home/natasha</em> from the best network interface.
Note that the replicated mount points don't refer to multiple
filesystems, but rather multiple names for the same filesystem. The
automounter just provides a neat way of managing all of them in a
single place. Because <em class="emphasis">/export/home/natasha</em> is
mounted read-write, client-side failover is not enabled. This is
somewhat unfortunate since this is the one situation where
client-side failover of a writable filesystem is safe: the filesystem
is the same, because the physical host is the same. But the client
has no way of knowing that.
</p>

When the automounter pings
the<a name="INDEX-1474" /> remote servers, it's
performing the equivalent of:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">rpcinfo -u hostname nfs</pre></blockquote>

for each listed server. If you see a larger number of
<em class="emphasis">null</em> procedure calls than usual in the output of
<em class="emphasis">nfsstat</em> on the NFS server, it might indicate
that your automounter mounts of replicated filesystems are being
performed repeatedly. The <em class="emphasis">null</em> calls do not
require any disk accesses to service, but they can consume network
bandwidth on the server; if the number of <em class="emphasis">null</em>
calls becomes excessive it may be due to client machines continually
mounting and unmounting replicated filesystems. Changing the value of
the <em class="emphasis">-t</em> option to <em class="emphasis">automount</em>
(as discussed previously in <a href="ch09_02.html#nfs2-CHP-9-SECT-2.4">Section 9.2.4, "Tuning timeout values"</a>)
reduces the frequency of mounting and unmounting.
</p>

You can also examine the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rmtab</em> file on the
server to see how frequently its clients are mounting and unmounting
automounted filesystems. When a filesystem is mounted, an entry is
added to the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rmtab</em> file. When it gets
unmounted, the entry isn't deleted from the file  --  it is
commented out by making the first character in the line a pound sign
(<em class="emphasis">#</em>):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#epeche:/usr/share/man 
#haos:/usr/share/man 
#epeche:/usr/share/man 
depeche:/usr/share/man 
chaos:/usr/share/man</pre></blockquote>

In this example, client <em class="emphasis">depeche</em> has mounted
<em class="emphasis">/usr/share/man</em> three times, and client
<em class="emphasis">chaos</em> has mounted that filesystem twice. This
gives you client information to go along with the
<em class="emphasis">null</em> NFS RPC counts provided by
<em class="emphasis">nfsstat</em>  --  you can tell which clients have
been repeatedly mounting and unmounting a filesystem. Watch the size
of the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rmtab</em> file over time; if it grows
regularly and contains multiple entries for the same clients and
filesystems, then you may want to change the automounter timeout
value on<a name="INDEX-1475" />
<a name="INDEX-1476" />
<a name="INDEX-1477" />
<a name="INDEX-1478" /> those
clients.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">9.5.2. Hierarchical mounts</h3>

In addition to handling multiple servers<a name="INDEX-1479" /> <a name="INDEX-1480" /> for the same filesystem, the
automounter can mount multiple trees from the same server in a
hierarchy of mount points. Hierarchical <a name="INDEX-1481" />mounts are simply a special form of
indirect maps.
</p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-9-SECT-5.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.5.2.1. The -hosts map</h3>

The most widely used hierarchical<a name="INDEX-1482" />
<a name="INDEX-1483" />
mount is the builtin <em class="emphasis">-hosts</em> map, which mounts
all exported filesystems from a named host.
</p>

The <em class="emphasis">-hosts</em> map references only the hosts
database; the map semantics are built into the automounter. It is
usually mounted on <em class="emphasis">/net</em> indicating that it
contains filesystems from the entire network. The following line
would appear in the master map:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/net -hosts -nobrowse</pre></blockquote>

Except when using the enhanced <em class="emphasis">autofs</em>
automounter, a user can then force mounts of all filesystems from a
server by referencing the server's name as a subdirectory of
<em class="emphasis">/net</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>showmount -e wahoo</b></tt> 
/export1      (everyone) 
/export2  honeymoon 
/export3  honeymoon 
% <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /net/wahoo</b></tt> 
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ls -l</b></tt>
total 3
drwxrwxr-x  22 root     staff        512 Aug 12 16:02 export1
drwxrwxr-x   8 root     staff        512 Feb 18  1999 export2
drwxrwxr-x   9 root     staff        512 Sep  8 16:19 export3</pre></blockquote>

When the automounter has to mount a filesystem on
<em class="emphasis">/net</em>, it sends a request to the server asking
for all exported filesystems. The automounter sorts the filesystems
by pathname length, ensuring that subdirectories of exported
filesystems appear later in the list than their parents.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a> The original automounter would then mount each
item in the sorted list.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-14" />[14]If a directory pathname has a length of <em class="emphasis">x</em>
characters, then any of its subdirectory's pathnames
have length &gt; <em class="emphasis">x</em>. Sorting by pathname length
puts a parent directory ahead of all paths to its subdirectories.
</p> </blockquote>

The enhanced <em class="emphasis">autofs</em> automounter will lazily
mount each exported filesystem as soon as a process does something
significant such as changing its current working directory to an
exported filesystem:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /net/wahoo</b></tt> 
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ls -l</b></tt> 
total 3
dr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root           1 Sep 28 14:54 export1
dr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root           1 Sep 28 14:54 export2
dr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root           1 Sep 28 14:54 export3
% <tt class="userinput"><b>cd export1</b></tt>
% <tt class="userinput"><b>cd ..</b></tt>
% <tt class="userinput"><b>ls -l</b></tt>
total 3
drwxrwxr-x  22 root     root         512 Aug 12 16:02 export1
dr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root           1 Sep 28 14:54 export2
dr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root           1 Sep 28 14:54 export3
</pre></blockquote>

The act of doing the <em class="emphasis">cd export1</em>causes the automounter to perform an NFS
mount over the <em class="emphasis">/net/wahoo/export1</em>
<em class="emphasis">autofs</em> vnode. Thus, users cannot casually force
the client to mount each filesystem unless they do something like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% ls /net/wahoo/*</pre></blockquote>

This command invocation tells <em class="emphasis">ls</em> to read each
directory of each exported filesystem of <em class="emphasis">wahoo</em>.
The <em class="emphasis">autofs</em> filesystem considers an invocation of
its <em class="emphasis">readdir</em> entry point to be a significant
operation worthy of triggering an NFS mount.
</p>

There are a number of caveats for using the
<em class="emphasis">-hosts</em> map with automounters that don't
support lazy mounting of hierarchies:
</p>

<ul><li>
By including the entire <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database, the
hosts map references servers that are both local and on remote
networks; a casual reference to a remote server causes an NFS mount
to occur through a router or gateway.
</p>
</li><li>
If the server itself is slow, or has a large number of filesystems
(diskless client servers), then the <em class="emphasis">-hosts</em> map
has a definite performance impact.
</p>
</li><li>
Unmounts of the filesystems are done from the bottom up, in the
reverse order of the mounts. If a higher-level mount point is busy,
then an unmount of the entire hierarchy fails. When the automounter
fails to unmount a higher-level mount point, it must remount the
filesystems it just unmounted. It walks back down the hierarchy from
the busy mount point, mounting each filesystem. The remote
server's filesystems are mounted on an all-or-nothing basis.
</p>
</li><li>
Earlier in this section, we said that the "most widely used
hierarchical mount is the builtin <em class="emphasis">-hosts</em>
map." If you are not careful, it can be the most widely used
map, period. The reason why this is not good is that
<em class="emphasis">-hosts</em> is location-dependent. Once your users
get used to accessing resources like
<em class="emphasis">/net/wahoo/tools</em>, instead of accessing
<em class="emphasis">/tools</em>, it becomes difficult to move the
resource to a different physical location. It is best to discourage
use of <em class="emphasis">/net</em>. One way to do so is to respond
rapidly to requests to modify existing maps, or add new maps, and
also, bury the physical location several directories deep on the
server that holds the resource. Users will prefer pathnames like
<em class="emphasis">/tools/debugger</em> over
<em class="emphasis">/net/wahoo/export/software/tools/debugger</em>.
</p>
</li></ul>
These caveats don't apply to the enhanced
<em class="emphasis">autofs</em> automounter. However, by default it does
support browsing. Thus a new caveat is that if a network has lots of
hosts, then users that do:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ls /net</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

will trigger lots of network traffic as the automounter gets the list
of hosts from NIS. Thus, you should use the
<em class="emphasis">-nobrowse</em> option on the <em class="emphasis">-hosts</em>
map.
<a name="INDEX-1484" /> <a name="INDEX-1485" />
</p>



<a name="ch09-8-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b> 
Users sometimes complain that they cannot see a new filesystem
exported from a server. This is because a <em class="emphasis">/net</em>
mount from the server was in effect before the filesystem was
exported, and the automounter has to timeout the mount before
unmounting and remounting. Rather than waiting for that to happen, a
simple workaround is to tell your users to access the server under
<em class="emphasis">/net</em> with a name that differs by capitalizing
one letter of the hostname. This works because hostnames are
case-insensitive, yet Unix pathnames are case-sensitive. So, for
example, if <em class="emphasis">/net/wahoo</em> was in effect before
<em class="emphasis">wahoo:/export4</em> was exported, then simply
accessing <em class="emphasis">/net/Wahoo</em> will allow you to access
<em class="emphasis">export4</em> as well as 
the pre-existing
<em class="emphasis">export1</em>, <em class="emphasis">export2</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">export3</em>.

<h3 class="sect3">9.5.2.2. Hierarchical mounts in non -hosts maps</h3>

Let's return to our <em class="emphasis">/tools</em> example. Recall
that <em class="emphasis">/tools</em> has:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/tools/deskset 
/tools/sting 
/tools/news 
/tools/bugview</pre></blockquote>

and is an indirect automounter map for the
<em class="emphasis">/tools</em> directory, called
<em class="emphasis">auto_tools</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">deskset         -ro,intr mahimahi:/tools2/deskset 
sting                    mahimahi:/tools2/sting 
news                     thud:/tools3/news 
bugview                  jetstar:/usr/bugview</pre></blockquote>

<em class="emphasis">/tools/deskset</em> contains several subdirectories,
one of which is <em class="emphasis">wonderworks-v1.0.</em> You recently
get a Version 2.0 of Wonderworks, and you find that it requires more
disk space than what <em class="emphasis">mahimahi:/tools2/deskset</em>
has available. You have several choices here:
</p>

<ul><li>
Create a new map entry into <em class="emphasis">auto_tools</em> called
<em class="emphasis">deskset2</em> for the new version of wonderworks. The
problem with this is that your users expect to look in
<em class="emphasis">/tools/deskset</em>, and not
<em class="emphasis">/tools/deskset2</em> for the desktop productivity
tools.
</p>
</li><li>
Move the <em class="emphasis">deskset</em> directory from
<em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em> to a server with a large partition. The
problem is that this will impact existing users that have
<em class="emphasis">mahimahi:/tools2/deskset</em> mounted.
</p>
</li><li>
Create a hierarchical mount for the <em class="emphasis">deskset</em> map
entry such that <em class="emphasis">/tools/deskset/wonderworks-v2.0</em>
is mounted from somewhere else. This solution has none of the
disadvantages of the previous choices.
</p>
</li></ul>
To do the last choice requires the following steps:</p>

<ol><li>
Create a mount point for <em class="emphasis">wonderworks-v2.0</em> on
server <em class="emphasis">mahimahi</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">On mahimahi:</i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mkdir /tools/deskset/wonderworks-v2.0</b></tt></pre></blockquote>
</li>


<li>
Create a directory on another server (e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">wahoo:/export/tools/deskset/wonderworks-v2.0</em>)
with sufficient disk space, and copy the
<em class="emphasis">wonderworks-v2.0</em> package to it. If necessary,
export the directory via a new entry in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/dfs/dfstab</em> and the
<em class="emphasis">shareall</em> command.
</p>
</li><li>
Change the deskset entry in the <em class="emphasis">auto_tools</em> map
to:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">deskset         <tt class="userinput"><b>/ -ro,intr mahimahi:/tools2/deskset \</b></tt>
	                <tt class="userinput"><b>/wonderworks-v2.0</b></tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>-ro,intr</b></tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>mahimahi:/tools2/deskset</b></tt></pre></blockquote>
</li></ol>

Now when the user accesses <em class="emphasis">/tools/deskset</em>, he or
she will be able reference both
/<em class="emphasis">tools/wonderworks-v1.0</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/tools/wonderworks-v1.0</em>. 
</p>

As the example suggests, the syntax of a hierarchical mount's
map entry is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="emphasis">key-name</em> subdirectory1 [ -<em class="emphasis">mount-options</em> ] <em class="emphasis">server-filesystem-1</em> [ <em class="emphasis">subdirectory2</em> [ -mount-options ] <em class="emphasis">server-filesystem-2</em> ] ...</pre></blockquote>

where a <em class="emphasis">server-filesystem</em> is<a name="INDEX-1486" /> <a name="INDEX-1487" /> one of:

<h3 class="sect2">9.5.3. Conversion of direct maps</h3>

Direct mounts are useful for handling <a name="INDEX-1488" />
<a name="INDEX-1489" />
<a name="INDEX-1490" />nonuniform
naming schemes, but they may cause a number of performance problems
if several direct mount points are included in a directory that is
frequently searched. You can usually get better performance out of
the automounter by converting direct maps into indirect maps. Instead
of putting direct map mount points in the client filesystem, create
symbolic links that point to a staging area managed by an indirect
map.
</p>

Again, an example helps to explain the conversion process. Consider
replacing a direct map for <em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> with an
indirect map <em class="emphasis">auto_stage</em>. To convert the direct
map into an indirect map, we first create a symbolic link
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> that points to a staging area that
we'll let the automounter manage:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">Original direct map </i>
/usr/local      mahimahi:/local/$ARCH 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>ln -s /stage/local /usr/local</b></tt> 

<i class="lineannotation">New entry in auto_master map</i>
/stage          auto_stage      -ro 

<i class="lineannotation">New indirect map auto_stage containing</i>
local   -ro     mahimahi:/local/$ARCH</pre></blockquote>

Note that <em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> didn't exist before
we made the link, since it was managed by the automounter. Also, we
don't have to create the <em class="emphasis">/stage</em> staging
directory, since it is an indirect map mount point.
</p>

The symbolic link points to a subdirectory of the mount point managed
by the indirect map <em class="emphasis">auto_stage</em>. With the direct
map, any reference to <em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> is directed to
the <em class="emphasis">/stage</em> mount point, which causes the
automounter to mount the appropriate architecture-specific directory.
This makes <em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> look like a link to the
mount.
</p>

Let's say a user now accesses
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin/emacs</em>. The client kernel follows
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> down to the symbolic link, which
points to the <em class="emphasis">/stage/local</em> automounter mount
point. The automounter picks up the reference to
<em class="emphasis">/stage</em> as a reference to the
<em class="emphasis">auto_stage</em> map, and it uses the next component
 --  <em class="emphasis">local</em>  --  as a key in the map. This
causes <em class="emphasis">mahimahi:/local/$ARCH</em> to be automounted.
If you have several direct mount points, they can <a name="INDEX-1491" /> <a name="INDEX-1492" /> <a name="INDEX-1493" />all be converted
into links sharing a single <em class="emphasis">auto_stage</em> map.

/stage          auto_stage      -ro </pre></blockquote>

One problem with this approach is that the top-level root (
<em class="emphasis">/</em> ) directory is beginning to get cluttered. Of
course, one could simply add another component to the mount
directory. If we want to put everything under
<em class="emphasis">/auto</em>, then we could change indirect map entries
of the master map to:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Directory     Map             Mount Options 
/auto/home      auto_home       -nobrowse
/auto/net       -hosts          -nobrowse
/auto/tools     auto_tools      -ro 
/auto/source    auto_source     -rw
/auto/stage     auto_stage      -ro </pre></blockquote>

If you are using the <em class="emphasis">autofs</em> automounter, then
there is a more elegant approach: simply treat each indirect map as a
map entry in new indirect map called <em class="emphasis">auto_auto</em>.
To do this, the master map would look like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Directory     Map             Mount Options
/auto           auto_auto
/-              auto_direct</pre></blockquote>

The <em class="emphasis">auto_auto</em> map is an indirect map. Like all
other indirect maps, its first field has to be a directory relative
to <em class="emphasis">/auto</em>, its second field has to be a set of
mount options, and its third field has to be the name of the thing we
are mounting. Here is what <em class="emphasis">auto_auto</em> looks like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Directory    Options                     Map being mounted 
home           -fstype=autofs,nobrowse     auto_home
net            -fstype=autofs,nobrowse     -hosts
tools          -fstype=autofs,ro           auto_tools 
source         -fstype=autofs,rw           auto_source
stage          -fstype=autofs,ro           auto_stage</pre></blockquote>

The second and third fields in <em class="emphasis">auto_auto</em> are
basically swapped from what they would be in
<em class="emphasis">auto_master</em>. The difference is the presence of
the <em class="emphasis">fstype</em> option. This option is needed to
unambiguously tell the <em class="emphasis">autofs</em> automounter that
this is not map entry referring to an NFS-mounted filesystem.
</p>

There is no limit on multiple indirection. This fact allows you to
create sensible hierarchies that can be extended ad infinitum.
Let's return to the <em class="emphasis">auto_source</em> example,
which contains:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sunos5.6        -ro     srcserv:/source/sunos5.6 
sunos5.7        -ro     srcserv:/source/sunos5.7 
nfs             -ro     bigguy:/source/nfs_internals </pre></blockquote>

You've decided to add Linux, BSD, FreeBSD, and System V sources
to this map, and you have multiple versions of each. Rather than
having a map of contain entries called <em class="emphasis">sunos5.6, sunos5.7,
linux1.0, linux2.0, bsd4.3, bsd4.4, sysVr3, sysVr4,</em> etc.,
you decide that you want a hierarchy that branches first on the name
of the operating system and then on the release. So you change
<em class="emphasis">auto_source</em> to:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd             -fstype=autofs         auto_bsd
linux           -fstype=autofs         auto_linux
nfs             -ro                    bigguy:/source/nfs_internals
sunos           -fstype=atofs          auto_sunos
sysv            -fstype=atofs          auto_sysv</pre></blockquote>

The <em class="emphasis">auto_bsd</em> map might contain:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">4.1c        -ro     ancient:/export/source/bsd4.1c
4.2         -ro     ancient:/export/source/bsd4.2
4.3         -ro     ancient:/export/source/bsd4.3
4.4         -ro     srcsrv:/source/bsd4.4</pre></blockquote>

This should be enough to get the idea; for brevity, we won't
expand on what the other maps might look like.
</p>

Note that the <em class="emphasis">auto_source</em> map example contains
both entries with <em class="emphasis">fstype=autofs</em>, and an
<em class="emphasis">nfs</em> entry referring to
<em class="emphasis">bigguy:/source/nfs_internals.</em>
</p>

By the way, you probably will want to leave the
<em class="emphasis">-hosts</em> and <em class="emphasis">auto_home</em> maps at
<em class="emphasis">/net</em> and <em class="emphasis">/home</em>. The reason
is that lots of software assumes<a name="INDEX-1497" /> <a name="INDEX-1498" /> <a name="INDEX-1499" /> these mount points exist. So you would
want <em class="emphasis">auto_master</em> to look like:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Directory     Map             Mount Options
/auto           auto_auto
/home           auto_home       -nobrowse
/net            -hosts          -nobrowse
/-              auto_direct</pre></blockquote>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-9-SECT-5.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.5. Executable indirect maps</h3>

The <em class="emphasis">autofs</em> automounter contains another
<a name="INDEX-1500" />
<a name="INDEX-1501" /> <a name="INDEX-1502" />feature
known as executable maps. If permissions on an indirect map file are
marked as executable, then the <em class="emphasis">autofs</em>
automounter assumes it is an executable program or shell script, and
executes it, passing the key as the first and only argument to the
program or script. The program or script must then display an
indirect map entry, which can be hierarchal. For example, suppose
<em class="emphasis">/etc/auto_master</em> has:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Directory     Map             Mount Options
/auto           auto_auto
/home           auto_home       -nobrowse
/net            -hosts          -nobrowse
/net2           /etc/auto_exec
/-              auto_direct</pre></blockquote>

Examine <em class="emphasis">/etc/auto_exec</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ls -l /etc/auto_exe</b></tt>c
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root      sys         76 Oct 26 09:58 /etc/auto_exec
% <tt class="userinput"><b>cat /etc/auto_exe</b></tt>c
#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/showmount -e $1 | \
awk 'NR &gt; 1 {print $1       "'$1':"$1 " \\"}' | sort</pre></blockquote>

This script takes the key value as if it is a hostname, and asks the
NFS server, via the <em class="emphasis">showmount</em> command, which
filesystems are exported. The output of
<em class="emphasis">showmount</em> is then formatted by the
<em class="emphasis">awk</em> command to produce a hierarchical map entry.
You can test the script manually by doing:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% /etc/auto_exec foo
/export1        foo:/export1 \
/export2        foo:/export2 \</pre></blockquote>

Thus, the script implements functionality similar to
<em class="emphasis">/net</em>, with one difference. Note that the
<em class="emphasis">-nobrowse</em> mount option isn't included in
the <em class="emphasis">/net2</em> entry of
<em class="emphasis">auto_master</em>. This is because executable maps
can't be browsed. There doesn't seem to be any reason why
the enhanced <em class="emphasis">autofs</em> automounter couldn't
have been implemented to support it, perhaps by having a
<em class="emphasis">browse=</em> option that referred to yet another
program or script to do the browsing.
</p>

If, for some reason, the executable program or script cannot resolve
the key to a map entry, then it should display zero bytes of output
to standard output. Any output displayed to standard error will be
logged by the automounter onto the <a name="INDEX-1503" />system console.
<a name="INDEX-1504" />
<a name="INDEX-1505" />
<a name="INDEX-1506" />
</p>



<a name="ch09-13-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b> 
Make sure that if you have an automounter map file with the
executable permission bit set that you actually want it to be
executed.
</p>
