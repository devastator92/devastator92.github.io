Distributed computing architectures rely on a well-conditioned
network and properly configured servers for their adequate
performance and operation. NFS and NIS client performance degrades if
your network is congested or your servers are unreliable.
Retransmitted requests add to the noise level on the network or to
the request backlog on the server, generally exacerbating any
performance problems.</p><p>


Whenever you make a change, you run the risk of affecting more than
just one machine. If you add a new NFS client, for example, you
should consider all possible impacts on the computing environment:
network bandwidth consumed by traffic to and from this node, or the
incremental workload imposed on any servers used by the client.
Similarly, when upgrading server resources you must identify those
areas that are the tightest constraints: CPU speed, disk speed, or
aggregate disk space. Adding another server to a network may not be
as economical or beneficial as upgrading to faster disks, adding CPUs
to an expandable server or offloading other tasks, such as web
service to another host.</p><p>


This portion of the book focuses on network analysis, debugging, and
performance tuning. Its goal is to present the tools, procedures, and
evaluation criteria used for analyzing network, NFS, or NIS problems.
In addition to tuning and administration, these techniques can be
used to evaluate proposals for expanding an existing network with
additional clients or servers. Symptoms and causes of common problems
will be examined in detail, but the overall focus is on developing
techniques to be used on complex problems peculiar to your specific
combination of hardware and software.</p><p>


In this chapter, we present tools for examining the configuration and
performance of individual network components, starting at the lowest
level of basic point-to-point connectivity and working up to the RPC
layer where the NFS- and NIS-specific issues come into play. The
chapter includes examples relevant to problem diagnosis to define the
methods for collecting and interpreting data about the network and
its components. A healthy network is essential to the proper behavior
of NFS and NIS. Developing network diagnostic skills is necessary for
resolving problems that may only be apparent at the application
level. NFS may behave poorly because of a saturated network or due to
an overloaded server; a thorough examination of the problem requires
checking each component involved. If you fail to understand the
low-level operation of a facility, you are more likely to
misinterpret performance or usage statistics provided for that
facility. We cover the lower layers of the network protocols in
detail so that you can see how they affect the performance and
behavior of the application layer protocols like NFS and NIS.</p><p>


As explained in <a href="ch02_03.html#nfs2-CHP-2-SECT-3">Section 2.3, "Name service switch"</a>, NIS and DNS can be used
concurrently to resolve hostnames on the same system, although
throughout the remainder of this book, we assume that NIS is the only
name service running. In some cases, we refer to local files that are
used without NIS. However, examples and discussions refer to the most
common NIS maps, as shown in <a href="ch13_01.html#nfs2-CHP-13-TABLE-1">Table 13-1</a>.</p><p>

The <em class="emphasis">/etc/inet/ipnodes</em> file and
<em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em> NIS map form a database that associates
the names of nodes with their IP addresses. The IP addresses can be
either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. The <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em>
database was <a name="INDEX-1943" /></a>introduced in Solaris 8 to support
IPv6-aware<a href="#FOOTNOTE-25">[25]</a>
and IPv6-enabled<a href="#FOOTNOTE-26">[26]</a> applications
that need to obtain IPv6 addresses. When these applications need IPv4
addresses, they first consult the <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em>
database. If the address is not found, they then consult the
traditional <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database.
IPv6-unaware<a href="#FOOTNOTE-27">[27]</a> applications simply
consult the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database, as they are unaware
of IPv6 extensions. Although not a requirement, IPv4 addresses
defined in the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database should be copied
to the <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em> database in order to prevent
delays in name resolution, and to keep the
<em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em> and <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database
in sync.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-25" /></a>[25]IPv6-aware applications can communicate
with nodes that do not have an IPv4 address. This means that the
application can handle the larger IPv6 addresses.</p><p>

</blockquote><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-26" /></a>[26]IPv6-enabled applications take
advantage of some IPv6-specific feature. The enabled applications can
still operate over IPv4, though in a degraded mode. IPv6-enabled
applications are also IPv6-aware.</p><p>

</blockquote><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-27" /></a>[27]IPv6-unaware applications cannot handle
IPv6 addresses; therefore, they cannot communicate with nodes that do

Throughout this chapter we assume that your system is
<a name="INDEX-1944" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1945" /></a>capable of using both IPv4 and IPv6, and
uses the <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em> database to obtain IP address
mappings. If your system does not support IPv6 yet, then replace
references to the <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em> database with the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database. To reiterate, an unsuccessful
lookup of an IPv4 address in the <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em>
database implies a subsequent lookup of the same address in the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> database.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">13.1. Broadcast addresses</h2>


Many network problems stem from <a name="INDEX-1946" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1947" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1948" /></a>confusion or inconsistency in the
way hosts form their IP broadcast addresses. Broadcast addresses are
used when a packet must be sent to all machines on the local area
network. For example, if your host needs to send a packet to another
machine, it must know the remote machine's IP address and
Ethernet address. It can determine the remote IP address by looking
up the remote hostname in the NIS <em class="emphasis">ipnodes</em> map,
but it may not have the corresponding Ethernet address. If this is
the first time your machine is talking to this particular remote
host, it won't have had an opportunity to locate or save the
remote Ethernet address. The way to
determine<a name="INDEX-1949" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1950" /></a>
the remote machine's Ethernet address is to ask all of the
hosts on the network if they have the information, using the Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP). To
<a name="INDEX-1951" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1952" /></a>broadcast this request to
all hosts on the network, your host uses a special kind of
destination address called a broadcast address. A normal (or unicast)
address identifies <a name="INDEX-1953" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1954" /></a>only
one host; a broadcast address identifies all hosts on the network.</p><p>


To be an effective broadcast, the packet must reach all nodes on the
local area network and be recognized as a broadcast packet by them.
An improperly formed broadcast address, or one that other systems do
not recognize as such, can be responsible for failures ranging from
NIS clients that cannot find servers to storms of broadcast packets
initiated by a single packet sent with the wrong broadcast address.</p><p>


Like host addresses, broadcast addresses<a name="INDEX-1955" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1956" /></a> exist in both the MAC and IPv4
layers of the protocol stack. There are no broadcast addresses in
IPv6; their function is superseded by multicast addresses.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-28">[28]</a> An IPv4 broadcast
address is converted into a MAC broadcast address, just as a
host-specific IP address is converted into a 48-bit Ethernet address.
At the MAC layer, there is exactly one broadcast address; for
Ethernet it is:</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-28" /></a>[28]Multicast addresses are used to define subgroups of recipients
of data. If a sender needs to contact a large number of hosts
simultaneously, the sender can multicast a single message to all
hosts listening on the given multicast address, instead of issuing
multiple copies of the same message to every single host. The hosts
listening on the multicast address do not need to be part of the same
subnetwork as the sender.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote><pre class="code">ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</pre></blockquote>


Every node on the local network receives a packet having this
destination MAC address. A host may ignore a broadcast if the request
is for a service that it does not provide. A host processes every
broadcast packet, at the very least deciding to discard it.
Therefore, a high level of broadcast traffic hurts the performance of
each host on the network.</p><p>


While the MAC layer broadcast address is very clearly defined, there
is some variation in the form of IPv4 broadcast addresses. There are
two distinct popular forms, mostly due to evolution of the networking
code in Berkeley-based Unix systems.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-29">[29]</a> Examples of
broadcast addresses of each form are shown for each IPv4 address
class in <a href="ch13_01.html#nfs2-CHP-13-TABLE-2">Table 13-2</a>. IPv4 address classes are
described in <a href="ch01_03.html#nfs2-CHP-1-SECT-3.3">Section 1.3.3, "IPv4 address classes"</a>.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-29" /></a>[29]The 4.2 BSD
release of Unix introduced TCP/IP and required use of the zeros form
of broadcast addresses. All derivatives of 4.2 BSD, including SunOS
3.x and early versions of Ultrix, retained this broadcast address
requirement. In 4.3 BSD, the ones form of broadcast addresses was
adopted, although the zeros form was still supported. Unix operating
systems that are descendants of 4.3 BSD  --  SunOS 4.x included
 --  support both one- and zero-filled broadcast addresses.
Solaris supports only the ones form.</p><p>

The ones form is the most widely accepted and is used in all examples
in this book. Octets of the IPv4 address that specify the host number
are filled in with 1-valued bits. A variation on the ones form is the
zeros form, in which the host number is expressed as zero-valued
octets. The all-ones form:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">255.255.255.255</pre></blockquote>


is a variation of the proper ones form address where the 255-valued
octets occupy only the host number portion of the address.</p><p>


Confusion regarding the "proper" broadcast address stems
from the interpretation of octet values 0 and 255 in IPv4 addresses.
Zero-valued octets should be used as place holders when specifying a
network number and imply "this" network, without any real
implication for host numbers. For example, 129.7.0.0 means
<em class="emphasis">network number</em> 129.7., but it does not
necessarily name any hosts on the network.</p><p>


Conversely, the one-filled octets are treated like wildcards and
imply "any" host on the network. The network number is
specified but the host number matches all hosts on that network.
Using these connotations for octet values 0 and 255, the ones form of
the broadcast address is "correct." There are cases in
which the zeros form must be used for backwards compatibility with
older operating system releases. Many systems were built using the
zeros form of broadcast addresses.</p><p>


The sole requirement in adopting a broadcast address form is to make
the choice consistent across all machines on the network and
compatible with your vendor's supported convention. Machines
that expect a zeros-form broadcast address interpret a one-filled
octet as part of a host number rather than a wildcard. Mixing
broadcast address forms on the same network is the most common cause
of broadcast storms, in which every confused node on the network
transmits and retransmits replies to a broadcast address of a form
complementary to the one it is using.</p><p>


Broadcast addresses, muticast addresses, IP addresses, and other
characteristics of the Ethernet interface are set with the
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em> utility. Because
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em> governs the lowest level interface of a
node to the network, it is the logical place <a name="INDEX-1957" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1958" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1959" /></a>to begin the
discussion of network tools.</p><p>
