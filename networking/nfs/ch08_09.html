<h2 class="sect1">8.9. Client/server ratios</h2>

The number of clients that can be supported <a name="INDEX-1373" /> <a name="INDEX-1374" />from a single server depends on many
variables: the type of work done on each client, the type of disks
and network interfaces on the server, the number of clients on the
network, and the configuration of the clients. Diskless clients used
in a software engineering shop do not have the same server
requirements as diskless machines used to run the documentation
group. Similarly, when dozens of diskless clients are put onto the
same physical network, the network itself becomes a bottleneck before
the server does. Instead of adopting a somewhat arbitrary
client-server ratio, use the following steps to calculate
a<a name="INDEX-1375" />
rough client-server distribution:
</p>

<ol><li>
Set up a diskless or dataless client on a network with its own
server. Put home directories, applications, tools, and other
NFS-mounted filesystems on another server, so that the server under
test does nothing but handle root and swap filesystem requests from
the client. Use only one client for this test so that the server does
not become a bottleneck: you want to measure the load imposed by a
single client in an unconstrained environment.
</p>
</li><li>
Run a normal workload on the client, using scripts or a live user to
produce a typical traffic pattern. On the server, measure the average
traffic generated (over the course of several hours) and also try to
measure the peak request rates produced by the client. Use the
<em class="emphasis">nfsstat</em> utility on the server to determine the
number of NFS requests per second that the server handles.
<em class="emphasis">nfsstat</em> is described in more detail in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "NFS Diagnostic Tools"</a>. 
</p>
</li><li>
Repeat the first two steps for each "type" of client or
user: diskless client, dataless client, development engineer,
testing/quality assurance lab, documentation writer, and so on. Blend
these figures together based on the percentage of each client type to
determine the average NFS load imposed by all of the clients.
</p>
</li><li>
Tune and benchmark the server using the methodologies described in
<a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "Network Performance Analysis"</a>. The benchmarks should produce an
expected upper bound on the number of NFS operations that the server
can provide.
</p>
</li><li>
Divide the server's capacity by the weighted average of the
client request rates to determine a coarse client-server ratio.
Conversely, you can multiply the weighted number of NFS operations
performed by each client by the number of clients to set a goal for
the server tuning process.
</p>
</li></ol>
The ratio produced in this manner should be used as a coarse estimate
only. The client-server ratio will be overstated because each
diskless client server may handle other responsibilities, such as
serving other NFS filesystems or driving printers. It may also be
understated, because it is rare to find an environment in which the
average load produced by <em class="emphasis">N</em> hosts is
<em class="emphasis">N</em> times the load produced by a single host.
Desktop users simply aren't that synchronized. We'll take
closer looks at server and <a name="INDEX-1376" /> <a name="INDEX-1377" />client tuning, NFS benchmarking, and
performance optimization in later chapters.
