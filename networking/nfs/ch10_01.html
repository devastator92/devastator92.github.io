PC/NFS refers to an implementation <a name="INDEX-1519" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1520" /></a>of the NFS protocol for
IBM-compatible personal computers running the Windows or NT operating
systems. Originally, NFS implementations for the IBM-compatible PC
were confined to the client-side of NFS. Today, most vendors of
PC/NFS offer both a client and server, though they are often packaged
and sold separately. This chapter is confined to PC/NFS clients, and
where it uses the term "PC/NFS" the term "PC/NFS
client" is meant.</p><p>


Using PC/NFS, PC machines can mount NFS filesystems as logical disks
and use them as large virtual disks. Note that a client-only
implementation does not limit the direction or types of file transfer
operations that are possible within PC/NFS. It simply means that the
PC is always the active entity in the Windows-NFS server
relationship; the user must mount an NFS filesystem on the PC and
then copy files between it and the local disk. In this chapter,
we'll look at why you would want to use PC/NFS, alternatives to
PC/NFS, setting up PC/NFS, and PC/NFS usage issues.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-10-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">10.1. PC/NFS today</h2>


The first NFS client for Microsoft DOS or Windows operating
<a name="INDEX-1521" /></a>systems was developed by Sun Microsystems
in the mid-1980s and was called "PC/NFS." The PC/NFS
brand name has become a generic term to refer to any product that
provides an NFS client feature on Microsoft operating systems. Today,
Sun Microsystems has abandoned the PC/NFS business, leaving a fairly
competitive field of several vendors of commercial PC/NFS products.
There are also some freeware or shareware clients if you look hard
enough, but there does not appear to be much development activity
around them.</p><p>


It is beyond the scope of this book to provide a detailed survey of
PC/NFS implementations, since they each have unique features, and new
releases for each arrive all the time. You can use Internet search
engines, Usenet archives from sources like
<em class="emphasis">google.com</em>, and as a last resort, queries to
Usenet's <em class="emphasis">comp.protocols.nfs</em> newsgroup to
get<a name="INDEX-1522" /></a> feedback on what products people prefer.
You can also look at www.connectathon.org to see
<a name="INDEX-1523" /></a>which companies test products at the annual
Connectathon interoperability testing event. While the Connnectathon
web site won't tell you which companies test NFS and which of
those have PC/NFS clients, the list of companies is not too long, so
you could go to the web site of each and see which have PC/NFS
implementations.</p><p>


When selecting a PC/NFS implementation, your minimum set of required
features should include all of the
<a name="INDEX-1524" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1525" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1526" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1527" /></a>following:</p><p>


<ul><li>NFS Versions 2 and 3</p><p></li><li>NFS over UDP and TCP<p></p></li><li>Some integration with Unix authorization<p></p></li></ul>
The last feature amounts to allowing users of PC/NFS clients to use
the same password to access the NFS server as they would if they were
logging into the system the NFS server resides on. Some PC/NFS
clients accomplish this by acting as an NIS client to access the
password database from NIS. Most will also integrate by the use of
the PCNFSD protocol. This was a protocol invented by Sun Microsystems
to facilitate access to Unix password database authorization, as well
as printers connected to Unix systems. Note that while support for
this protocol is common among PC/NFS implementations, finding a
PCNFSD server is not always easy. Ironically, even as of Solaris 8,
Solaris doesn't include one. You should expect that the vendor
of your selected PC/NFS client can provide a PCNFSD server for the
Unix server platform you have deployed. If you have trouble, you
might poke around the PC/NFS vendors websites. For example,
Hummingbird's ftp.hcl.com FTP server has
source and binaries for<a name="INDEX-1528" /></a> its HCLNFSD protocol. Note that the HCLNFSD
protocol is similar in functionality to the PCNFSD protocol, but has
been enhanced to work better with the Hummingbird PC/NFS product.
HCLNFSD is not compatible with the PCNFSD protocol. While several
non-Hummingbird PC/NFS implementations support HCLNFSD in addition to
Hummingbird, if you have a PC/NFS client that supports only the
PCNFSD protocol, Hummingbird's HCLNFSD implementation will be
of no use. If you are in this predicament, try using a search engine
to find PCNFSD source code or binaries. For example, typing this
query into www.google.com:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">source code for pcnfsd</pre></blockquote>


turned up this URL:</p><p>


<blockquote class="simplelist">

<a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/programlist.html">http://www.sunfreeware.com/programlist.html</a></p><p>

</blockquote>


which had both source and binaries (Solaris 2.6, SPARC) for PCNFSD.
Obviously, URLs come and go, so don't be surprised if you find
PCNFSD somewhere else.</p><p>


Advanced and interesting features of <a name="INDEX-1529" /></a>some PC/NFS implementations include:</p><p>


<ul><li>Kerberos V5 security for NFS mounts. This allows clients to access
NFS servers that share filesystems via Kerberos V5 security only.</p><p></li><li>RPC/DH security for NFS mounts. This allows clients to access NFS
servers that share filesystems via RPC/DH security only.</p><p></li><li>Integration with NIS+.<p></p></li></ul>
You should expect that future PC/NFS implementations <a name="INDEX-1530" /></a>will add features
<a name="INDEX-1531" /></a>like NFS
Version 4 and integration with LDAP (so that the Unix authentication
<a name="INDEX-1532" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1533" /></a>database
in LDAP can be accessed).</p><p>
