The Network Information Service (NIS) and Network File System (NFS)
are services that allow you to build distributed computing systems
that are both consistent in their appearance and transparent in the
way files and data are shared.</p><p>


NIS provides a distributed database system for
<a name="INDEX-22" /></a> <a name="INDEX-23" /></a>common
configuration files. NIS servers manage copies of the database files,
and NIS clients request information from the servers instead of using
their own, local copies of these files. For example, the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> file is managed by NIS. A few NIS
servers manage copies of <a name="INDEX-24" /></a>the information
in the hosts file, and all NIS clients ask these servers for host
address information instead of looking in their own
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> file. Once NIS is running, it is no
longer necessary to manage every <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> file
on every machine in the network  --  simply updating the NIS
servers ensures that all machines will be able to retrieve the new
configuraton file information.</p><p>


NFS is a distributed filesystem. An NFS server has
<a name="INDEX-25" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-26" /></a>one
or more filesystems that are mounted by NFS clients; to the NFS
clients, the remote disks look like local disks. NFS filesystems are
mounted using the standard Unix <em class="emphasis">mount</em> command,
and all Unix utilities work just as well with NFS-mounted files as
they do with files on local disks. NFS makes system administration
easier because it eliminates the need to maintain multiple copies of
files on several machines: all NFS clients share a single copy of the
file on the NFS server. NFS also makes life easier for users: instead
of logging on to many different systems and moving files from one
system to another, a user can stay on one system and access all the
files that he or she needs within one consistent file tree.</p><p>


This book contains detailed descriptions of these services, including
configuration information, network design and planning
considerations, and debugging, tuning, and analysis tips. If you are
going to be installing a new network, expanding or fixing an existing
network, or looking for mechanisms to manage data in a distributed
environment, you should find this book helpful.</p><p>


Many people consider NFS to be the heart of a distributed computing
environment, because it manages the resource users are most concerned
about: their files. However, a distributed filesystem such as NFS
will not function properly if
<a name="INDEX-27" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-28" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-29" /></a>hosts
cannot agree on configuration information such as usernames and host
addresses. The primary function of NIS is managing configuration
information and making it consistent on all machines in the network.
NIS provides the framework in which to use NFS. Once the framework is
in place, you add users and their files into it, knowing that
essential configuration information is available to every host.
Therefore, we will look at directory services and NIS first (in
<a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Introduction to Directory Services "</a> through <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "System Management Using NIS"</a>); we'll follow that with a discussion of
NFS in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Living with Multiple Directory Servers "</a> through <a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, "Network Diagnostic and Administrative Tools"</a>.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-1-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">1.1. Networking overview</h2>


Before discussing either NFS, or NIS, we'll provide a
<a name="INDEX-30" /></a>brief
overview of network services.</p><p>


NFS and NIS are high-level networking protocols, built on several
lower-level protocols. In order to understand the way the high-level
protocols function, you need to know how the underlying services
work. The lower-level network protocols are quite complex, and
several books have been written about them without even touching on
NFS and NIS services. Therefore, this chapter contains only a brief
outline of the network services used by NFS and NIS.</p><p>


Network protocols are typically
<a name="INDEX-31" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-32" /></a>described in terms of a layered model, in
which the protocols are "stacked" on top of each other.
Data coming into a machine is passed from the lowest-level protocol
up to the highest, and data sent to other hosts moves down the
protocol stack. The layered model is a useful
<a name="INDEX-33" /></a>description because it allows
network services to be defined in terms of their functions, rather
than their specific implementations. New protocols can be substituted
at lower levels without affecting the higher-level protocols, as long
as these new protocols behave in the same manner as those that were
replaced.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-34" /></a>The standard model
for networking protocols and distributed<a name="INDEX-35" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-36" /></a> applications is the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) seven-layer
model shown in <a href="ch01_01.html#nfs2-CHP-1-TABLE-1">Table 1-1</a>.</p><p>

Purists will note that the TCP/IP protocols do
<a name="INDEX-37" /></a>not precisely<a name="INDEX-38" /></a> fit the
specifications for the services in the ISO model. The functions
performed by each layer, however, correspond very closely to the
functions of each part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, and provide a
good framework for visualizing how the various protocols fit
together.</p>


The lower levels have a well-defined job to do, and the higher levels
rely on them to perform it independently of the particular medium or
implementation. While TCP/IP most frequently is run over Ethernet, it
can <a name="INDEX-39" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-40" /></a>also be used
<a name="INDEX-41" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-42" /></a>with a synchronous serial line or fiber
optic network. Different implementations of the first two network
layers are used, but the higher-level protocols are unchanged.
Consider an NFS server that uses all six lower protocol layers: it
has no knowledge of the physical cabling connecting it to its
clients. The server just worries about its NFS protocols and counts
on the lower layers to do their job as well.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-43" /></a>Throughout
this book, the <em class="emphasis">network stack</em> or
<em class="emphasis">protocol stack</em> refers to
<a name="INDEX-44" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-45" /></a>this layering
<a name="INDEX-46" /></a>of
<a name="INDEX-47" /></a>services.
<em class="emphasis">Layer</em> or <em class="emphasis">level</em> will refer
to<a name="INDEX-48" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-49" /></a> one specific
part of the stack and its relationship to its upper and lower
neighbors. Understanding the basic structure of the network services
on which NFS and NIS are built is essential for designing and
configuring large networks, as well as debugging problems. A failure
or overly tight constraint in a lower-level protocol affects the
operation of all protocols above it. If the physical network cannot
handle the load placed on it by all of the desktop workstations and
servers, then NFS and NIS will not function properly. Even though NFS
or NIS will appear "broken," the real issue is with a
lower level in the network stack.</p><p>


The following sections briefly describe the function of each layer
and the mapping of NFS and NIS into them. Many books have been
written about the ISO seven-layer model, TCP/IP, and Ethernet, so
their treatment here is intentionally light. If you find <a name="INDEX-50" /></a>this discussion of
networking fundamentals too basic, feel free to skip over this
chapter.</p><p>
