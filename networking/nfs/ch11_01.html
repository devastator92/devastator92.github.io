In <a href="ch07_05.html#nfs2-CHP-7-SECT-5">Section 7.5, "File locking"</a>, we introduced the concept of file
locking and the two primary components: the RPC lock daemon and the
status monitor. This chapter will delve more deeply into file locking
and will examine the administrative aspects.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">11.1. What is file locking? </h2>

File locking is the act of ensuring that when <a name="INDEX-1575" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1576" /></a>you access
a file, usually via a software application, no one can change the
file until you are done examining it. If you want to modify the file,
then file locking ensures that no one else can examine or modify the
file until you are done modifying it.
</p><p>

The earliest versions of Unix had no way to lock files except to
create lock files. The idea is that two or more processes would more
or less simultaneously try to create a lock file in exclusive mode,
via the O_EXCL flag of the <em class="emphasis">open</em>( ) system call.
The <a name="INDEX-1577" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1578" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1579" /></a>operating system would return success to
the process that won the race, and a "file exists" error
to losing processes. One problem with this scheme is that it relies
on the winning process to remove the lock file before it exits. If
the process is running buggy software, this might not happen. Some
applications mitigate this problem by recording the process ID of the
winner into the contents of the lock file. A process that finds that
it gets a "file exists" error can then read the lock file
to see if the owning process is still running.
</p><p>

Still, lock files can be clumsy. In the 1980s, Unix versions were
released with file locking support built into the operating system.
The System V branch of Unix offered file locking via the
<em class="emphasis">fcntl</em>( ) system call, whereas the BSD branch
<a name="INDEX-1580" /></a>provided the flock( ) system call. In
both cases, when the process that creates the lock dies, the lock
will be automatically released.
</p><p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.1. Exclusive and shared locks</h3>

Both <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> and <em class="emphasis">flock</em> give
the choice of either an exclusive lock, where only one process could
hold the lock, or a shared lock, where multiple holders could
simultaneously exist, to the exclusion of holders of the exclusive
lock. The exclusive lock is sometimes called a "single
writer" lock, because its exclusive nature lends itself to
allowing safe writes to a file. The shared lock is sometimes called a
"multiple readers" lock because its shared nature lends
itself to allowing multiple safe reads of a file.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.2. Record locks</h3>

The <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> system call also has
the<a name="INDEX-1581" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1582" /></a> feature of byte range record locking.
This means that the application can partition a file into as many
arbitrarily sized segments or records that it wants, and by
specifying a file offset and length, lock them. Thus, it is possible
to have both an exclusive lock and a shared lock on a file, provided
the file offsets and lengths of each record lock do not overlap.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-11-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.3. Mandatory versus advisory locking</h3>

Both <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> and <em class="emphasis">flock</em> offer
<em class="emphasis">advisory</em> locking. Advisory locking <a name="INDEX-1583" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1584" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1585" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1586" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1587" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1588" /></a>is
locking that requires the cooperation of participating processes.
Suppose process A acquires an exclusive lock on the file, with the
intent to write it. Suppose process B opens the file with the intent
to write it. If process B fails to acquire a lock, there is nothing
to prevent it from issuing a write system call and corrupting the
process that A is writing. For this reason, advisory locking is
<a name="INDEX-1589" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1590" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1591" /></a>sometimes called
<em class="emphasis">unenforced</em> locking.
</p><p>

System V (and therefore Solaris) offers
<em class="emphasis">mandatory</em> or <em class="emphasis">enforced</em>
locking as an option. This option is enabled if mandatory lock
permissions are set on a file. Mandatory lock permissions are an
overload of the set group ID execution bit (02000 in octal). If the
set group ID execution bit is set, and if the group execution bit is
not set, then all reads and writes to the file will use enforced
locking. So, for example:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% chmod 2644 example
% ls -l example
-rw-r-lr--   1 mre      staff            9 Dec 28 10:52 example</pre></blockquote>

This makes file <em class="emphasis">example</em> readable and writable by
the file's owner, and readable by everyone else. The appearance
of the l in the first field of the output of the
<em class="emphasis">ls</em> command tells you that mandatory locking is
enabled. Of course, you can use any combination of read or write
permissions for the file's owner, group, and world.
</p><p>

If the mandatory lock permissions are set on a file, then every
<em class="emphasis">write( )</em> or <em class="emphasis">read( )</em> system
call results in an implicit sequence of:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">fcntl(...); /* lock the file at the range we are reading or writing */
read(...); /* or */ write(...);
fcntl(...); /* unlock the file at the range locked above */</pre></blockquote>

What if the process has already acquired a lock by an explicit
<em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> call? If the range locked is equal to or
encompasses the range the read or write is done on, then no implicit
pair of <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> calls are done. If the range
explicitly locked partly overlaps the range read or write will do,
then implicit fcntl calls are done on the unlocked portion of the
range.
</p><p>

Mandatory locking seems very useful, but it is open to denial of
service attacks. Suppose mandatory lock permissions are set on a
file. An attacker named Mallet decides to issue an
<em class="emphasis">fcntl</em> call to get an exclusive lock on the
entire file. Bob now tries to read the file and finds that his
application hangs. A proponent of mandatory locking might point out
that the mistake was in allowing the file to be accessible by Mallet
(if Mallet can't open the file, he can't lock it). The
counter argument is that if you are going to rely on permissions to
avoid a denial of service (and restricted permissions are a good
thing to have for critical applications), then the set of users who
can access the file is limited to those with a vested interest in
avoiding denial of service. In that case, mandatory <a name="INDEX-1592" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1593" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1594" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1595" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1596" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1597" /></a>locking is no more
useful than advisory locking.

<h3 class="sect2">11.1.4. Windows/NT locking scheme</h3>

The discussion so far has been about Unix
locking<a name="INDEX-1598" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1599" /></a>
paradigms. The Windows world has a different paradigm. There are two
major differences between Unix and Windows locking:
</p><p>

<ul><li>
The first difference is that the Windows world supports a share
reservation programming interface. Share reservations apply to the
entire file and are specified at the time a file is created or
opened. A share reservation consists of a pair of modes. The first is
the access mode, which is how the application will access the file:
read, write, or read/write. The second is the access that the
application will deny to other applications: none, read, write, or
read/write. When the application attempts to open a file, the
operating system checks to see if there are any other open requests
on the file. If so, it first compares the application's access
mode with the deny mode of the other openers. If there is a match,
then the open is denied. If not, then the operating system compares
the application's deny mode with the access mode of the other
openers. Again, if there is a match, the open is denied.
</p><p>
</li><li>
The second difference is that there is no advisory locking. Whole
file locking, byte range locking, and share reservation<a name="INDEX-1600" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1601" /></a> locking are all
mandatory or enforced.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-18">[18]</a>
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-18" /></a>[18]As it turns out, very few
Windows programs rely on byte range mandatory locking.</p><p>
</blockquote>
</li></ul>

<a name="ch11-8-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>TIP: </b> 
Share reservations in the Windows world do not interact at all with
Windows byte range or whole file locking.
