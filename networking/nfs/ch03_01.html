A major problem in running a distributed computing environment is
maintaining separate copies of common configuration files such as the
password, group, and hosts files. Ideally, the network should be
consistent in its configuration, so that users don't have to
worry about where they have accounts or if they'll be able to
find a new machine on the network. Preserving consistency, however,
means that every change to one of these common files must be
propagated to every host on the network. In a small network, this
might not be a major chore, but in a computing environment with
hundreds or thousands of systems, simple administrative tasks can
turn into all-day projects. Furthermore, without an automated tool
for making changes, the probability of making mistakes grows with the
size of the network and the number of places where changes must be
made.</p><p>


The Network Information System (NIS) addresses
<a name="INDEX-320" /></a> <a name="INDEX-321" /></a>these
problems. It is a distributed database system that replaces copies of
commonly replicated configuration files with a centralized management
facility. Instead of having to manage each host's files (like
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em>, <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/group</em>, <em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em>,
and so on), you maintain one database for each file on one central
server. Machines that are using NIS retrieve information as needed
from these databases. If you add a new system to the network, you can
modify one file on a central server and propagate this change to the
rest of the network, rather than changing the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file for each individual host on the
network. For a network of two or three systems, the difference may
not be crucial; but for a large network with hundreds of systems, NIS
is life-saving.</p><p>


Because NIS enforces consistent views of files on the network, it is
suited for files that have no host-specific information in them. The
<em class="emphasis">/etc/vfstab</em> file of filesystems
<a name="INDEX-322" /></a>and
mount points, for example, is a terrible candidate for management by
NIS because it's different on just about every machine. Files
that are generally the same on all hosts in a network, such as
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> and <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em>,
fit the NIS model of a distributed database nicely.</p><p>


In addition to managing configuration files, NIS can be used for any
general data file that is accessed on one or more key fields. In a
later chapter, we will discuss how to use NIS to manage your own
site-specific databases.</p><p>


This discussion of networking services starts with NIS because it
provides the consistency that is a prerequisite for the successful
administration of a distributed filesystem. Imagine a network in
which you share files from a common server, but you have a different
home directory and user ID value on every host. The advantages of the
shared filesystem are lost in such a loosely run network: you
can't always read or write your files due to permission
problems, and you don't get a consistent view of your files
between machines because you don't always end up in the same
home directory. We'll start with a brief description of the
different roles systems play under NIS, and then look at how to
install NIS on each type of machine.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-3-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">3.1. Masters, slaves, and clients</h2>


NIS is built on the client-server
model.<a name="INDEX-323" /></a><a name="INDEX-324" /></a> An NIS server is a host
that contains NIS data files, called
<em class="emphasis">maps</em>.<a name="INDEX-325" /></a>
Clients are hosts that
<a name="INDEX-326" /></a> <a name="INDEX-327" /></a> <a name="INDEX-328" /></a>request information from these maps.
Servers are further divided into master and slave servers: the master
server is the true single owner of the map data. Slave NIS servers
handle client requests, but they do not modify the NIS maps. The
master server is responsible for all map maintenance and distribution
to its slave servers. Once an NIS map is built on the master to
include a change, the new map file is distributed to all slave
servers. NIS clients "see" these changes when they
perform queries on the map file  --  it doesn't matter
whether the clients are talking to a master or a slave server,
because once the map data is distributed, all NIS servers have the
same information.</p><p>


Before going any further, let's take a quick and simple look at
how this works. <a href="ch03_01.html#nfs2-CHP-3-FIG-1">Figure 3-1</a> shows the relationship
between masters, slaves, and clients.</p><p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-3-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="277" alt="Figure 3-1" src="figs/nfs2.0301.gif" width="441" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-1. NIS masters, slaves, and clients</h4>

Consider the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> NIS map,
<a name="INDEX-329" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-330" /></a>which replaces the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> files on<a name="INDEX-331" /></a>
individual systems. If you're familiar with Unix adminstration,
you know that this file tells the system how to convert hostnames
into IP (internet) addresses. When a client needs to look up the
internet address of some system, it would normally read the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file. If NIS is running, however, the
client bypasses its <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file,
and<a name="INDEX-332" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-333" /></a> instead asks an NIS server (either
a master or a slave server  --  it doesn't make any
difference) for the information it needs.</p><p>


Now the other side of the coin: you've added a system, and need
to modify the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> NIS map. You only modify
<a name="INDEX-334" /></a> <a name="INDEX-335" /></a>the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file
on the "master server"  --  remember, the master
server knows the "truth" about the network.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a> Once you've made your
changes, you can rebuild the NIS database (i.e., the NIS maps) on the
master server. The master server then distributes new versions of the
NIS maps to the slave servers, which now provide the updated
information to the NIS clients.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-4" /></a>[4]Remember: when you want to make a global change to the network,
<a name="INDEX-336" /></a> <a name="INDEX-337" /></a>you must modify the file on the master
server. Global changes made to slave servers or clients will, at
best, be ignored.</p><p>

</blockquote>


With the distinction between NIS servers and clients firmly
established, we can see that each system fits into the NIS scheme in
one of three ways:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>Client only</i></dt>
<dd>This is typical of <a name="INDEX-338" /></a> <a name="INDEX-339" /></a>desktop workstations, where the system
administrator tries to minimize the amount of host-specific tailoring
required to bring a system onto the network. As an NIS client, the
host gets all of its common configuration information from an extant
server.</p><p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Server only</i></dt>
<dd>While the host services client requests <a name="INDEX-340" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-341" /></a>for map information, it does not use NIS
for its own operation. Server-only configuration may be useful when a
server must provide global host and password information for the NIS
clients, but security concerns prohibit the server from using these
same files. However, bypassing the central configuration scheme opens
some of the same loopholes that NIS was intended to close. Although
it is possible to configure a system to be an NIS server only, we
don't recommend it and don't cover it in this book.</p><p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Client and server</i></dt>
<dd>In most cases, an NIS server also <a name="INDEX-342" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-343" /></a>functions
as an NIS client so that its management is streamlined with that of
other client-only hosts.</p><p></dd>

</dl>


It is possible to limit the
<a name="INDEX-344" /></a>scope of NIS to a few files that are
changed infrequently, such as the <em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em>
file, but doing so defeats the purpose of using NIS and greatly
increases the cost of network management. Once NIS is running, it
will be used by all system library functions that refer to maps
(files) under NIS control. As mentioned in <a href="ch02_03.html#nfs2-CHP-2-SECT-3">Section 2.3, "Name service switch"</a> it is possible to configure a client to get
map or file information for a particular database from either NIS,
files, or both.</p><p>


Now that we have this client-server model for the major
administrative files, we need a way to discuss where and when a
particular set of files applies to a given host. It is much too
simple-minded for a single set of files to apply to every host on a
network; a reasonable system must support different clusters of
systems with different administrative requirements. For example, a
group of administrative systems and a group of research systems might
share the same network. In most cases, these two clusters of systems
don't need to share the same administrative information. In
some cases, sharing the same administrative files might be harmful.</p><p>


To allow an administrator to set different
<a name="INDEX-345" /></a>policies for different systems, NIS
provides the concept of a <em class="emphasis">domain.</em> Most
precisely,
<a name="INDEX-346" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-347" /></a><a name="INDEX-348" /></a>a domain is a
set of NIS maps. A client can refer to a map (for example, the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> map) from any of several different
domains. Most of the time, however, any given host will only look up
data from one set of NIS maps. Therefore, it's common (although
not precisely correct) to use the term "domain" to mean
"the group of systems that share a set of NIS maps." All
systems that need to share common configuration information are put
into an NIS domain. Although each system can potentially look up
information in any NIS domain, each system is assigned to a
"default domain," meaning that the system, by default,
looks up information from a particular set of NIS maps. In our
example, the research systems would, by default, look at the maps
<a name="INDEX-349" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-350" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-351" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-352" /></a>in
the <em class="emphasis">research</em> domain, rather than the maps from
the <em class="emphasis">accounting</em> domain; and so on.</p><p>


It is up to the administrator (or administrators) to decide how many
different domains are needed. In <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "System Management Using NIS"</a>, we
will give some rules-of-thumb for deciding how many domains are
needed. Lest you think this is terribly complex, we'll tell you
now: many networks, possibly even most small networks, can get by
with a single domain. We will also take a closer look at the precise
definition of an NIS domain.</p><p>
