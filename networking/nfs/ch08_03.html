<h2 class="sect1">8.3. Diskless client boot process</h2>

Debugging any sort of diskless client <a name="INDEX-1256" />
<a name="INDEX-1257" />problems requires some
knowledge of the boot process. When a diskless client is powered on,
it knows almost nothing about its configuration. It doesn't
know its hostname, since that's established in the boot scripts
that it hasn't run yet. It has no concept of IP addresses,
because it has no hosts file or hosts NIS map to read. The only piece
of information it knows for certain is its 48-bit Ethernet address,
which is in the hardware on the CPU (or Ethernet interface) board. To
be able to boot, a diskless client must convert the 48-bit Ethernet
address into more useful information such as a boot server name, a
hostname, an IP address, and the location of its root and swap
filesystems.
</p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-8-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.1. Reverse ARP requests</h3>

The heart of the boot process is mapping 48-bit Ethernet
<a name="INDEX-1258" />
<a name="INDEX-1259" />addresses to IP
addresses. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to locate a
48-bit Ethernet address for a known IP address. Its inverse, Reverse
ARP (or RARP), is used by
<a name="INDEX-1260" />
<a name="INDEX-1261" />diskless clients to find
their IP addresses given their Ethernet addresses.
Servers<a name="INDEX-1262" />
<a name="INDEX-1263" />
run the <em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> daemon to accept and process RARP
requests, which are broadcast on the network by diskless clients
attempting to boot.
</p>

IP addresses are calculated in two steps. The 48-bit Ethernet address
<a name="INDEX-1264" />
<a name="INDEX-1265" />received in the RARP is used as a
key in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em> file or
<em class="emphasis">ethers</em> NIS map. <em class="emphasis">rarpd</em>
locates the hostname associated with the Ethernet address from the
<em class="emphasis">ethers</em> database and uses that name as a key into
the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> map to find the appropriate IP
address.
</p>

For the <em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> daemon to operate correctly, it
must <a name="INDEX-1266" />
<a name="INDEX-1267" />be
able to get packets from the raw network interface. RARP packets are
not <a name="INDEX-1268" /> <a name="INDEX-1269" />
<a name="INDEX-1270" />
<a name="INDEX-1271" />passed up through the TCP or UDP layers of
the protocol stack, so <em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> listens directly on
each network interface (e.g., hme0) device node for RARP requests.
Make sure that all boot servers are running
<em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> before examining other possible points of
failure. The best way to check is with <em class="emphasis">ps</em>, which
should show the <em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> process:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>ps -eaf | grep rarpd</b></tt>
    root   274     1  0   Apr 16 ?        0:00 /usr/sbin/in.rarpd -a</pre></blockquote>

Some implementations of <em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> are multithreaded,
and some will fork child processes. Solaris
<em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> implementations will create a process or
thread for each network interface the server has, plus one extra
process or thread. The purpose of the extra thread or child process
is to act as a delayed responder. Sometimes,
<em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> gets a request but decides to delay its
response by passing the request to the delayed responder, which waits
a few seconds before sending the response. A per-interface
<em class="emphasis">rarpd</em> thread/process chooses to send a delayed
response if it decides it is not the best candidate to answer the
request. To understand how this decision is made, we need to look at
the process of converting Ethernet addresses into IP addresses in
more <a name="INDEX-1272" />
<a name="INDEX-1273" />detail.
</p>

The client broadcasts a RARP request containing its 48-bit Ethernet
address and waits for a reply. Using the <em class="emphasis">ethers</em>
and <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> maps, any <em class="emphasis">RARP</em>
server <a name="INDEX-1274" /> <a name="INDEX-1275" />receiving the request attempts to match it
to an IP address for the client. Before sending the reply to the
client, the server verifies that it is the best candidate to boot the
client by checking the <em class="emphasis">/tftpboot</em> directory (more
on this soon). If the server has the client's boot parameters
but might not be able to boot the client, it delays sending a reply
(by giving the request to the delayed responder daemon) so that the
correct server replies first. Because RARP requests are broadcast,
they are received and processed in somewhat random order by all boot
servers on the network. The reply delay compensates for the time skew
in reply generation. The server that thinks it can boot the diskless
client immediately sends its reply to the client; other machines may
also send their replies a short time later.
</p>

You may ask "Why should a host other than the client's
boot server answer its RARP request?" After all, if the boot
server is down, the diskless client won't be able to boot even
if it does have a hostname and IP address. The primary reason is that
the "real" boot server may be very loaded, and it may not
respond to the RARP request before the diskless client times out.
Allowing other hosts to answer the broadcast prevents the client from
getting locked into a cycle of sending a RARP request, timing out,
and sending the request again. A related reason for having multiple
RARP replies is that the RARP packet may be missed by the
client's boot server. This is functionally equivalent to the
server not replying to the RARP request promptly: if some host does
not provide the correct answer, the client continues to broadcast
RARP packets until its boot server is less heavily loaded. Finally,
RARP is used for other network services as well as for booting
diskless clients, so RARP servers must be able to reply to RARP
requests whether they are diskless client boot servers or not.
</p>

After receiving any one of the RARP replies, the client knows its IP
address, as well as the IP address of a boot server (found by looking
in the packet returned by the server). In some implementations, a
diskless client announces its IP addresses with a message of the
form:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Using IP address 192.9.200.1 = C009C801</pre></blockquote>

A valid IP address is only the first step in booting; the client
needs to be able to load the boot code if it wants to eventually get
a Unix kernel running.
</p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-8-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.2. Getting a boot block</h3>

A local and remote IP address are all that are needed to<a name="INDEX-1276" />
<a name="INDEX-1277" />
download the boot block using a simple file transfer program
<a name="INDEX-1278" /> <a name="INDEX-1279" />called
<em class="emphasis">tftp</em> (for trivial <em class="emphasis">ftp</em>).
This minimal file transfer utility does no user or password checking
and is small enough to fit in the boot PROM. Downloading a boot block
to the client is done from the server's
<em class="emphasis">/tftpboot</em> directory.
</p>

The server has no specific knowledge of the architecture of the
client issuing a RARP or <em class="emphasis">tftp</em> request. It also
needs a mechanism for determining if it can boot the client, using
only its IP address  --  the first piece of information the client
can discern. The server's <em class="emphasis">/tftpboot</em>
directory contains boot blocks for each architecture of
<a name="INDEX-1280" /> <a name="INDEX-1281" />client support, and a set of symbolic
links that point to these boot blocks:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[wahoo]% <tt class="userinput"><b> ls -l /tftpboot</b></tt>
total 282
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root    26 Feb 17 12:43 828D0E09 -&gt; inetboot.sun4u.Solaris_2.7
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root    26 Feb 17 12:43 828D0E09.SUN4U -&gt; inetboot.sun4u.Solaris_2.7
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root    26 Apr 27 18:14 828D0E0A -&gt; inetboot.sun4u.Solaris_2.7
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root    26 Apr 27 18:14 828D0E0A.SUN4U -&gt; inetboot.sun4u.Solaris_2.7
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 129632 Feb 17 12:21 inetboot.sun4u.Solaris_2.7 
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      1 Feb 17 12:17 tftpboot -&gt; .</pre></blockquote>

The link names are the IP addresses of the clients in hexadecimal.
The first client link  --  <em class="emphasis">828D0E09</em>  -- 
corresponds to IP address 130.141.14.9:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">828D0E09 
<i class="lineannotation">Insert dots to put in IP address format: </i>
82.8D.0E.09 
<i class="lineannotation">Convert back to decimal: </i>
130.141.14.9</pre></blockquote>

Two links exist for each client  --  one with the IP address in
hexadecimal, and one with the IP address and the machine
architecture. The second
<a name="INDEX-1282" />link is used by
some versions of <em class="emphasis">tftpboot</em> that specify their
architecture when asking for a boot block. It doesn't hurt to
have both, as long as they point to the correct boot block for the
client.
</p>

The previous section stated that a server delays its response to a
RARP request if it doesn't think it's the best candidate
to boot the requesting client. The server makes this determination by
matching the client IP address to a link in
<em class="emphasis">/tftpboot</em>. If the link exists, the server is the
best candidate to boot the client; if the link is missing, the server
delays its response to allow another server to reply first.
</p>

The client gets its boot block via <em class="emphasis">tftp</em>, sending
its request to the server that answered its RARP request. When the
<em class="emphasis">inetd</em> daemon on the server receives the
<em class="emphasis">tftp</em> request, it starts an
<em class="emphasis">in.tftpd</em> daemon that locates the right boot file
by following the symbolic link representing the client's IP
address. The <em class="emphasis">tftpd</em> daemon downloads the boot
file to the client. In some implementations, when the client gets a
valid boot file, it reports the address of its boot server:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Booting from tftp server at 130.141.14.2 = 828D0E02</pre></blockquote>

It's possible that the first host to reply to the
client's RARP request can't boot it  --  it may have
had valid <em class="emphasis">ethers</em> and <em class="emphasis">hosts</em>
map entries for the machine but not a boot file. If the first server
chosen by the diskless client does not answer the
<em class="emphasis">tftp</em> request, the client broadcasts this same
request. If no server responds, the machine complains that it cannot
find a <em class="emphasis">tftp</em> server.
</p>

The <em class="emphasis">tftpd</em> daemon should be run in secure mode
using the <em class="emphasis">-s</em> option. This is usually the default
configuration in its <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> entry:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tftp dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/in.tftpd in.tftpd -s /tftpboot</pre></blockquote>

The argument after the <em class="emphasis">-s</em> is the directory that
<em class="emphasis">tftp</em> uses as its root  --  it does a
<em class="emphasis">chdir</em>( ) into this directory and then a
<em class="emphasis">chroot</em>( ) to make it the root of the filesystem
visible to the <em class="emphasis">tftp</em> process. This measure
prevents <em class="emphasis">tftp</em> from being used to take any file
other than a boot block in <em class="emphasis">tftpboot</em>.
</p>

The last directory entry in <em class="emphasis">/tftpboot</em> is a
symbolic link to itself, using the current directory entry
(<tt class="literal">.</tt>) instead of its full pathname. This symbolic
link is used for compatibility with older systems that passed a full
pathname to <em class="emphasis">tftp</em>, such as
<em class="emphasis">/tftpboot/C009C801.SUN4U</em>. Following the symbolic
link effectively removes the <em class="emphasis">/tftpboot</em> component
and allows a secure <em class="emphasis">tftp</em> to find the request
file in its root directory. Do not remove this symbolic link, or
older diskless clients will not be able to download<a name="INDEX-1283" /> <a name="INDEX-1284" /> their <a name="INDEX-1285" /> <a name="INDEX-1286" />boot files.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-8-SECT-3.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.3. Booting a kernel</h3>

Once the boot file is loaded, the <a name="INDEX-1287" /> <a name="INDEX-1288" /> <a name="INDEX-1289" />diskless client jumps out of its PROM
monitor<a name="INDEX-1290" /> and into the boot code. To do
anything useful, <em class="emphasis">boot</em> needs a root and swap
filesystem, preferably with a bootable kernel on the root device. To
get this information, <em class="emphasis">boot</em> broadcasts a request
for boot parameters. The <em class="emphasis">bootparamd</em> RPC
server<a name="INDEX-1291" />
listens for these requests and returns a gift pack filled with the
location of the root filesystem, the client's hostname, and the
name of the boot server. The filesystem information is kept in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/bootparams</em> or in the NIS
<em class="emphasis">bootparams</em> map.
</p>

The diskless client mounts its root filesystem
<a name="INDEX-1292" />
<a name="INDEX-1293" />from the
named boot server and boots the kernel image found there. After
configuring root and swap devices, the client begins single user
startup and sets its hostname, IP addresses, and NIS domain name from
information in its <em class="emphasis">/etc</em> files. It is imperative
that the names and addresses returned by
<em class="emphasis">bootparamd</em> match those in the client's
configuration files, which must also match the contents of the NIS
maps.
</p>

As part of the single user boot, the client mounts its
<em class="emphasis">/usr</em> filesystem from the server listed in its
<em class="emphasis">/etc/vfstab</em> file. At this point, the client has
root and swap filesystems, and looks (to the Unix kernel) no
different than a system booting from a local disk. The diskless
client executes its boot script files, and eventually enters
multi-user mode and displays a login prompt. Any breakdowns that
occur after the <em class="emphasis">/usr</em> filesystem is mounted are
caused by problems in the boot scripts, not in the diskless client
boot<a name="INDEX-1294" />
<a name="INDEX-1295" />
<a name="INDEX-1296" /> process
itself.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-8-SECT-3.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.4. Managing boot parameters</h3>

Every diskless client boot server <a name="INDEX-1297" /> <a name="INDEX-1298" />
<a name="INDEX-1299" />has an
<em class="emphasis">/etc/bootparams</em> file and/or uses a
<em class="emphasis">bootparams</em> NIS map. On Solaris, the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/nsswitch.conf</em> file's bootparams entry
controls whether the information is read from
<em class="emphasis">/etc/bootparams</em>, NIS, or both, and in what
order.
</p>

Here are some suggestions for managing diskless client boot
parameters:
</p>

<ul><li>
Keep the boot parameters in the <em class="emphasis">bootparams</em> map
if you are using NIS. Obviously, if your NIS master server is also a
diskless client server, it will contain a complete
<em class="emphasis">/etc/bootparams</em> file.
</p>
</li><li>
If you have diskless clients in more than one NIS domain, make sure
you have a separate NIS <em class="emphasis">bootparams</em> map for each
domain.
</p>
</li><li>
On networks with diskless clients from different vendors, make sure
that the format of the boot parameter information used by each vendor
is the same. If one system's <em class="emphasis">bootparamd</em>
daemon returns a boot parameter packet that cannot be understood by
another system, you will not be able to use the NIS
<em class="emphasis">bootparams</em> map. We'll look at the problems
caused by differing boot parameter packet formats in <a href="ch15_03.html#nfs2-CHP-15-SECT-3">Section 15.3, "Boot parameter confusion"</a>.
</p>
</li></ul>
Eliminating copies of the boot parameter information on the other
servers reduces the chances that you'll have out-of-date
information on <a name="INDEX-1300" /> <a name="INDEX-1301" />boot servers <a name="INDEX-1302" /> <a name="INDEX-1303" /> <a name="INDEX-1304" />after you've
made a configuration change.
