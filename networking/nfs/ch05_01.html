<h2 class="sect1">5.1. Domain name servers</h2>

The hostname management provided by NIS
<a name="INDEX-742" /></a>can
<a name="INDEX-743" /></a>be integrated with an
Internet Domain Name Service (DNS), or the DNS facilities can be used
to replace the NIS host map in its entirety. We'll avoid a
full-length discussion of setting up a name server. That process
depends on the type of name server supported by your vendor, and it
is best described by your vendor's documentation. Instead, this
section concentrates on differences between the scope of the two
hostname services, and support for DNS with and without NIS. Note
that the implementation of Domain name services provided by your
vendor may not be called DNS. If the Berkeley Internet Name Domain
name service or one of its derivatives is used, the service is often
called BIND.
</p><p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-5-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.1. DNS versus NIS</h3>

DNS provides a hierarchical hostname <a name="INDEX-744" /></a>management system that spans the
entire Internet. Each level in the hierarchy designates authoritative
name servers that contain maps of hostnames and IP addresses, similar
to the NIS hosts map but on a larger scale. The DNS server for a
large name service domain would have host information merged from
dozens of NIS domains. First among the advantages of DNS is its
ability to decentralize responsibility for the maintenance of
hostname-to-IP address mappings and the resulting domain name
qualification that is used to differentiate identically named hosts.
</p><p>

Decentralized name management means
<a name="INDEX-745" /></a> <a name="INDEX-746" /></a>that each organization running a
name service domain  --  whether it is a subdivision of a
corporation or an entire company  --  can maintain its own host
information without having to notify some central authority of
changes in its local configuration. Host information is published
through the authoritative name server for that domain, and hosts in
other name service domains retrieve information from the name server
when needed. Every domain knows how to reach the next highest level
in the name space hierarchy, and it can generally find most of its
peer name servers within the same organization. If a name server does
not know how to reach the name server for another domain, it can ask
the next higher level domain name server for assistance.
</p><p>

For example, Princeton University is part of the educational, or
<em class="emphasis">.edu,</em> domain. The
<a name="INDEX-747" /></a> <a name="INDEX-748" /></a>domain name for the entire university is
<em class="emphasis">princeton.edu</em>, and it is further divided by
department:
</p><p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

cs.princeton.edu </p><p>

politics.princeton.edu </p><p>

history.princeton.edu</p><p>

</blockquote>

and so on. Each of the name servers for the departmental name service
domains knows how to reach most of the others; therefore each
department can run its own systems without having to notify a
campus-wide network manager of any changes to host information. There
is also a name server for the entire
<em class="emphasis">princeton.edu</em> domain that points to lower-level
name servers for incoming queries and locates other domains in
<em class="emphasis">.edu</em>, <em class="emphasis">.com</em>, or
<em class="emphasis">.gov</em> for outbound requests.
</p><p>

In a world in which every machine name must be unique, all of the
good names are taken very quickly. DNS allows each domain to have a
distinct name space, so that two domains may have hosts with the same
name: the name service domain suffix distinguishes them on a higher
level in the hierarchy. This is a job that cannot be performed by
NIS, since the concatenation of <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> files
from several different domains would result in hostname clashes. If
the NIS domains are left independent, there is no global naming
authority, because NIS lacks a mechanism for cross-domain <a name="INDEX-749" /></a>hostname queries.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-5-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.2. DNS integration with NIS</h3>

Hostnames are managed <a name="INDEX-750" /></a> <a name="INDEX-751" /></a>in a hierarchy. Each host manages
its own name, so the hosts are the "leaf nodes" in this
management tree. Hosts are grouped together into NIS or DNS domains,
creating a two-level tree. DNS domains may be further grouped
together by company, department, or physical location, adding more
levels to the management hierarchy. NIS fits into the DNS management
scheme at the lowest level in this hierarchy.
</p><p>

Within a single DNS domain, there may be many physical networks with
several system administrators. NIS provides a system for the
independent management of these small networks; NIS host map
information can be combined to form the DNS host file. The approaches
for doing this are described in <a href="ch05_02.html#nfs2-CHP-5-SECT-2">Section 5.2, "Implementation"</a> later in this chapter.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-5-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.3. NIS and DNS domain names</h3>

If an Internet DNS is used in conjunction <a name="INDEX-752" /></a> <a name="INDEX-753" /></a> <a name="INDEX-754" /></a>with
NIS, it is helpful to tie the NIS domain names to the DNS domain
name. Deriving NIS
domain<a name="INDEX-755" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-756" /></a> names
from the DNS domain name links the two management schemes: the
DNS-derived portion of the NIS domain name indicates where the NIS
domain looks for its hostname information. Joining NIS and DNS domain
names also makes sense if you have a single DNS domain that spans
several physical locations. Each office will have its own networks,
and its own NIS domains, so using the DNS domain name in the NIS
domain name indicates how these locations fit into the "big
picture."
</p><p>

For example, the Polygon Company uses the DNS domain name
<em class="emphasis">polygon.com</em>. It has four NIS domains in its main
office, which uses the <em class="emphasis">polygon.com</em> DNS domain
name. The NIS domain names use the DNS domain name as a suffix:
</p><p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

bos-engin.polygon.com </p><p>

philly-engin.polygon.com </p><p>

finance.polygon.com </p><p>

sales.polygon.com</p><p>

</blockquote>

If NIS is set up as the primary directory service, then Solaris
versions of <em class="emphasis">sendmail</em> assume that an NIS domain
name was derived from a DNS domain name, and they will strip the
first component to derive the mail domain name. That is, if your NIS
domain name is <em class="emphasis">bos-engin.polygon.com</em>, then
<em class="emphasis">sendmail</em> uses <em class="emphasis">polygon.com</em>
as your mail domain name by default. There may be many NIS domains in
this DNS domain; <em class="emphasis">sendmail</em> strips off the leading
component to form the DNS domain name.
</p><p>

However, if there are multiple NIS domains within the DNS domain
 --  several sales offices in different cities, for example
 --  then the NIS domain names should reflect the subdivision of
the DNS domain, as shown in <a href="ch05_01.html#nfs2-CHP-5-TABLE-1">Table 5-1</a>.
</p><p>

<a name="nfs2-CHP-5-TABLE-1" /></a><h4 class="objtitle">Table 5-1. Subdividing a DNS domain into NIS domains </h4><table border="1">



<tr>
<th>
NIS Domain</p><p>
</th>
<th>

</th>
</tr>


<tr>

boston.sales.polygon.com</p><p>

</table><p>

Because the NIS domain name contains four dot-separated components,
<em class="emphasis">sendmail</em> drops the first component and uses the
remainder as a DNS domain name. This allows all of the sales offices
to be treated as a single administrative unit for mail and hostname
management, even though they require distinct NIS domains.
</p>

It is important to note that each single administrative unit, whether
it is implemented with one NIS domain or multiple NIS domains must
share the same map entries. Thus, all the hosts listed in the hosts
map of <em class="emphasis">waltham.engin.polygon.com</em> must be listed
in the hosts map of <em class="emphasis">alameda.engin.polygon.com</em>.
The converse must be true as well. Getting all hosts to agree on
usernames, <em class="emphasis">uid/gid</em> values, and host addresses is
a<a name="INDEX-757" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-758" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-759" /></a>
prerequisite for adding other distributed services such as the
Network File System.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nfs2-CHP-5-SECT-1.4" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.4. Domain aliases</h3>

Some systems impose a fairly small limit on the length <a name="INDEX-760" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-761" /></a>of a domain name. If you've chosen
a long NIS domain name, say
<em class="emphasis">nesales.East.Sun.COM</em>, then implementations of
NIS that restrict the length of a domain name will not be able to
bind to a server.
</p><p>

You could build a second NIS domain with a shorter name and duplicate
the maps from the first domain, but this leaves you with twice the
administrative work. An easier solution to this problem is to create
a domain name alias for the longer name by making a symbolic link in
the NIS server directory <em class="emphasis">/var/yp</em> on each server
host:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">master# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/yp</b></tt> 
master# <tt class="userinput"><b>ln -s nesales.East.Sun.COM nesales</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

NIS servers in the fully qualified domain respond to requests for
service for the truncated domain name because they believe they have
a set of maps for the specified domain. It is of no consequence that
the "directory" is really a link to another
domain's directory. This trick can also be used to force two
distinct NIS domains to share exactly the same set of maps.
</p><p>

In a simple network, your domain names are likely to be short and
easily managed. However, if you integrate DNS with NIS, and choose
NIS domain names based on name service domains, you may end up with
long, multicomponent names such as
<em class="emphasis">grad.history.princeton.edu</em>. Using symbolic links
to create <a name="INDEX-762" /></a> <a name="INDEX-763" /></a>aliases for long names may be necessary
to make all of your NIS clients find NIS servers.
