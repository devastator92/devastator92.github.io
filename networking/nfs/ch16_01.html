Performance analysis and tuning, particularly when it <a name="INDEX-2380" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2381" /></a>involves
NFS and NIS, is a topic subject to heated debate. The focus of the
next three chapters is on the analysis techniques and configuration
options used to identify performance bottlenecks and improve overall
system response time. Tuning a network and its servers is similar to
optimizing a piece of user-written code. Finding the obvious flaws
and correcting poor programming habits generally leads to marked
improvements in performance. Similarly, there is a definite and
noticeable difference between networked systems with abysmal
performance and those that run reasonably well; those with poor
response generally suffer from "poor habits" in network
resource use or configuration. It's easy to justify spending
the time to eliminate major flaws when the return on your time
investment is so large.
</p><p>

However, all tuning processes are subject to a law of diminishing
returns. Getting the last 5-10% out of an application usually means
hand-rolling loops or reading assembly language listings. Fine-tuning
a network server to an "optimum" configuration may yield
that last bit of performance, but the next network change or new
client added to the system may make performance of the finely tuned
system worse than that of an untuned system. If other aspects of the
computing environment are neglected as a result of the incremental
server tuning, then the benefits of fine-tuning certainly do not
justify its costs.
</p><p>

Our approach will be to make things "close enough for
jazz." Folklore has it that jazz musicians take their
instruments from their cases, and if all of the keys, strings, and
valves look functional, they start playing music. Fine-tuning
instruments is frowned upon, especially when the ambient street noise
masks its effects. Simply ensuring that network and server
performance are acceptable  --  and remain consistently acceptable
in the face of network changes  --  is often a realistic goal for
the tuning process.
</p><p>

As a network manager, you are also faced with the task of balancing
the demands of individual users against the global constraints of the
network and its resources. Users have a local view: they always want
their machines to run faster, but the global view of the system
administrator must be to tune the network to meet the aggregate
demands of all users. There are no constraints in NFS or NIS that
keep a client from using more than its fair share of network
resources, so NFS and NIS tuning requires that you optimize both the
servers and the ways in which the clients use these
servers.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-43">[43]</a>

bandwidth on specified ports, allowing you to restrict the amount of

Management</em> book published by Sun Microsystems Press

<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-16-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">16.1. Characterization of NFS behavior</h2>

You must be able to characterize<a name="INDEX-2383" /></a> the
demands placed on your servers as well as available configuration
options before starting the tuning process. You'll need to know
the quantities that you can adjust, and the mechanisms used to
measure the success of any particular change. Above all else, it
helps to understand the general behavior of a facility before you
begin to measure it. In the first part of this book, we have examined
individual NFS and NIS requests, but haven't really looked at
how they are generated in "live" environments.
</p><p>

NFS requests exhibit randomness
<a name="INDEX-2384" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2385" /></a>in
two ways: they are typically generated in bursts, and the types of
requests in each burst usually don't have anything to do with
each other. It is very rare to have a steady, equally spaced stream
of requests arriving at any server. The typical NFS request
generation pattern involves a burst of requests as a user loads an
application from an NFS server into memory or when the application
reads or writes a file. These bursts are followed by quiet periods
when the user is editing, thinking, or eating lunch. In addition, the
requests from one client are rarely coordinated with those from
another; one user may be reading mail while another is building
software. Consecutive NFS requests received by a server are likely to
perform different functions on different parts of one or more disks.
</p><p>

NFS traffic volumes also vary
<a name="INDEX-2386" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2387" /></a>somewhat
predictably over the course of a day. In the early morning, many
users read their mail, placing <a name="INDEX-2388" /></a>a heavier load on a central mail server; at
the end of the day most file servers will be loaded as users wrap up
their work for the day and write out modified files. Perhaps the most
obvious case of time-dependent server usage is a student lab. The
hours after class and after dinner are likely to be the busiest for
the lab servers, since that's when most people gravitate toward
the lab.
</p><p>

Simply knowing the sheer volume of requests won't help you
characterize your NFS work load. It's easy to provide
"tremendous" NFS performance if only a few requests
require disk accesses. Requests vary greatly in the server resources
they need to be completed. "Big" RPC requests force the
server to read or write from disk. In addition to the obvious NFS
read and write requests, some symbolic link resolutions require
reading information from disk. "Small" NFS RPC requests
simply touch file attribute information, or the directory name
look-up cache, and can usually be satisfied without a disk access if
the server has previously cached the attribute information.
</p><p>

The average percentage of all RPC calls of <a name="INDEX-2389" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2390" /></a>each type is the
"NFS RPC mixture," and it defines the
<em class="emphasis">kind</em> of work the server is being asked to do, as
opposed to simply the volume of work presented to it. The RPC mixture
indicates possible areas of improvement, or flags obvious
bottlenecks. It is important to determine if your environment is
data- or attribute-intensive, since this will likely dictate the
network utilization and the type of tuning required on the client and
server.
</p><p>

A data-intensive environment is one in which large file transfers
dominate the NFS traffic. Transfers are considered large if
<a name="INDEX-2391" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2392" /></a>the size of the files is over
100 MB. Examples of these environments include computer aided design
and image processing. An attribute-intensive environment, on the
other hand, is dominated by small file and meta-data access. The NFS
clients mostly generate traffic to obtain directory contents, file
attributes, and the data contents of small files. For example, in a
software development environment, engineers edit relatively small
source files, header files, and makefiles. The compilation and
linkage process involves a large number of attribute checks that
verify the modification time of the files to decide when new object
files need to be rebuilt, resulting in multiple frequent small file
reads and writes. Because of their nature, attribute-intensive
environments will benefit greatly from aggressive caching of
name-lookup information on the server, and a reduced network
collision rate. On the other hand, a high-bandwidth network and a
fast server with fast disks will most benefit data-intensive
applications due to their dependence on data access. Studies have
shown that most environments are attribute intensive. Once you have
characterized your NFS workload, you will <a name="INDEX-2393" /></a>need to know how to
measure server performance as seen by NFS clients.
