<h2 class="sect1">6.6. Naming schemes</h2>

Simple, efficient naming schemes make<a name="INDEX-976" /> <a name="INDEX-977" />
the difference between a filesystem that is well organized and a
pleasure to use, and a filesystem that you are constantly fighting
against. In this section, we'll look at ways of using mount
points and symbolic links to create simple, consistent naming schemes
on all NFS clients. NFS provides the mechanism for making distributed
filesystems transparent to the user, but it has no inherent
guidelines for creating easy to use and easier to manage filesystem
hierarchies. There are few global rules, and each network will adopt
conventions based on the number of servers, the kinds of files
handled by those servers, and any peculiar naming requirements of
locally developed or third-party software.
</p>

Note that this section assumes that you will not be
using<a name="INDEX-978" /> the automounter (see <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "The Automounter"</a>). It is strongly advised that you
<em class="emphasis">do</em> use the automounter, because every issue
mentioned and solved here is much more easily solved with the
automounter.
</p>

As a system administrator, you should first decide how the various
NFS fileservers fit together on a client before assigning filesystem
names and filling them with software or users. Here are some ideas
and suggestions for choosing NFS naming schemes:
</p>

<ul><li>
Avoid having NFS mounts on directories directly under the root (/ )
directory of each NFS client. The reason is that if an NFS server
crashes, then any attempts to access the mounted directory will hang
the application even if it is not interested in the NFS mount point.
This can happen if an application invokes the library equivalent of
the <em class="emphasis">pwd</em> command: <em class="emphasis">getcwd( )</em>.
<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-9" />[9]The <em class="emphasis">getcwd( )</em> routine builds
its pathname of the current working directory by searching upward via
the ".." directory, and then reading each directory to
find the directory with the same file ID number as the current
working directory. To get the file ID requires invoking the
<em class="emphasis">stat( )</em> system call on the directory. If the
directory is served by an NFS server, and the server is unavailable,
then <em class="emphasis">stat( )</em>, hence <em class="emphasis">getcwd(
)</em>, and the application will hang indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
</li><li>
Pick a common directory on each client under which you will mount
each user's home directory. For example, if you pick
<em class="emphasis">/users</em>, then each user's home directory is accessed
via the <em class="emphasis">/users/username</em> naming scheme.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-10" />[10]The example uses <em class="emphasis">/users</em> and not
<em class="emphasis">/home</em>. This is because the automounter in
Solaris reserves <em class="emphasis">/home</em>. While you can modify
each Solaris client to remove the reservation, that is tedious. A
common error is for people to use <em class="emphasis">vfstab</em> or the
<em class="emphasis">mount</em> command to mount onto
<em class="emphasis">/home</em>, and if the automounter has reserved
/home, things will fail in odd ways.</p> </blockquote>

This makes it easier to deal with servers that have several
filesystems of home directories. The disadvantage to this approach is
that it requires a larger <em class="emphasis">/etc/vfstab</em> file, with
one entry for each user's home directory. If you use the NFS
automounter, this naming scheme is more easily managed than the
hostname-oriented one (and the automounter has a
<em class="emphasis">/home/username</em> scheme preconfigured).
Directories that follow any regular naming scheme are easily managed
by the automounter, as discussed in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "The Automounter"</a>.
</p>
</li><li>
Do not allow the physical location of the files on the server to
dictate the pathnames to be used on the client. For example, if the
software tools directory is on
<em class="emphasis">wahoo:/export/home/toolbox</em>, then instead of
mounting <em class="emphasis">wahoo:/export/home/toolbox</em>
ontoeachclient's <em class="emphasis">/export/home/toolbox</em>
directory, use something more user friendly, like
<em class="emphasis">/software/toolbox</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">mount wahoo:/export/home/toolbox /software/toolbox</pre></blockquote>

Normally you don't want people running applications on hosts
that are also NFS servers. However, if you allow this, and if you
want users on the NFS server to be able to access the toolbox as
/software/toolbox, then you can either create a symbolic link
from <em class="emphasis">/software/toolbox</em> to
<em class="emphasis">/export/home/toolbox</em>, or use the loopback
filesystem in Solaris to accomplish the same thing without the
overhead of a symbolic link:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">mount -F lofs /export/home/toolbox /software/toolbox</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
Keep growth in mind. Having a single third-party software filesystem
may be the most effective (or only) solution immediately, but over
the next year you may need to add a second or third filesystem to
make room for more tools. To provide adequate performance, you may
want to put each filesystem on a different server, distributing the
load. If you choose a naming scheme that cannot be extended, you will
end up renaming things later on and having to support the "old
style" names.
</p>
</li></ul>
In the third-party tools directory example, you could separate tools
into subdirectories grouped by function:
<em class="emphasis">/software/tools/epubs</em> for page composition and
publishing software, and <em class="emphasis">/software/tools/cae</em> for
engineering tools. If either directory grows enough to warrant its
own filesystem, you can move the subdirectory to a new server and
preserve the existing naming scheme by simply mounting both
subdirectories on clients:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">Before: single tools depository </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount toolbox:/export/home/tools  /software/tools</b></tt> 
 
<i class="lineannotation">After: multiple filesystems </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount toolbox:/export/home/epubs /software/tools/epubs</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount backpack:/export/home/case /software/tools/cae</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">6.6.1. Solving the /usr/local puzzle</h3>

Let's assume you have a network with many<a name="INDEX-979" /> different kinds of
workstations: SPARC workstations, PowerPC-based workstations, Unix
PCs, and so on. Of course, each kind of workstation has its own set
of executables. The executables may be built from the same source
files, but you need a different binary for each machine architecture.
How do you arrange the filesystem so that each system has a
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> directory (and, by extension,
other executable directories) that contains only the executables that
are appropriate for its architecture? How do you "hide"
the executables that aren't appropriate, so there's no
chance that a user will mistakenly try to execute them? This is the
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> puzzle: creating an
"architecture neutral" executable directory.
</p>

Implementing an architecture-neutral
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> is probably one of the first
challenges posed to the system administrator of a heterogeneous
network. Everybody wants the standard set of tools, such as emacs,
PostScript filters, mail-pretty printers, and the requisite telephone
list utility. Ideally, there should be one <em class="emphasis">bin</em>
directory for each architecture, and when a user looks in
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> on any machine, he or she should
find the proper executables. Hiding the machine architecture is a
good job for symbolic links.
</p>

One solution is to name the individual binary directories with the
machine type as a suffix and then mount the proper one on
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">On server toolbox: </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /export/home/local</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>ls</b></tt> 
bin.mips bin.sun3 bin.sun4 bin.vax 
 
<i class="lineannotation">On client: </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount toolbox:/export/home/local/bin.`arch` /usr/local/bin</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

The <em class="emphasis">mount</em> command determines the architecture of
the local host and grabs the correct binary directory from the
server.
</p>

This scheme is sufficient if you only have binaries in your local
depository, but most sites add manual pages, source code, and other
ASCII files that are shared across client architectures. There is no
need to maintain multiple copies of these files. To accommodate a
mixture of shared ASCII and binary files, use two mounts of the same
filesystem: the first mount sets up the framework of directories, and
puts the shared file directories in their proper place. The second
mount deposits the proper binary directory on top of
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><i class="lineannotation">On server toolbox: </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /export/home/local</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>ls</b></tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>bin</b></tt>
bin.mips bin.sun3 bin.sun4 bin.vax mansharesrc 
 
<i class="lineannotation">On client: </i>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount toolbox:/export/home/local /usr/local</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>mount toolbox:/export/home/local/bin.`arch` /usr/local/bin</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

At first glance, the previous example appears to violate the NFS
rules prohibiting the export of a directory and any of its
subdirectories. However, there is only one exported filesystem on
server <em class="emphasis">toolbox</em>, namely,
<em class="emphasis">/export/home</em>. The clients mount different parts
of this exported filesystem on top of one another. NFS allows a
client to mount any part of an exported filesystem, on any directory.
</p>

To save disk space with the two-mount approach, populate
<em class="emphasis">/export/home/bin</em> on the server with the proper
executables, and make the <em class="emphasis">bin.arch</em> directory a
symbolic link to <em class="emphasis">bin</em>. This allows clients of the
same architecture as the server to get by with only one mount.
</p>

If you keep <em class="emphasis">all</em> executables  --  scripts and
compiled applications  --  in the <em class="emphasis">bin</em>
directories, you still have a problem with duplication. At some
sites, scripts may account for more than half of the tools in
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em>, and having to copy them into
each architecture-specific <em class="emphasis">bin</em> directory makes
this solution less pleasing.
</p>

A more robust solution to the problem is to divide shell scripts and
executables into two directories: scripts go in
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/share</em> while compiled executables live
in the familiar <em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em>. This makes
<em class="emphasis">share</em> a peer of the
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/man</em> and <em class="emphasis">src</em>
directories, both of which contain architecture-neutral ASCII files.
To adapt to the fully architecture-neutral
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em>, users need to put both
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/share</em> in their search paths, although
this is a small price to pay for the guarantee that all tools are
accessible from all systems.
</p>

There is one problem with mounting one filesystem on top of another:
if the server for these filesystems goes down, you will not be able
to unmount them until the server recovers. When you unmount a
filesystem, it gets information about all of the directories above
it. If the filesystem is not mounted on top of another NFS
filesystem, this isn't a problem: all of the directory
information is on the NFS client. However, the hierarchy of mounts
used in the <em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> example presents a
problem. One of the directories that an unmount operation would need
to check is located on the server that crashed. An attempt to unmount
the <em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> directory will hang because
it tries to get information about the <em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em>
mount point  --  and the server for that mount point is the one
that crashed. Similarly, if you try to unmount the
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> filesystem, this attempt will fail
because the <em class="emphasis">/usr/local/bin</em> directory is in use:
it has a<a name="INDEX-980" />
<a name="INDEX-981" />
filesystem <a name="INDEX-982" /> <a name="INDEX-983" />mounted on it.
