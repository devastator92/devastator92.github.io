The previous chapter gave an overview of the ISO seven-layer model,
describing in some detail the lower layers. In this chapter, we will
discuss a class of layer 7 --  application protocols known as
directory services. NIS is an example of such a directory service.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-2-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">2.1. Purpose of directory services</h2>


The purpose of a directory service is to map <a name="INDEX-273" /></a>names of
one form to names of another form. Often the names of the first form
are alphanumeric strings, and the second form are numbers. Or the
names of the first form are simple, whereas the names of second form
are complex. In the days before computing, we used directories, but
they were published on paper. The most obvious one, and perhaps the
inspiration for network directory services, is the telephone book. A
typical telephone book for a city in the United States consists of
three directories:</p><p>


<ul><li>The white pages of residence listings</p><p></li><li>The white pages of business listings<p></p></li><li>The yellow pages of business listings<p></p></li></ul>
The residence white page listings contains a list of names, last name
first, and for each entry, the telephone number. In many cases, each
entry contains the street address of the residence. Thus you can
think of the residence white pages in a telephone book, as a way to
<em class="emphasis">direct</em> you from a person's name to his
telephone number and address. Hence, a telephone book's formal
name is a telephone <em class="emphasis">directory</em>.</p><p>


The white pages of residence listings can be thought of as a
"structured set of data." If this data were stored on a
computer, a lexicographer would call it a <em class="emphasis">database</em>
; a "structured set of data" is the definition
of <em class="emphasis">database</em> in the Concise Oxford Dictionary.
Sometimes, when you are in a hurry or don't have a telephone
number, you dial a special telephone number (411 or 555-1212 in the
United States) to ask an operator ("directory
assistance") for the telephone number of the person you want to
call. This directory assistance can be thought of as directory
service. You, the caller, are a customer or client of the directory
service, and the particular operator, is a server of the directory
service. In the world of computer networking, the human server is
replaced with a directory server of databases. Since there is a
server, there has to be a client. The client-side of a directory
service is typically a programming library which allows other
applications to look up entries in the database.</p><p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-2-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.1.1. The hosts database</h3>


We've so far described a lot of theory, but a<a name="INDEX-274" /></a> <a name="INDEX-275" /></a> concrete example of a database in
directory services should crystallize the concept.</p><p>


The metaphor of a telephone directory was useful in explaining the
concepts of directory service, client, and server. It turns out that
the concept of names of people and their telephone numbers is also a
metaphor for a similar database in computer networking. Recall from <a href="ch01_03.html#nfs2-CHP-1-SECT-3.2">Section 1.3.2, "IP host addresses"</a> that hosts have unique
numbers or addresses, just as every telephone number in the world is
unique. Just as we associate names of people with their telephone
numbers, in computer networking we often want to give individual
hosts a name in addition to a host address. The reasons are that it
is easier to remember a name than a number, and just as people move
geographically, requiring new telephone number assignments, hosts can
move physically (requiring a new address assignment for the host) or
conversely, the function the host was serving can move from one
physical host to another (requiring a new name assignment for the
host).</p><p>


The hostname and address entries are stored in a hosts database that
the directory server can use to respond to requests from clients. As
was noted earlier, the client-side of the directory service is
typically a programming library. This is the case for the hosts
database. There is a subroutine, known
<a name="INDEX-276" /></a>as
<em class="emphasis">gethostbyname( )</em> that takes a string name of a
host and returns the address of the host. See your system's
manual page for <em class="emphasis">gethostbyname</em> for the precise
calling conventions. Solaris comes with a utility called
<em class="emphasis">getent</em> for looking up database entries via the
command line. For example:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% getent hosts frostback
128.0.0.1       frostback</pre></blockquote>


<em class="emphasis">getent</em> can be thought of as one of the most
primitive directory service clients, but nearly every application
that deals with the network will be a client that needs to access the
hosts database via the directory service. A more advanced client of
the hosts database is a web browser such as Netscape Navigator or
Internet Explorer. Browsers will link to
<em class="emphasis">gethostbyname</em> or a similar interface to find the
host addresses corresponding to Universal Resource Locators (URLs,
those things that start with <em class="emphasis">http://</em> ).</p><p>


Going back to the telephone concept, sometimes we would like to know
the name of the caller corresponding to a telephone number. In the
United States, when you call a toll free number, the merchant
receiving the call has the capability to display your phone number
and can map it to your name (considering that the merchant is paying
for your long distance call, some might reason that this is fair). In
the computer networking world, it is sometimes useful to know the
hostname of the client accessing the server. For example, suppose the
server side of a web browser is a web server. Web servers often keep
logs of the "hits" made to the server, for the purposes
of understanding how popular a web site is, what is popular, and what
hosts find it popular. The web server will always be able to find the
host address of the client that made the hit. To figure out the name
of the host, there is a programming interface called
<em class="emphasis">gethostbyaddr( )</em>, which takes a host address,
and returns the name of the host. The information can be obtained
from the hosts database, via the directory service. In other words,
both servers and client of different services, in this case, web
services, can be clients of <a name="INDEX-277" /></a> <a name="INDEX-278" /></a>directory <a name="INDEX-279" /></a>services.</p><p>
