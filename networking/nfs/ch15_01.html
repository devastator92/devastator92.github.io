This chapter consists of case studies in network problem analysis and
debugging, ranging from Ethernet addressing problems to a machine
posing as an NIS server in the wrong domain. This chapter is a bridge
between the formal discussion of NFS and NIS tools and their use in
performance analysis and tuning. The case studies presented here walk
through debugging scenarios, but they should also give you an idea of
how the various tools work together.</p><p>


When debugging a network problem, it's important to think about
the potential cause of a problem, and then use that to start ruling
out other factors. For example, if your attempts to bind to an NIS
server are failing, you should know that you could try testing the
network using <em class="emphasis">ping</em>, the health of
<em class="emphasis">ypserv</em> processes
using<a name="INDEX-2327" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2328" /></a><a name="INDEX-2329" /></a><a name="INDEX-2330" /></a><a name="INDEX-2331" /></a> <em class="emphasis">rpcinfo</em>, and finally
the binding itself with <em class="emphasis">ypset</em>. Working your way
through the protocol layers ensures that you don't miss a
low-level problem that is posing as a higher-level failure. Keeping
with that advice, we'll start by looking at a network layer
problem.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="nfs2-CHP-15-SECT-1" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2332" /></a><h2 class="sect1">15.1. Duplicate ARP replies</h2>


ARP misinformation was briefly mentioned<a name="INDEX-2333" /></a> in <a href="ch13_02.html#nfs2-CHP-13-SECT-2.3">Section 13.2.3, "IP to MAC address mappings"</a>, and this story showcases some of the baffling
effects it creates. A network of two servers and ten clients suddenly
began to run very slowly, with the following symptoms:</p><p>


<ul><li>Some users attempting to start a document-processing application were
waiting ten to 30 <em class="emphasis">minutes</em> for the
application's window to appear, while those on well-behaved
machines waited a few seconds. The executables resided on a
fileserver and were NFS mounted on each client. Every machine in the
group experienced these delays over a period of a few days, although
not all at the same time.</p><p></li><li>Machines would suddenly "go away" for several minutes.
Clients would stop seeing their NFS and NIS servers, producing
streams of messages like:</p><p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">NFS server muskrat not responding still trying</pre></blockquote>


or:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ypbind: NIS server not responding for domain "techpubs"; still trying</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>

The local area network with the problems was joined to the
campus-wide backbone via a bridge. An identical network of machines,
running the same applications with nearly the same configuration, was
operating without problems on the far side of the bridge. We were
assured of the health of the physical network by two engineers who
had verified physical connections and cable routing.</p><p>


The very sporadic nature of the problem  --  and the fact that it
resolved itself over time  --  pointed toward a problem with ARP
request and reply<a name="INDEX-2334" /></a> mismatches. This
hypothesis neatly explained the extraordinarily slow loading of the
application: a client machine trying to read the application
executable would do so by issuing NFS Version 2 requests over UDP. To
send the UDP packets, the client would
ARP<a name="INDEX-2335" /></a> the server, randomly get the wrong reply,
and then be unable to use that entry for several minutes. When the
ARP table entry had aged and was deleted, the client would again ARP
the server; if the correct ARP response was received then the client
could continue reading pages of the executable. Every wrong reply
received by the client would add a few minutes to the loading time.</p><p>


There were several possible sources of the ARP confusion, so to
isolate the problem, we forced a client to ARP the server and watched
what happened to the ARP table:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>arp -d muskrat</b></tt> 
muskrat (139.50.2.1) deleted 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>ping -s muskrat</b></tt> 
PING muskrat: 56 data bytes 
<i class="lineannotation">No further output from ping</i></pre></blockquote>


By deleting the ARP table entry and then directing the client to send
packets to <em class="emphasis">muskrat</em>, we forced an ARP of
<em class="emphasis">muskrat</em> from the client.
<em class="emphasis">ping</em> timed out without receiving any ICMP echo
replies, so we examined the ARP table and found a surprise:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>arp -a | fgrep muskrat</b></tt> 
le0   muskrat               255.255.255.255       08:00:49:05:02:a9</pre></blockquote>


Since <em class="emphasis">muskrat</em> was a Sun workstation, we expected
its Ethernet address to begin with 08:00:20 (the prefix assigned to
Sun Microsystems), not the 08:00:49 prefix used by Kinetics gateway
boxes. The next step was to figure out how the wrong Ethernet address
was ending up in the ARP table: was <em class="emphasis">muskrat</em>
lying in its ARP replies, or had we found a network imposter?</p><p>


Using a network analyzer, we repeated the ARP experiment and watched
ARP replies returned. We saw two distinct replies: the correct one
from <em class="emphasis">muskrat</em>, followed by an invalid reply from
the Kinetics FastPath gateway. The root of this problem was that the
Kinetics box had been configured using the IP broadcast address
0.0.0.0, allowing it to answer all ARP requests. Reconfiguring the
Kinetics box with a non-broadcast IP address solved the problem.</p><p>


The last update to the ARP table is the one that
"sticks," so the wrong Ethernet address was overwriting
the correct ARP table entry. The Kinetics FastPath was located on the
other side of the bridge, virtually guaranteeing that its replies
would be the last to arrive, delayed by their transit over the
bridge. When <em class="emphasis">muskrat</em> was heavily loaded, it was
slow to reply to the ARP request and its ARP response would be the
last to arrive. Reconfiguring the Kinetics FastPath to use a proper
IP address and network mask cured the problem.</p><p>


ARP servers that have out-of-date information create similar
problems. This situation arises if an IP address is changed without a
corresponding update of the server's published ARP table
initialization, or if the IP address in question is re-assigned to a
machine that implements the ARP protocol. If an ARP server was
employed because <em class="emphasis">muskrat</em> could not answer ARP
requests, then we should have seen exactly one ARP reply, coming from
the ARP server. However, an ARP server with a published ARP table
entry for a machine capable of answering its own ARP requests
produces exactly the same duplicate response symptoms described
above. With both machines on the same local network, the failures
tend to be more intermittent, since there is no obvious time-ordering
of the replies.</p><p>


There's a moral to this story: you should rarely need to know
the Ethernet address of a workstation, but it does help to have them
recorded in a file or NIS map. This problem was solved with a bit of
luck, because the machine generating incorrect replies had a
different manufacturer, and therefore a different Ethernet address
prefix. If the incorrectly configured machine had been from the same
vendor, we would have had to compare the Ethernet addresses in the
ARP table with what we believed to be the correct addresses for the
machine in <a name="INDEX-2336" /></a>question.</p><p>
