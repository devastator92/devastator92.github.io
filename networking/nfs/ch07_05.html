<h2 class="sect1">7.5. File locking</h2>


File locking allows one process to gain<a name="INDEX-1163" /> <a name="INDEX-1164" />
exclusive access to a file or part of a file, and forces other
processes requiring access to the file to wait for the lock to be
released. Locking is a stateful operation and does not mesh well with
the stateless design of NFS. One of NFS's design goals is to
maintain Unix filesystem semantics on all files, which includes
supporting record locks on files.</p>


Unix locks come in two flavors: BSD-style file locks and System
V-style record locks. The BSD locking mechanism implemented in the
<em class="emphasis">flock</em>( ) system call exists for whole file
locking only, and on Solaris is implemented in terms of the more
general System V-style locks. The System V-style locks are
implemented through the <em class="emphasis">fcntl</em>( ) system call and
the <em class="emphasis">lockf</em>( ) library routine, which uses
<em class="emphasis">fcntl</em>( ). System V locking operations are
separated from the NFS protocol and handled by an RPC lock daemon and
a status monitoring daemon that recreate and verify state information
when either a client or server reboot.</p>


<a name="nfs2-CHP-7-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.5.1. Lock and status daemons</h3>


The RPC lock daemon, <em class="emphasis">lockd</em>, runs on <a name="INDEX-1165" /> <a name="INDEX-1166" />
<a name="INDEX-1167" />
<a name="INDEX-1168" />both
the client and server. When a lock request is made for an NFS-mounted
file, <em class="emphasis">lockd</em> forwards the request to the
server's <em class="emphasis">lockd</em>. The lock daemon asks the
status monitor daemon, <em class="emphasis">statd</em>, to note that the
client has requested a lock and to begin monitoring the client.</p>


The file locking daemon and status monitor daemon keep two
directories with lock "reminders" in them:
<em class="emphasis">/var/statmom/sm</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/var/statmon/sm.bak.</em> (On some systems, these
directories are <em class="emphasis">/etc/sm</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/sm.bak.</em>) The first directory is used by the
status monitor on an NFS server to track the names of hosts that have
locked one or more of its files. The files in
<em class="emphasis">/var/statmon/sm</em> are empty and are used primarily
as pointers for lock renegotiation after a server or client crash.
When <em class="emphasis">statd</em> is asked to monitor a system, it
creates a file with that system's name in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/statmon/sm</em>.</p>


If the system making the lock request must be notified of a server
reboot, then an entry is made in
<em class="emphasis">/var/statmon/sm.bak</em> as well. When the status
monitor daemon starts up, it calls the status daemon on all of the
systems whose names appear in
<em class="emphasis">/var/statmon/sm.bak</em> to notify them that the NFS
server has rebooted. Each client's status daemon tells its lock
daemon that locks may have been lost due to a server crash. The
client-side lock daemons resubmit all outstanding lock requests,
recreating the <a name="INDEX-1169" /> <a name="INDEX-1170" /> <a name="INDEX-1171" /> <a name="INDEX-1172" />file lock state (on the server) that
existed before the server crashed.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-7-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.5.2. Client lock recovery</h3>


If the server's <em class="emphasis">statd</em> cannot reach
a<a name="INDEX-1173" /> client's status daemon to
inform it of the crash recovery, it begins printing annoying messages
on the server's console:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">statd: cannot talk to statd at client, RPC: Timed out(5)</pre></blockquote>


These messages indicate that the local <em class="emphasis">statd</em>
process could not find the portmapper on the client to make an RPC
call to its status daemon. If the client has also rebooted and is not
quite back on the air, the server's status monitor should
eventually find the client and update the file lock state. However,
if the client was taken down, had its named changed, or was removed
from the network altogether, these messages continue until
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> is told to stop looking for the missing
client.</p>


To silence <em class="emphasis">statd</em>, kill the status daemon
process, remove the appropriate file in
<em class="emphasis">/var/statmon/sm.bak</em>, and restart
<em class="emphasis">statd</em>. For example, if server
<em class="emphasis">onaga</em> cannot find the <em class="emphasis">statd</em>
daemon on client <em class="emphasis">noreaster</em>, remove that
client's entry in <em class="emphasis">/var/statmon/sm.bak</em> :</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>ps -eaf | fgrep statd</b></tt> 
root   133     1  0   Jan 16 ?        0:00 /usr/lib/nfs/statd
root  8364  6300  0 06:10:27 pts/13   0:00 fgrep statd
onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>kill -9 133</b></tt> 
onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /var/statmon/sm.bak</b></tt> 
onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>ls</b></tt> 
noreaster 
onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>rm noreaster</b></tt> 
onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /</b></tt> 
onaga# <tt class="userinput"><b>/usr/lib/nfs/statd</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


Error messages from <em class="emphasis">statd</em> should be expected
whenever an NFS client is removed from the network, or when clients
and servers boot at the <a name="INDEX-1174" />same time.</p>
</div>




<a name="nfs2-CHP-7-SECT-5.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.5.3. Recreating state information</h3>


Because permanent state (state that survives crashes) is<a name="INDEX-1175" />
maintained on the server host owning the locked file, the server is
given the job of asking clients to re-establish their
<a name="INDEX-1176" />locks when state is lost. Only a server
crash removes state from the system, and it is missing state that is
impossible to regenerate without some external help.</p>


When a client reboots, it by definition has given up all of its
locks, but there is no state <em class="emphasis">lost</em>. Some state
information may remain on the server and be out-of-date, but this
"excess" state is flushed by the server's status
monitor. After a client reboot, the server's status daemon
notices the inconsistency between the locks held by the server and
those the client thinks it holds. It informs the server
<em class="emphasis">lockd</em> that locks from the rebooted client need
reclaiming. The server's <em class="emphasis">lockd</em> sets a
grace period  --  45 seconds by default  --  during which the
locks must be reclaimed or be lost. When a client reboots, it will
not reclaim any locks, because there is no record of the locks in its
local <em class="emphasis">lockd</em>. The server releases all of them,
removing the old state from the client-server system.</p>


Think of this server-side responsibility as dealing with your
checkbook and your local bank branch. You keep one set of records,
tracking what your balance is, and the bank maintains its own
information about your account. The bank's information is the
"truth," no matter how good or bad your recording keeping
is. If you vanish from the earth or stop contacting the bank, then
the bank tries to contact you for some finite grace period. After
that, the bank releases its records and your money. On the other
hand, if the bank were to lose its computer records in a disaster, it
could ask you to<a name="INDEX-1177" /> submit<a name="INDEX-1178" /> <a name="INDEX-1179" /> checks and deposit slips to recreate
the records of your account.</p>
