<a name="INDEX-1475" /></a><a name="INDEX-1476" /></a><a name="INDEX-1477" /></a><a name="INDEX-1478" /></a>Traps provide a way for an agent to send
a monitoring station asynchronous notification about conditions that
the monitor should know about. The traps that an agent can generate
are defined by the MIBs it supports; the number of traps can range
from zero to hundreds. To see what traps are defined in any MIB file,
search for the term "TRAP-TYPE" (SMIv1) or
"NOTIFICATION-TYPE" (SMIv2) in the MIB file. This search
will quickly get you a list of possible traps.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1479" /></a>Of course, just having
asynchronous traps arrive at your NMS isn't terribly useful.
You can configure the NMS's response to different traps; the
response can be anything from discarding the trap to running a script
that sends a message to your pager (or even takes some drastic
action, such as shutting down your power supplies). In this chapter,
we'll show you how to handle incoming traps using OpenView and
other tools such as Perl. Then we'll discuss how to read and
configure different aspects of trap events. Finally, we'll show
you how to define your own traps that report special conditions of
particular interest to your network.

<a name="INDEX-1482" /></a><a name="INDEX-1483" /></a><a name="INDEX-1484" /></a>Before discussing the tools for
receiving and generating traps, it's worth reviewing what a
trap is. Traps were introduced in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "A Closer Look at SNMP"</a>. A
trap is basically an asynchronous notification sent from an SNMP
agent to a network-management station. Like everything else in SNMP,
traps are sent using UDP (port 162) and are therefore unreliable.
This means that the sender cannot assume that the trap actually
arrives, nor can the destination assume that it's getting all
the traps being sent its way. Of course, on a healthy network most
traps should reach their destinations. But if networks were always
healthy, we wouldn't need SNMP.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1485" /></a><a name="INDEX-1486" /></a><a name="INDEX-1487" /></a><a name="INDEX-1488" /></a><a name="INDEX-1489" /></a><a name="INDEX-1490" /></a><a name="INDEX-1491" /></a>In somewhat more detail, a trap is a bundle
of data that's defined by a MIB. Traps fall into two
categories, generic and enterprise-specific. There are seven generic
trap numbers (0-6), defined in <a href="ch02_06.html#enettdg-CHP-2-TABLE-8">Table 2-8</a>, for
conditions ranging from system reboots
(<em class="emphasis">coldStart</em>) and interface state changes
(<em class="emphasis">linkUp</em> and <em class="emphasis">linkDown</em>) to
generic trap 6 (<em class="emphasis">enterpriseSpecific</em>).
Enterprise-specific traps are the loophole that makes the trap
mechanism so powerful. Anyone with an enterprise number can define
enterprise-specific traps for whatever conditions they consider worth
monitoring. An enterprise-specific trap is identified by two pieces
of information: the enterprise ID of the organization that defined
the trap and a specific trap number assigned by that organization.
The notion of an enterprise-specific trap is extremely flexible,
because organizations are allowed to subdivide their enterprises as
much as they like. For example, if your enterprise number is 2789,
your enterprise ID is <em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789</em>. But you
can further subdivide this, defining traps with enterprise IDs such
as <em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.5000</em>,
<em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.5001</em>, and so on.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1492" /></a><a name="INDEX-1493" /></a>The fact that
you've received a trap and therefore know its generic trap
number, enterprise ID, and specific trap number is often all you need
to diagnose a problem. But traps also carry additional information.
In the case of generic traps 0-5, the specific information is
predefined and hardwired into the NMS. When you receive a generic
trap, the NMS knows how to interpret the information it contains and
will be able to display it appropriately, whether it's the time
of the reboot or the identity of the interface that just changed
state. In contrast, the information carried by an enterprise-specific
trap is entirely up to the person who defined the trap. An
enterprise-specific trap can contain any number of variable bindings,
or MIB object-value pairs. When you define your own traps, you can
decide what information is appropriate for them to carry. The objects
contained in a trap can be standard MIB objects, vendor-specific
objects, or objects of your own devising. It's common to define
objects purely for the purpose of including them within a trap.

<a name="INDEX-1505" /></a>SNMPv2
defines traps in a slightly different way. In a MIB, Version 1 traps
are defined as <tt class="literal">TRAP-TYPE</tt>, while Version 2 traps
are defined as <tt class="literal">NOTIFICATION-TYPE</tt>. SNMPv2 also does
away with the notion of generic traps -- instead, it defines many
specific traps (properly speaking, notifications) in public MIBs.
SNMPv3 traps, which are discussed briefly in <a href="appf_01.html">Appendix F, "SNMPv3"</a>, are simply SNMPv2 traps with added
authentication and privacy capabilities.Most SNMP implementations
support only Version 1.
