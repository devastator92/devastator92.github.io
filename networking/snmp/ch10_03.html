<h2 class="sect1">10.3. Sending Traps</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1641" /><a name="INDEX-1642" /><a name="INDEX-1643" /><a name="INDEX-1644" /> <a name="INDEX-1645" /><a name="INDEX-1646" /><a name="INDEX-1647" />By now you should have a mechanism in
place for receiving traps. In this section, we'll look at some
different utilities that send traps and allow you to develop traps
that are appropriate for your own environment. You'll notice
that almost all trap utilities are command-line based. This allows
you to execute the command from within a script, which is almost
always what you want to do. For example, you can write a shell script
that checks disk space every five minutes and sends a trap to the NMS
if you're running low. You can also use these trap generators
within existing programs and scripts. If you have a Perl script that
accesses a database, you can use the Perl SNMP module to send a trap
from within the script if a database insert fails. The possibilities
are almost endless.
</p>

Although there are many different <i class="command">snmptrap</i>
programs, they are all fundamentally similar. In particular, though
their command-line syntax may vary, they all expect roughly the same
arguments:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Port</b></dt>
<dd>
The UDP port to which to send the trap. The default port is 162.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>SNMP version</b></dt>
<dd>
The SNMP version appropriate to the trap you want to send. Many traps
are defined only for Version 2. Note that many SNMP tools support
only Version 1.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Hostname or IP address of NMS</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1648" /><a name="INDEX-1649" /><a name="INDEX-1650" /><a name="INDEX-1651" />The hostname or IP address of your
NMS -- i.e., the trap's destination. It is better to use an
IP address than a hostname in case you are sending traps during a
Domain Name System (DNS) outage. Remember that SNMP is most valuable
when your network is failing; therefore, try to avoid assuming that
you have a fully functional network when you design traps.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Community name</b></dt>
<dd>
The community name to be sent with the trap. Most management stations
can be configured to ignore traps that don't have an
appropriate community string.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Enterprise OID</b></dt>
<dd>
The full enterprise OID for the trap you want to send: everything in
the trap's OID from the initial <em class="emphasis">.1</em> up to
the enterprise number, including any subtrees within the enterprise
but not the specific trap number. For example, if your enterprise
number is 2789, you've further subdivided your enterprise to
include a group of traps numbered 5000, and you want to send specific
trap 1234, the enterprise OID would be
<em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.5000</em>. 
</p>

If you have some reason to send a generic trap, you can set the
enterprise ID to anything you want -- but it's probably best
to set the enterprise ID to your own enterprise number, if you have
one.
</p>

Now for the most confusing case. There are a few specific traps
defined in various public MIBs. How do you send them? Basically, you
construct something that looks like an enterprise OID. It's
best to look at an example. One such trap is
<em class="emphasis">rdbmsOutOfSpace</em>, which is defined in the RDBMS
MIB. Its complete OID is <em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.2.1.39.2.2</em>
(<em class="emphasis">.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.rdbmsMIB.rdbmsTraps.rdbmsOutOfSpace</em>).
To send this trap, which is really an SNMPv2 notification, you would
use everything up to <em class="emphasis">rdbmsTraps</em> as the
enterprise OID, and the entire object ID as the specific trap number.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Hostname or IP address of sender</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1652" /><a name="INDEX-1653" />The IP address of the agent that is
sending the trap. Although this may appear to be superfluous, it can
be important if there is a proxy server between the agent and the
NMS. This parameter allows you to record the actual address of the
agent within the SNMP packet; in turn, the NMS will read the
agent's address from the trap and ignore the packet's
sender address. If you don't specify this parameter, it will
almost always default to the address of the machine sending the trap.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Generic trap number</b></dt>
<dd>
A number in the range 0-6. The true generic traps have numbers 0-5;
if you're sending an enterprise-specific trap, set this number
to 6. <a href="ch02_06.html#enettdg-CHP-2-TABLE-8">Table 2-8</a> lists the generic traps.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Specific trap number</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1654" />A number indicating the specific trap
you want to send. If you're sending a generic trap, this
parameter is ignored -- you're probably better off setting
it to zero. If you're sending a specific trap, the trap number
is up to you. For example, if you send a trap with the OID
<em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2500.3003.0</em>, 3003 is the specific
trap number.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Timestamp</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1655" /><a name="INDEX-1656" />The time elapsed
between the last initialization of the network entity and the
generation of the trap.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>OID_1, type_1, value_1</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1657" /><a name="INDEX-1658" />
<a name="INDEX-1659" /><a name="INDEX-1660" />Data bindings to be included in the trap.
Each data binding consists of an OID together with a datatype,
followed by the value you want to send. Most programs let you include
any number of data bindings in a trap. Note that the OIDs for these
variable bindings are often specific to the trap and therefore
"underneath" the specific OID for the trap. But this
isn't a requirement, and it's often useful to send
bindings that aren't defined as part of the trap.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

Before we start to tackle this section, let's take a moment to
review what we learned in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "A Closer Look at SNMP"</a> about the
various datatypes:
</p>

<ul><li>
Each variable that we send has a particular datatype.</p>
</li><li>
Different datatypes are supported by different versions of SNMP.</p>
</li><li>
Some common datatypes are <tt class="literal">INTEGER</tt>,
<tt class="literal">OctetString</tt>, <tt class="literal">Null</tt>,
<tt class="literal">Counter</tt>, <tt class="literal">Gauge</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">TimeTicks</tt>.
</p>
</li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-1661" />Be aware that
not all programs support all datatypes. For example, the Perl SNMP
module supports only the <tt class="literal">OctetString</tt>,
<tt class="literal">INTEGER</tt>, and <tt class="literal">OID</tt> types, while
the OpenView and Net_SNMP <i class="command">snmptrap</i> commands
support these three and many more. For each of the packages we use we
will list, if applicable, each datatype the program supports.
</p>

In the next sections, we'll discuss <i class="command">snmptrap</i>
programs from OpenView, Network Computing Technologies, and Net-SNMP.
We'll also include a script that uses a Perl module to send
traps. If you are not using these particular programs in your
environment, don't worry. You should still be able to relate
these examples to your in-house programs.

has a command-line program for generating arbitrary traps called
<i class="command">snmptrap</i>. <i class="command">snmptrap</i> supports the
<tt class="literal">counter</tt>, <tt class="literal">counter32</tt>,
<tt class="literal">counter64</tt>,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-50">[50]</a>
<tt class="literal">gauge</tt>, <tt class="literal">gauge32</tt>,
<tt class="literal">integer</tt>, <tt class="literal">integer32</tt>,
<tt class="literal">ipaddress</tt>, <tt class="literal">null</tt>,

<tt class="literal">opaqueascii</tt>, <tt class="literal">opaquehex</tt>,
<tt class="literal">opaqueoctal</tt>, <tt class="literal">timeticks</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">unsigned32</tt> datatypes. Its command-line structure
looks like this:
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-50" />[50]This type will work
only on agents that support SNMPv2.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">snmptrap -c community [-p port] node_addr enterprise_id agent-addr generic \
specific timestamp [OID type value] ...</pre></blockquote>

Here's a typical <i class="command">snmptrap</i> command. It sends
one trap, with three ASCII-string variable bindings for values:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>/opt/OV/bin/snmptrap -c public nms \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2500 "" 6 3003 "" \ </b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2500.3003.1 octetstringascii "Oracle" \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2500.3003.2 octetstringascii "Backup Not Running" \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2500.3003.3 octetstringascii "Call the DBA Now for Help"</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1669" /><a name="INDEX-1670" /><a name="INDEX-1671" />It's a
complicated command, and it's hard to imagine that you would
ever type it on the command line. Let's break it up into
pieces. The first line specifies the community string
(<tt class="literal">public</tt>) and the address to which the trap should
be sent (<tt class="literal">nms</tt>, though in practice it would be
better to use an IP address rather than a node name). The next line
is in many respects the most complicated. It specifies the enterprise
ID for the trap we're going to send
(<tt class="literal">.1.3.5.1.6.1.2789.2500</tt>, which is a subtree of the
enterprise-specific tree we've devoted to traps); the address
of the agent sending the trap (in this case, the null string
<tt class="literal">""</tt>, which defaults to the agent's address;
if you're using a proxy server, it is useful to specify the
agent's address explicitly); the generic trap number
(<tt class="literal">6</tt>, which is used for all enterprise-specific
traps); the specific trap number (<tt class="literal">3003</tt>, which
we've assigned); and a timestamp (<tt class="literal">""</tt>, which
defaults to the current time).
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1672" />
<a name="INDEX-1673" />The remaining three lines specify
three variable bindings to be included with the trap. For each
binding, we have the variable's object ID, its datatype, and
its value. The variables we're sending are defined in our
private (enterprise-specific) MIB, so their OIDs all begin with
<em class="emphasis">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2500</em>. All the variables are
strings, so their datatype is <tt class="literal">octetstringascii</tt>.
The trap PDU will be packed with these three strings, among other
things. The program that receives the trap will decode the trap PDU
and realize that there are three variable bindings in the trap. These
variable bindings, like the one that reads "Call the DBA Now
for Help," can be used to alert the operator that something bad
has happened.

<h3 class="sect2">10.3.2. Sending Traps with Perl</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1674" /><a name="INDEX-1675" /><a name="INDEX-1676" /><a name="INDEX-1677" /><a name="INDEX-1678" /><a name="INDEX-1679" /><a name="INDEX-1680" />In <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Polling and Setting"</a> we learned how to use the
<i class="command">get</i> and <i class="command">set</i> pieces of the SNMP
Perl module. In this section we'll see how to use the
<tt class="literal">snmptrap( )</tt> routine to generate traps. Currently,
<tt class="literal">SNMP_util</tt> supports only three types for traps:
<tt class="literal">string</tt>, <tt class="literal">int</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">oid</tt>. This can seem limiting, but it covers most
needs. Here's how <i class="command">snmptrap</i> is called:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="replaceable">snmptrap(communityname@host:port_number, enterpriseOID, host_name_from, \
generic_ID, specific_ID, OID, type, value, [OID, type, value ...])</em></pre></blockquote>

One call to <i class="command">snmptrap</i> can include any number of
values; for each value, you must specify the object ID, the datatype,
and the value you're reporting. The next script generates a
trap with only one value:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/local/bin/perl
# Filename: /opt/local/perl_scripts/snmptrap.pl 

use SNMP_util "0.54";  # This will load the BER and SNMP_Session for us

snmptrap("public\@nms:162", ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789", "sunserver1", 6, 1247, \
         ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.1247.1", "int", "2448816");</pre></blockquote>

The call to <tt class="literal">snmptrap( )</tt> sends a trap to port 162
on host <tt class="literal">nms</tt>. The trap is sent from host
<tt class="literal">sunserver1</tt>; it contains a single variable binding,
for the object <tt class="literal">.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.1247.1</tt>. The
OID's type is <tt class="literal">int</tt> and its value is
<tt class="literal">2448816</tt>.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1681" />
<a name="INDEX-1682" />Now let's try sending a trap
with multiple values (multiple variable bindings). The first object
we'll report is an integer, to which we give the arbitrary
value <tt class="literal">4278475</tt>. The second object has a string
value and is a warning that our database has stopped. Because
we're using OIDs that belong to our own enterprise, we can
define these objects to be anything we want:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">snmptrap("public\@nms:162", ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789", "sunserver2", 6, 3301, \
         ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.3301.1", "int",    "4278475", \
         ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.3301.2", "string", "Sybase DB Stopped");</pre></blockquote>

We can use the Net-SNMP <i class="command">snmptrapd</i> program to
monitor the traps coming in. We executed the preceding Perl code
while running <i class="command">snmptrapd</i> in
<em class="emphasis">stdout</em> mode, and received:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>./snmptrapd -P</b></tt>
1999-10-12 09:45:08  [12.1.45.26] enterprises.2789.3000:
        Enterprise Specific Trap (3301) Uptime: 0:00:00
        enterprises.2789.3301.1 = 4278475
        enterprises.2789.3301.2 = "Sybase DB Stopped"</pre></blockquote>

<i class="command">snmptrapd</i><a name="INDEX-1683" /><a name="INDEX-1684" /> reported both of the values we sent in
the trap: we see the integer value <tt class="literal">4278475</tt> and the
notification that Sybase has stopped. Although this example is highly
artificial, it's not all that different from what you would do
when writing your own monitoring software. You would write whatever
code is necessary to monitor vital systems such as your database and
use the Perl SNMP module to send traps when significant events occur.
You can then use any program capable of receiving traps to inform you
when the traps arrive. If you want, you can add logic that analyzes
the values sent in the trap or takes other actions, such as notifying
an operator via a pager.

<a name="INDEX-1691" /><a name="INDEX-1692" />This Windows-based
command-line utility gives us the same features as its Unix
counterparts. It understands the <tt class="literal">String</tt>,
<tt class="literal">Counter</tt>, <tt class="literal">Gauge</tt>,
<tt class="literal">Integer</tt>, <tt class="literal">Address</tt>,
<tt class="literal">OID</tt>, and <tt class="literal">TimeTicks</tt> datatypes.
The command line for <i class="command">nttrapgen</i> looks like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">nttrapgen.exe -d DestinationIpAddress:port -c CommunityName
              -o senderOID -i senderIP -g GenericTrapType 
              -s SpecificTrapType -t timestamp -v OID TYPE VALUE</pre></blockquote>

Here's how to use <i class="command">nttrapgen</i> to send a trap
notifying us that the UPS battery is running low. We use the
<tt class="literal">String</tt> datatype to send an informative message,
and we use trap 4025.1 from our private enterprise ID, 2789:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">C:\tools&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>nttrapgen.exe -d nms:162 -c public -o ^ </b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.4025 -i 10.123.456.4 -g 6 -s 4025 -t 124501 ^</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>-v 1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.4025.1 STRING 5 Minutes Left On UPS Battery</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

This trap will be sent to our network-management station (which has
the hostname <tt class="literal">nms</tt>) on port 162, which is the
standard port for SNMP traps. Any management station should be able
to receive the trap and act on it appropriately. You can use this
command in batch scripts, which are essentially the same as Unix
shell scripts. Therefore, you can use <i class="command">nttrapgen</i> to
generate traps as you need them: you can write scripts that monitor
key processes and generate traps when any interesting events take
place. As with the earlier Perl example, you can use this simple trap
generator in your environment if you don't need a heavy-duty
management system.

Here's how the Net-SNMP <i class="command">snmptrap</i> program is
invoked:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="replaceable">snmptrap hostname community enterprise-oid agent \
generic-trap specific-trap uptime [OID type value]...</em></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1702" /><a name="INDEX-1703" />If you use two single quotes
(<tt class="literal">''</tt>) in place of the time,
<i class="command">snmptrap</i> inserts the current time into the trap.
The following command generates a trap with a single value. The
object ID is <tt class="literal">2005.1</tt>, within our private
enterprise; the value is a string that tells us that the web server
has been restarted:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>snmptrap nms public .1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2005 ntserver1 6 2476317 '' \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>.1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.2005.1 s "WWW Server Has Been Restarted"</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1704" />
<a name="INDEX-1705" />Here's how to send a Version
2 notification with Net-SNMP:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-51">[51]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-51" />[51]For information about
sending Version 3 notifications with Net-SNMP, see <a href="appf_01.html">Appendix F, "SNMPv3"</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>snmptrap -v2c nms public '' .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3 \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>ifIndex i 2 ifAdminStatus i 1 ifOperStatus i 1</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1706" /><a name="INDEX-1707" /><a name="INDEX-1708" /><a name="INDEX-1709" /><a name="INDEX-1710" />The command is actually simpler than
its Version 1 equivalent. There are no generic numbers, specific
numbers, or vendor IDs. The <tt class="literal">""</tt> argument defaults
to the current system uptime. The OID specifies the
<em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> notification, with three data bindings
specifying the link's status. The definition of
<em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> in the IF-MIB states that the
<em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> notification must include the
<em class="emphasis">ifIndex</em>, <em class="emphasis">ifAdminStatus</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">ifOperStatus</em> objects, which report the index of
the interface that went down, its administrative status, and its
operational status, respectively. For
<em class="emphasis">ifAdminStatus</em> and
<em class="emphasis">ifOperStatus</em>, a value of <tt class="literal">1</tt>
indicates that the link is up. So this notification reports that
interface 2 has changed its state from "down" to
"up."
</p>

Again, the <i class="command">snmptrap</i> command-line tool lets you
integrate SNMP monitoring into shell scripts and other programs.

equipment, you should verify that it generates traps correctly.
Testing your equipment's ability to generate traps has the
added benefit of testing the behavior of your NMS; you can ensure
that it handles traps in the way you want. The best way to test new
hardware is to read your vendor's MIB and look for all the
<tt class="literal">TRAP-TYPE</tt>s they have defined. This will give you a
good feel for what sort of traps your vendor has implemented. For
example, I read through our APC MIB and noticed that the unit will
send a trap when it goes onto battery power if the AC power goes out.
To test this feature, I secured the area in our datacenter and
switched off the circuit breaker to simulate a power failure. The
trap was generated, but it showed up in the Error event category
because I did not have the correct MIB loaded in OpenView. I took the
OID from the Error events and searched the APC MIBs for a match. When
I found one, I loaded the MIB file into OpenView and repeated the
test. This time, when the trap was received OpenView put an
informative message in the Event Categories.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1724" /> <a name="INDEX-1725" />Most SNMP-compatible routers, switches,
and network devices can generate <em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> traps.
From RFC 1157, a <em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> trap is a
"failure in one of the communication links represented in the
agent's configuration." This means that if you start
unplugging ports on your router you should receive traps, right? Yes,
but first make sure you don't start disconnecting production
database servers. Furthermore, make sure you don't disconnect
the port by which your device would send the trap back to the NMS.
Remember, SNMP is designed with the assumption that the network is
unreliable -- if something sends a trap but there's no way
for the trap to reach its destination, no one will find out. By
default, a <em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> trap won't appear in
OpenView's Event Categories, because the default setting for
<em class="emphasis">linkDown</em> is "Log only"; watch the
log file <em class="filename">$OV_LOG/trapd.log</em> to see these traps
arrive. Once you have a mechanism for receiving traps, bringing the
link up and down on your device should send some traps your way.

<h3 class="sect2">10.3.6. Using Hooks with Your Programs</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1726" /><a name="INDEX-1727" /><a name="INDEX-1728" /><a name="INDEX-1729" /><a name="INDEX-1730" /><a name="INDEX-1731" />A <em class="firstterm">hook</em> is a
convenient interface that lets you integrate your own code into some
other product. The <em class="emphasis">Emacs</em> text editor is a good
example of a program that uses hooks, almost entirely, to allow its
users to extend how it operates. Let's look at the following
simple program to explain this concept further:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Logical Sample Program NH1
# PROGRAM COMMENTS
# PROGRAM BEGINS

		PROGRAM ADDS           $VAR1 + $VAR2 = $VAR3
		PROGRAM SUBTRACTS      $VAR5 - $VAR6 = $VAR7
		PROGRAM PRINTS RESULTS $VAR3 $VAR7

# PROGRAM ENDS</pre></blockquote>

This program simply <tt class="literal">ADDS</tt>,
<tt class="literal">SUBTRACTS</tt>, and <tt class="literal">PRINTS</tt>
<tt class="literal">RESULTS</tt>; it does not have any hooks. To add a
feature, you have to modify the code. For a small program like this
that is a trivial exercise, but it would be difficult in a program of
any size. The next program contains some hooks that let you add
extensions:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Logical Sample Program H1
# PROGRAM COMMENTS
# PROGRAM BEGINS
   PROGRAM RUNS $PATH/start.sh

   PROGRAM ADDS           $VAR1 + $VAR2 = $VAR3
   PROGRAM SUBTRACTS      $VAR5 - $VAR6 = $VAR7
   PROGRAM PRINTS RESULTS $VAR3 $VAR7

   PROGRAM RUNS $PATH/end.sh
# PROGRAM ENDS</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1732" /><a name="INDEX-1733" />Notice
the two additional <tt class="literal">RUNS</tt> statements. These hooks
allow you to run anything you want at the start or end of the
program. The first program, <em class="filename">start.sh</em>, might be
as simple as the command <i class="command">echo "I am
starting"</i>, which sends a simple message to the system
or management console. This script could also call one of the
trap-generation programs to send a trap to the NMS stating that some
program is starting. It would be even more useful to send a message
when the program terminates, possibly including information about the
program's status. Here's a slightly more complicated
program that runs a script, providing a number of arguments so that
the script can send useful information back to the NMS when it
generates a trap:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Logical Sample Program H2
# PROGRAM COMMENTS
# PROGRAM BEGINS
   PROGRAM RUNS $PATH/start.sh $PROGRAM_NAME

   PROGRAM ADDS           $VAR1 + $VAR2 = $VAR3
   PROGRAM SUBTRACTS      $VAR5 - $VAR6 = $VAR7
   PROGRAM PRINTS RESULTS $VAR3 $VAR7

   PROGRAM RUNS $PATH/end.sh $PROGRAM_NAME $VAR1 $VAR2 $VAR3 $VAR5 $VAR6 $VAR7
# PROGRAM ENDS</pre></blockquote>

With the additional arguments available to the hook programs, we can
generate messages like "The Program Widget has ended with sales
at $4 and YTD at $7." If your hook programs are shell scripts,
you can simply add <i class="command">snmptrap</i> commands via a text
editor. Once you finish adding the <i class="command">snmptrap</i> code,
you can test your hook program by running it on the command line.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1734" /><a name="INDEX-1735" /><a name="INDEX-1736" />On most systems, many scripts can
benefit from <i class="command">snmptrap</i> hooks. On Solaris or Linux
machines, for example, some of your <em class="filename">/etc/init.d</em>
scripts can be retrofitted to make use of <i class="command">snmptrap</i>
commands. It might be useful to have some kind of notification when
important processes such as your web server or DNS server start and
stop. Having such information on hand might make life much easier for
your helpdesk. (The Concord SystemEDGE SNMP agent provides more
rigorous process-monitoring capabilities. See <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Extensible SNMP Agents"</a> for more information on this product.)
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1737" />It's harder to add hooks to programs
written in languages like C, because you need access to the source
code as well as the ability to figure out where to place the hooks.
Once you have identified where your hooks go and added them, you must
recompile the source code. Some programs have hooks built in,
allowing you to run external programs or RPCs. Check your
program's documentation for the locations of these hooks. This
is much more convenient than trying to build your own hooks into
another program. Once you have established what these external
programs are called, you can start writing your own traps or adding
to existing ones.<a name="INDEX-1738" /><a name="INDEX-1739" /><a name="INDEX-1740" /><a name="INDEX-1741" />
