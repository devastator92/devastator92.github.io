<a name="INDEX-1166" /></a><a name="INDEX-1167" /></a><a name="INDEX-1168" /></a><a name="INDEX-1169" /></a>SNMP gives you the ability to poll your
devices regularly, collecting their management information.
Furthermore, you can tell the NMS that there are certain thresholds
that, if crossed, require some sort of action. For example, you might
want to be notified if the traffic at an interface jumps to an
extremely high (or low) value; that event might signal a problem with
the interface, or insufficient capacity, or even a hostile attack on
your network. When such a condition occurs, the NMS can forward an
alarm to an event-correlation engine or have an icon on an OpenView
map flash. To make this more concrete, let's say that the NMS
is polling the status of an interface on a router. If the interface
goes down, the NMS reports what has happened so the problem can be
quickly resolved.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1170" /></a><a name="INDEX-1171" /></a><a name="INDEX-1172" /></a><a name="INDEX-1173" /></a><a name="INDEX-1174" /></a><a name="INDEX-1175" /></a>SNMP can perform either internal or
external polling. <em class="firstterm">Internal</em> polling is
typically used in conjunction with an application that runs as a
daemon or a facility such as <i class="command">cron</i> that
periodically runs a local application.
<em class="firstterm">External</em> polling is done by the NMS. The
OpenView NMS provides a great implementation of external polling; it
can graph and save your data for later retrieval or notify you if it
looks like something has gone wrong. Many software packages make good
NMSs, and if you're clever about scripting you can throw
together an NMS that's fine-tuned to your needs. In this
chapter, we will look at a few of the available packages.
</p><p>

Polling is like checking the oil in a car; this analogy may help you
to think about appropriate polling strategies. Three distinct items
concern us when checking the oil: the physical process (opening the
hood, pulling out the dipstick, and putting it back in); the preset
gauge that tells us if we have a problem (is the level too high, too
low, or just right?); and the frequency with which we check it (once
an hour, week, month, or year?).
</p><p>

Let's assume that you ask your mechanic to go to the car and
check the oil level. This is like an NMS sending a packet to a router
to perform an <i class="command">snmpget</i> on some piece of
information. When the mechanic is finished, you pay him $30 and go on
your way. Because a low oil level may result in real engine damage,
you want to check the oil regularly. So how long should you wait
until you send the mechanic out to the car again? Checking the oil
has a cost: in this scenario, you paid $30. In networks, you pay with
bandwidth. Like money, you have only so much bandwidth, and you
can't spend it frivolously. So the real question is, how long
can you wait before checking the oil again without killing your
budget?
</p><p>

The answer lies within the car itself. A finely tuned racing car
needs to have its fluids at perfect levels. A VW Beetle,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-36">[36]</a> unlike a racecar, can have plus or minus a quart at any
time without seriously hindering its performance. You're
probably not driving a Beetle, but you're probably not driving
a racecar either. So you decide that you can check the oil level
about every three weeks. But how will you know what is low, high, or
just right?
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-36" /></a>[36]The old ones from the 1960s, not the fancy modern ones.</p><p>
</blockquote>

The car's dipstick tells you. Your mechanic doesn't need
to know the car model, engine type, or even the amount of oil in the
car; he only needs to know what value he gets when he reads the
dipstick. On a network, a device's dipstick is called an agent,
and the dipstick reading is the SNMP response packet. All
SNMP-compatible devices contain standardized agents (dipsticks) that
can be read by any mechanic (NMS). It is important to keep in mind
that the data gathered is only as good as the agent, or mechanic,
that generated it.
</p><p>

In both cases, some predefined threshold determines the appropriate
action. In the oil example, the threshold is "low oil,"
which triggers an automatic response: add oil. (Crossing the
"high oil" threshold might trigger a different kind of
response.) If we're talking about a router interface, the
possible values we might receive are "up" and
"down." Imagine that your company's gateway to the
Internet, a port on a router, must stay up 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. If that port goes down, you could lose $10,000 for each second
it stays down. Would you check that port often? Most organizations
won't pay someone to check router interfaces every hour, let
alone every second. Even if you had the time, that wouldn't be
fun, right? This is where SNMP polling comes in. It allows network
managers to guarantee that mission-critical devices are up and
functioning properly, without having to pay someone to constantly
monitor routers, servers, etc.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1176" /></a><a name="INDEX-1177" /></a>Once
you determine your monitoring needs, you can specify at what interval
you would like to poll a device or set of devices. This is typically
referred to as the <em class="firstterm">poll interval</em>, and can be
as granular as you like (e.g., every second, every hour, etc.). The
threshold value at which you take action doesn't need to be
binary: you might decide that something's obviously wrong if
the number of packets leaving your Internet connection falls below a
certain level.
<a name="INDEX-1178" /></a><a name="INDEX-1179" /></a><a name="INDEX-1180" /></a>
</p><p>


<a name="ch09-3-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>TIP: </b> 
Whenever you are figuring out how often to
poll a device, remember to keep three things in mind: the
device's agent/CPU, bandwidth consumption, and the types of
values you are requesting. Some values you receive may be 10-minute
averages. If this is the case, it is a waste to poll every few
seconds. Review the MIBs surrounding the data for which you are
polling. My preference is to start polling fairly often. Once I see
the trends and peak values, I back off. This can add congestion to
the network but ensures that I don't miss any important
information.
</p><p>
</blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1181" /></a><a name="INDEX-1182" /></a><a name="INDEX-1183" /></a>Whatever the frequency at which
you poll, keep in mind other things that may be happening on the
network. Be sure to stagger your polling times to avoid other events
if possible. Keep in mind backups, data loads, routing updates, and
other events that can cause stress on your networks or CPUs.

<a name="INDEX-1184" /></a><a name="INDEX-1185" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1186" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1187" /></a>It may seem like a waste of bandwidth
to poll a device just to find out that everything is okay. On a
typical day, you may poll dozens of devices hundreds or thousands of
times without discovering any failures or outages. Of course,
that's really what you want to find out -- and you'll
probably conclude that SNMP has served its purpose the first time you
discover a failed device and get the device back online before users
have had a chance to start complaining. However, in the best of all
possible worlds, you'd get the benefits of polling without the
cost: that is, without devoting a significant chunk of your
network's bandwidth to monitoring its health.
</p><p>

This <a name="INDEX-1188" /></a><a name="INDEX-1189" /></a><a name="INDEX-1190" /></a><a name="INDEX-1191" /></a><a name="INDEX-1192" /></a>is where internal polling comes
in. As its name implies, internal polling is performed by an agent
that is internal, or built in, to the device you want to manage.
Since polling is internal to the device, it doesn't require
traffic between the agent and your NMS. Furthermore, the agent doing
the polling does not have to be an actual SNMP agent, which can allow
you to monitor systems (either machines or software) that do not
support SNMP. For example, some industrial-strength
air-conditioning-equipment vendors provide operational status
information via a serial port. If the air-conditioning unit is
attached to a terminal server or similar device, it becomes easy to
use scripting languages to monitor the unit and generate traps if the
temperature exceeds a certain threshold. This internal program can be
written in your favorite scripting language, and it can check any
status information to which you can get access. All you need is a way
to get data from the script to the management station.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1193" /></a><a name="INDEX-1194" /></a><a name="INDEX-1195" /></a><a name="INDEX-1196" /></a><a name="INDEX-1197" /></a><a name="INDEX-1198" /></a><a name="INDEX-1199" /></a>One strategy for writing a
polling program is to use "hooks" within a program to
extract information that can then be fed into an SNMP trap and sent
to the NMS. We will cover traps more in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Traps"</a>. Another way to do internal polling is
to use a program (e.g., <em class="emphasis">sh</em>, Perl, or C) that is
run at set intervals. (On Unix, you would use <i class="command">cron</i>
to run a program at fixed intervals; there are similar services on
other operating systems.) Hooks and <i class="command">cron</i>-driven
scripts both allow you to check internal variables and report errors
as they are found. Here is a Perl script that checks for the
existence of a file and sends a trap if the file is not found:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/local/bin/perl
# Filename: /opt/local/perl_scripts/check4file.pl

use SNMP_util "0.54";  # This will load the BER and SNMP_Session modules for us

$FILENAME = "/etc/passwd";

#
# if the /etc/passwd file does not exist, send a trap!
#
if(!(-e $FILENAME)) { 
    snmptrap("public\@nms:162", ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789", "sunserver1", 6, 1547, \
             ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2789.1547.1", "string", "File \:$FILENAME\: Could\
             NOT Be Found");
}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1200" /></a>Here is what
the Sun-style <em class="filename">crontab</em> looks like:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>crontab -l </b></tt>

# Check for this file every 15 minutes and report trap if not found
4,19,34,49 * * * * /opt/local/perl_scripts/check4file.pl</pre></blockquote>

Notice that we poll four minutes after each quarter hour, rather than
on the quarter hour. The next poll we insert into the
<em class="filename">crontab</em> file may run five minutes after the
quarter hour (5,20,35,50). This practice prevents us from starting a
huge number of programs at the same time. It's a particularly
good idea to avoid polling on the hour -- that's a popular
time for random programs and <i class="command">cron</i> jobs to start
up. Consult the <i class="command">cron</i> manpage if you are unfamiliar
with its operation.

<a name="INDEX-1207" /></a><a name="INDEX-1208" /></a><a name="INDEX-1209" /></a><a name="INDEX-1210" /></a>RMON
is a supplement to the MIB-II group. This group, if supported by the
device's SNMP agent, allows us to do both internal and external
polling. We can poll devices through a remote NMS (external polling)
or have the local RMON agent check itself periodically and report any
errors (internal polling). The RMON agent will send traps when error
conditions are found.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1211" /></a>Many
devices support RMON, making it an effective mechanism for internal
polling. For example, Cisco supports the Events and Alarms RMON
categories. You can configure the Alarms category to poll MIBs
internally and react in different ways when a rising or falling
threshold occurs. Each threshold has the option of calling an
internal Event. <a href="ch09_01.html#enettdg-CHP-9-FIG-1">Figure 9-1</a> shows the flow that
these two RMON categories take.
</p><p>

<a name="enettdg-CHP-9-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="123" alt="Figure 9-1" src="figs/snmp_0902.gif" width="393" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-1.  RMON process flow</h4>

<a name="INDEX-1217" /></a><a name="INDEX-1218" /></a><a name="INDEX-1219" /></a><a name="INDEX-1220" /></a>The distinction between alarms and
events is important. Each alarm is tied to a specific event, which
defines what action to perform when the alarm goes off. Once a
threshold is met, triggering an alarm, the alarm calls the event,
which can perform additional functions, including sending traps to
the NMS and writing a record in a log. Standard SNMP traps are
preconfigured by the agent's vendor, which gives network
managers no control over setting any kind of thresholds; however,
RMON allows a network manager to set rising and falling thresholds.
<a href="ch09_01.html#enettdg-CHP-9-FIG-2">Figure 9-2</a> represents the interaction between a
router's RMON agent and an NMS.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1221" /></a><a name="INDEX-1222" /></a>In <a href="ch09_01.html#enettdg-CHP-9-FIG-2">Figure 9-2</a>,
the Cisco router's SNMP agent forwards a trap to the NMS.
Notice the direction of communication: RMON trap transmission is
unidirectional. The NMS receives the trap from the Cisco router and
decides what action to take, if any.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1223" /></a><a name="INDEX-1224" /></a><a name="INDEX-1225" /></a>In
addition to sending traps, we can also log events; if we so choose,
we can even log the event without generating a trap. Logging can be
particularly useful when you are initially configuring RMON alarms
and events. If you make your alarm conditions too sensitive, you can
clog your NMS with trigger-happy RMON events. Logging can help you
fine-tune your RMON alarms before they are released into production.
</p><p>

<a name="enettdg-CHP-9-SECT-1.1.1" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.1.1.1. RMON configuration</h3>

As a practical example of how to configure RMON, we will use
Cisco's RMON implementation, starting with events. The
following IOS command defines an RMON event:<a name="INDEX-1226" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1227" /></a><a name="INDEX-1228" /></a><a name="INDEX-1229" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1230" /></a>
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">rmon event number [log] [trap community] [description string] [owner string]</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1231" /></a>If
you're familiar with IOS, you should be expecting a
corresponding <i class="command">no</i> command that discards an RMON
event:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">no rmon event number </pre></blockquote>

The parameters to these IOS commands are:</p><p>

<dl>
<dt><b>number</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the unique identification number for the event. This value
must be greater than 0; a value of 0 is not allowed.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">log</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
Tells the agent to log the entry when triggered. This argument is
optional.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">trap</tt> community</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1232" /></a><a name="INDEX-1233" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1234" /></a>Specifies
the trap community string; i.e., a community string to be included
with the trap. Many network-management programs can be configured to
respond only to traps with a particular community string.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">description</tt> string</b></dt>
<dd>
Describes the event.</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">owner</tt> string</b></dt>
<dd>
Ties the event or item to a particular person.</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="INDEX-1235" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1236" /></a><a name="INDEX-1237" /></a><a name="INDEX-1238" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1239" /></a><a name="INDEX-1240" /></a>Here are two examples of how to
create Cisco RMON events. The first line creates a rising alarm,
which facilitates sending a trap to the NMS. The second creates a
falling alarm that might indicate that traffic has returned to an
acceptable level (this alarm is logged, but doesn't generate a
trap):
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(config)#<tt class="userinput"><b>rmon event 1 log trap public description "High ifInOctets" owner dmauro</b></tt>
(config)#<tt class="userinput"><b>rmon event 2 log description "Low ifInOctets" owner dmauro</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1241" /></a><a name="INDEX-1242" /></a><a name="INDEX-1243" /></a>You
can also use logging to keep track of when the events were called.
Though you can configure traps without logging, what happens if the
line to your NMS goes down? Logging ensures that you don't lose
information when the NMS is disabled. We suggest using both
<tt class="literal">log</tt> and <tt class="literal">trap</tt> on all your
events. You can view the logs of your RMON events by issuing the
following command on the router:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">orarouter1# <tt class="userinput"><b>show rmon event</b></tt>

Event 1 is active, owned by dmauro
 Description is High ifInOctets
 Event firing causes log and trap to community public, last fired 00:05:04
 Current log entries:
      index       time   description

<a name="INDEX-1244" /></a><a name="INDEX-1245" /></a>The following command walks the
<em class="emphasis">rmon</em> event table, which displays the values we
just set:

<a name="INDEX-1246" /></a>Most of the information we set on the

indexes <tt class="literal">1</tt> and <tt class="literal">2</tt>. The first
event has the description <tt class="literal">High</tt>
<tt class="literal">ifInOctets</tt>; it is logged and a trap is generated;
the community string for the event is <tt class="literal">public</tt>; the
event's owner is <tt class="literal">dmauro</tt>; the event is
<tt class="literal">valid</tt>, which essentially means that it is enabled;
and we also see that the event has not yet occurred. Instead of using
the command line to define these events, we could have used
<i class="command">snmpset</i> either to create new events or to modify
events we already have. If you take this route, keep in mind that you
must set the <em class="emphasis">eventEntry.eventStatus</em> to
<tt class="literal">1</tt>, for "valid," for the event to work
properly.

that we have our events configured, let's start configuring
alarms to do some internal polling. We need to know what we are going
to poll, what type of data is returned, and how often we should poll.
Assume that the router is our default gateway to the Internet. We
want to poll the router's second interface, which is a serial
interface. Therefore, we want to poll
<em class="emphasis">mgmt.interfaces.ifEntry.ifInOctets.2</em> to get the
number of outbound octets on that interface, which is an
<tt class="literal">INTEGER</tt> type.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-37">[37]</a> To be precise, the <em class="emphasis">ifInOctets</em> MIB
object is defined as "The total number of octets received on
the interface, including framing characters." (The
<em class="emphasis">.2</em> at the end of the OID indicates the second
entry in the <em class="emphasis">ifEntry</em> table. On our router, this
denotes the second interface, which is the one we want to poll.) We
want to be notified if the traffic on this interface exceeds 90,000
octets/second; we'll assume things are back to normal when the
traffic falls back under 85,000 octets/second. This gives us the
rising and falling thresholds for our alarm. Next, we need to figure
out the interval at which we are going to poll this object.
Let's start by polling every 60 seconds.

<a name="INDEX-1261" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1262" /></a>Now
we need to put all this information into a Cisco RMON
<i class="command">alarm</i> command. Here is the command to create an
alarm:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">rmon alarm number variable interval {delta | absolute} 
    rising-threshold value [event-number] 
    falling-threshold value [event-number] 
    [owner string] </pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1263" /></a>The
following command discards the alarm:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">no rmon alarm number </pre></blockquote>

The parameters to these commands are:</p><p>

<dl>
<dt><b>number</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the unique identification number assigned to the alarm.</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>variable</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies which MIB object to monitor.</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>interval</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1264" /></a><a name="INDEX-1265" /></a><a name="INDEX-1266" /></a>Specifies
the frequency at which the alarm monitors the MIB variable.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">delta</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1267" /></a><a name="INDEX-1268" /></a>Indicates that the threshold values
given in the command should be interpreted in terms of the difference
between successive readings.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">absolute</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1269" /></a>Indicates that the threshold values
given in the command should be interpreted as absolute values; i.e.,
the difference between the current value and preceding values is
irrelevant.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">rising-threshold</tt> value event-number</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1270" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1271" /></a>Specifies the value at which
the alarm should be triggered, calling the event, when the value is
rising. <em class="emphasis">event-number</em> is the event that should be
called when the alarm occurs. The event number is optional because
the threshold doesn't have to be assigned an event. If either
of the two thresholds is left blank the event number will be set to
0, which does nothing.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">falling-threshold</tt> value event-number</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1272" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1273" /></a><a name="INDEX-1274" /></a><a name="INDEX-1275" /></a>Specifies the value at which the
alarm should be triggered, calling the event, when the value is
falling. <em class="emphasis">event-number</em> is the event that should
be called when the alarm occurs. The event number is optional because
the threshold doesn't have to be assigned an event. If either
of the two thresholds is left blank the event number will be set to
0, which does nothing.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">owner</tt> string</b></dt>
<dd>
Ties this alarm to a particular person.</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="INDEX-1276" /></a>To configure the alarm settings we just
described, enter the following command, in
<em class="emphasis">configuration</em> mode, on a Cisco console:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">orarouter1(config)#<tt class="userinput"><b>rmon alarm 25 ifEntry.10.2 60 absolute \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>rising-threshold 90000 1 falling-threshold 85000 2 owner dmauro</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

This command configures alarm number 25, which monitors the object in
<em class="emphasis">ifEntry.10.2</em> (instance 2 of
<em class="emphasis">ifEntry</em>.<em class="emphasis">ifInOctets</em>, or the
input octets on interface 2) every 60 seconds. It has a rising
threshold of 90,000 octets, which has event number 1 tied to it:
event 1 is called when traffic on this interface exceeds 90,000
octets/second. The falling threshold is set to 85,000 octets and has
event number 2 tied to it. Here's how the alarm looks in the
router's internal tables:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">orarouter1#<tt class="userinput"><b>show rmon alarm</b></tt>

Alarm 1 is active, owned by dmauro
 Monitors ifEntry.10.2 every 60 second(s)
 Taking absolute samples, last value was 87051
 Rising threshold is 90000, assigned to event 1
 Falling threshold is 85000, assigned to event 2
 On startup enable rising or falling alarm</pre></blockquote>

The last line of output says that the router will enable the alarm
upon reboot. As you'd expect, you can also look at the alarm
settings through the RMON MIB, beginning with the subtree
<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.16</em>. As with the events themselves,
we can create, change, edit, and delete entries using
<i class="command">snmpset</i>.

getting trends and seeing the data in a graph or table is difficult.
Even if you develop the backend systems to gather MIB objects and
display them graphically, retrieving data is sometimes painful. The
Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is a great program that allows
you to do both internal and external polling. Furthermore, it is
designed to generate graphs of your data in HTML format. MRTG is
covered in <a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, "MRTG"</a>.<a name="INDEX-1281" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1282" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1283" /></a><a name="INDEX-1284" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1285" /></a><a name="INDEX-1286" /></a><a name="INDEX-1287" /></a><a name="INDEX-1288" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1289" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1290" /></a><a name="INDEX-1291" /></a><a name="INDEX-1292" /></a>
