<h2 class="sect1">2.3. The Structure of Management Information</h2>

<a name="INDEX-156" /><a name="INDEX-157" /><a name="INDEX-158" /><a name="INDEX-159" />So far,
we have used the term "management information" to refer
to the operational parameters of SNMP-capable devices. However,
we've said very little about what management information
actually contains or how it is represented. The first step toward
understanding what kind of information a device can provide is to
understand how this data itself is represented within the context of
SNMP. The <em class="firstterm">Structure of Management Information Version
1</em>(SMIv1, RFC 1155) does exactly
that: it defines precisely how managed objects<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> are named and specifies their associated
datatypes. The <em class="firstterm">Structure of Management Information Version
2</em> (SMIv2, RFC 2578) provides enhancements for SNMPv2.
We'll start by discussing SMIv1 and will discuss SMIv2 in the
next section.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-7" />[7]For
the remainder of this book "management information" will
be referred to as "managed objects." Similarly, a single
piece of management information (such as the operational status of a
router interface) will be known as a "managed object."
</p> </blockquote>

The definition of managed objects can be broken down into three
attributes:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Name</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-160" /><a name="INDEX-161" /><a name="INDEX-162" /><a name="INDEX-163" />The name, or <em class="firstterm">object
identifier</em>(OID), uniquely defines a
managed object. Names commonly appear in two forms: numeric and
"human readable." In either case, the names are long and
inconvenient. In SNMP applications, a lot of work goes into helping
you navigate through the namespace conveniently.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Type and syntax</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-164" /><a name="INDEX-165" /><a name="INDEX-166" /><a name="INDEX-167" />A managed
object's datatype is defined using a subset of
<em class="firstterm">Abstract Syntax Notation One</em>(ASN.1). ASN.1 is a way of specifying how data is
represented and transmitted between managers and agents, within the
context of SNMP. The nice thing about ASN.1 is that the notation is
machine-independent. This means that a PC running Windows NT can
communicate with a Sun SPARC machine and not have to worry about
things such as byte ordering.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Encoding</b></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-168" /><a name="INDEX-169" />A single instance of a
managed object is encoded into a string of octets using the
<em class="firstterm">Basic Encoding Rules</em>(BER). BER defines how the objects are encoded and decoded
so they can be transmitted over a transport medium such as Ethernet.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h3 class="sect2">2.3.1. Naming OIDs</h3>

<a name="INDEX-170" /><a name="INDEX-171" /><a name="INDEX-172" /><a name="INDEX-173" /><a name="INDEX-174" /><a name="INDEX-175" />Managed
objects are organized into a tree-like hierarchy. This structure is
the basis for SNMP's naming scheme. An object ID is made up of
a series of integers based on the nodes in the tree, separated by
dots (.). Although there's a human-readable form that's
more friendly than a string of numbers, this form is nothing more
than a series of names separated by dots, each of which represents a
node of the tree. So you can use the numbers themselves, or you can
use a sequence of names that represent the numbers. <a href="ch02_03.html#enettdg-CHP-2-FIG-2">Figure 2-2</a> shows the top few levels of this tree. (We
have intentionally left out some branches of the tree that
don't concern us here.)
</p>

<a name="enettdg-CHP-2-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="325" alt="Figure 2-2" src="figs/snmp_0202.gif" width="331" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-2.  SMI object tree</h4>

<a name="INDEX-176" /><a name="INDEX-177" /><a name="INDEX-178" />In the object tree, the node at
the top of the tree is called the <em class="firstterm">root</em>,
anything with children is called a <em class="firstterm">subtree</em>,
and anything without children is called a <em class="firstterm">leaf
node</em>. For example, <a href="ch02_03.html#enettdg-CHP-2-FIG-2">Figure 2-2</a>'s
root, the starting point for the tree, is called
"Root-Node." Its subtree is made up of
<em class="emphasis">ccitt(0)</em>, <em class="emphasis">iso(1)</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">joint(2).</em> In this illustration,
<em class="emphasis">iso(1)</em> is the only node that contains a subtree;
the other two nodes are both leaf nodes.
<em class="emphasis">ccitt(0)</em> and <em class="emphasis">joint(2)</em> do
not pertain to SNMP, so they will not be discussed in this
book.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-8" />[8]The <em class="emphasis">ccitt</em> subtree is
administered by the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT); the <em class="emphasis">joint</em>
subtree is administered jointly by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) and CCITT. As we said, neither branch has
anything to do with SNMP.<a name="INDEX-179" /><a name="INDEX-180" /><a name="INDEX-181" /><a name="INDEX-182" /> </p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-183" /><a name="INDEX-184" /><a name="INDEX-185" />For the remainder of this
book we will focus on the <em class="emphasis">iso(1).org(3).dod(6
).internet(1)</em> subtree,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a> which is represented in OID form as
<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1</em> or as
<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet</em>. Each managed object has a
numerical OID and an associated textual name. The dotted-decimal
notation is how a managed object is represented internally within an
agent; the textual name, like an IP domain name, saves humans from
having to remember long, tedious strings of integers.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-9" />[9]Note that the term
"branch" is sometimes used interchangeably with
"subtree."<a name="INDEX-186" />
</p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-187" /><a name="INDEX-188" />The <em class="emphasis">directory</em>
branch currently is not used. The <em class="emphasis">management</em>
branch, or <em class="emphasis">mgmt</em>, defines a standard set of
Internet management objects. The <em class="emphasis">experimental</em>
branch is reserved for testing and research purposes. Objects under
the <em class="emphasis">private</em> branch are defined unilaterally,
which means that individuals and organizations are responsible for
defining the objects under this branch. Here is the definition of the
<em class="emphasis">internet</em> subtree, as well as all four of its
subtrees:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">internet      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso org(3) dod(6) 1 }
directory     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 1 }
mgmt          OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 2 }
experimental  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 3 }
private       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { internet 4 }</pre></blockquote>

The first line declares <em class="emphasis">internet</em> as the OID
<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1</em>, which is defined as a subtree of
<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod</em>, or <em class="emphasis">1.3.6</em> (the
<tt class="literal">::=</tt> is a definition operator). The last four
declarations are similar, but they define the other branches that
belong to <em class="emphasis">internet</em>. For the
<em class="emphasis">directory</em> branch, the notation <tt class="literal">{
internet 1 }</tt> tells us that it is part of the
<em class="emphasis">internet</em> subtree, and that its OID is
<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.1</em>. The OID for <em class="emphasis">mgmt</em>
is <em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2</em>, and so on.
</p>

There is currently one branch under the <em class="emphasis">private</em>
subtree. It's used to give hardware and software vendors the
ability to define their own private objects for any type of hardware
or software they want managed by SNMP. Its SMI definition is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">enterprises   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { private 1 }</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-189" />
<a name="INDEX-190" /><a name="INDEX-191" /><a name="INDEX-192" /><a name="INDEX-193" /><a name="INDEX-194" />The Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA) currently manages all the private enterprise
number assignments for individuals, institutions, organizations,
companies, etc.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a> A list of
all the current private enterprise numbers can be obtained from
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/enterprise-numbers">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/enterprise-numbers</a>.
As an example, Cisco Systems's private enterprise number is 9,
so the base OID for its private object space is defined as
<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.cisco</em>,
or <em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.4.1.9</em>. Cisco is free to do as it
wishes with this private branch. It's typical for companies
such as Cisco that manufacture networking equipment to define their
own private enterprise objects. This allows for a richer set of
management information than can be gathered from the standard set of
managed objects defined under the <em class="emphasis">mgmt</em> branch.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-10" />[10]The term "private
enterprise" will be used throughout this book to refer to the
<em class="emphasis">enterprises</em> branch.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-195" /><a name="INDEX-196" /><a name="INDEX-197" />
<a name="INDEX-198" /><a name="INDEX-199" />Companies aren't the
only ones who can register their own private enterprise numbers.
Anyone can do so, and it's free. The web-based form for
registering private enterprise numbers can be found at <a href="http://www.isi.edu/cgi-bin/iana/enterprise.pl">http://www.isi.edu/cgi-bin/iana/enterprise.pl</a>.
After you fill in the form, which asks for information such as your
organization's name and contact information, your request
should be approved in about a week. Why would you want to register
your own number? When you become more conversant in SNMP,
you'll find things you want to monitor that aren't
covered by any MIB, public or private. With your own enterprise
number, you can create your own private MIB that allows you to
monitor exactly what you want. You'll need to be somewhat
clever in extending your agents so that they can look up the
information you want, but it's very doable.<a name="INDEX-200" /><a name="INDEX-201" /><a name="INDEX-202" />

<a name="INDEX-208" />The
<tt class="literal">SYNTAX</tt> attribute provides for definitions of
managed objects through a subset of ASN.1. SMIv1 defines several
datatypes that are paramount to the management of networks and
network devices. It's important to keep in mind that these
datatypes are simply a way to define what kind of information a
managed object can hold. The types we'll be discussing are
similar to those that you'd find in a computer programming
language like C. <a href="ch02_03.html#enettdg-CHP-2-TABLE-1">Table 2-1</a> lists the supported
datatypes for SMIv1.

primarily used to track information such as the number of octets sent
and received on an interface or the number of errors and discards
seen on an interface. A <tt class="literal">Counter</tt> is monotonically
increasing, in that its values should never decrease during normal
operation. When an agent is rebooted, all <tt class="literal">Counter</tt>
values should be set to zero. Deltas are used to determine if
anything useful can be said for successive queries of
<tt class="literal">Counter</tt> values. A delta is computed by querying a

difference between the query results over some time interval.

<a name="INDEX-217" /><a name="INDEX-218" /><a name="INDEX-219" />The goal of all these object types is to
define managed objects. In <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "What Is SNMP?"</a>, we said that
a MIB is a logical grouping of managed objects as they pertain to a
specific management task, vendor, etc. The MIB can be thought of as a
specification that defines the managed objects a vendor or device
supports. Cisco, for instance, has literally hundreds of MIBs defined
for its vast product line. For example, its Catalyst device has a
separate MIB from its 7000 series router. Both devices have different
characteristics that require different management capabilities.
Vendor-specific MIBs typically are distributed as human-readable text
files that can be inspected (or even modified) with a standard text
editor such as <em class="emphasis">vi</em>.
</p>


<a name="ch02-9-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b> 
Most modern NMS products maintain a compact form of all the MIBs that
define the set of managed objects for all the different types of
devices they're responsible for managing. NMS administrators
will typically compile a vendor's MIB into a format the NMS can
use. Once a MIB has been loaded or compiled, administrators can refer
to managed objects using either the numeric or human-readable object
ID.
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-220" /><a name="INDEX-221" /><a name="INDEX-222" />It's important to know how to read
and understand MIB files. The following example is a stripped-down

<a name="INDEX-223" /><a name="INDEX-224" />The
first line of this file defines the name of the MIB, in this case
<tt class="literal">RFC1213-MIB</tt>. (RFC 1213 is the RFC that defines
MIB-II; many of the MIBs we refer to are defined by RFCs). The format
of this definition is always the same. The <tt class="literal">IMPORTS</tt>
section of the MIB is sometimes referred to as the
<em class="emphasis">linkage</em> section. It allows you to import
datatypes and OIDs from other MIB files using the
<tt class="literal">IMPORTS</tt> clause. This MIB imports the following
items from <tt class="literal">RFC1155-SMI</tt> (RFC 1155 defines SMIv1,
which we discussed earlier in this chapter):
</p>

<ul><li>
<tt class="literal">mgmt</tt></p>
</li><li>
<tt class="literal">NetworkAddress</tt></p>
</li><li>
<tt class="literal">IpAddress</tt></p>
</li><li>
<tt class="literal">Counter</tt></p>
</li><li>
<tt class="literal">Gauge</tt></p>
</li><li>
<tt class="literal">TimeTicks</tt></p>
</li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-225" /><a name="INDEX-226" />It also imports
<tt class="literal">OBJECT-TYPE</tt> from RFC 1212, the <em class="emphasis">Concise
MIB Definition</em>, which defines how MIB files are written.
Each group of items imported using the <tt class="literal">IMPORTS</tt>
clause uses a <tt class="literal">FROM</tt> clause to define the MIB file
from which the objects are taken.
</p>

The OIDs that will be used throughout the remainder of the MIB follow
the linkage section. This group of lines sets up the top level of the
<em class="emphasis">mib-2</em> subtree. <em class="emphasis">mib-2</em> is
defined as <em class="emphasis">mgmt</em> followed by
<em class="emphasis">.1</em>. We saw earlier that
<em class="emphasis">mgmt</em> was equivalent to
<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2</em>. Therefore, <em class="emphasis">mib-2</em>
is equivalent to <em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1</em>. Likewise, the
<em class="emphasis">interfaces</em> group under
<em class="emphasis">mib-2</em> is defined as <tt class="literal">{ mib-2 2
}</tt>, or <em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.2</em>.
</p>

After the OIDs are defined, we get to the actual object definitions.
Every object definition has the following format:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;name&gt; OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX &lt;datatype&gt;
    ACCESS &lt;either read-only, read-write, write-only, or not-accessible&gt;
    STATUS &lt;either mandatory, optional, or obsolete&gt;
    DESCRIPTION 
        "Textual description describing this particular managed object."
    ::= { &lt;Unique OID that defines this object&gt; }     </pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-227" /><a name="INDEX-228" />
<a name="INDEX-229" />The
first managed object in our subset of the MIB-II definition is
<em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>, which represents a table of network
interfaces on a managed device (note that object names are defined
using mixed case, with the first letter in lowercase). Here is its
definition using ASN.1 notation:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ifTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  SEQUENCE OF IfEntry
    ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "A list of interface entries. The number of entries is given by
         the value of ifNumber."
    ::= { interfaces 2 }</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-230" />The
<tt class="literal">SYNTAX</tt> of <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em> is
<tt class="literal">SEQUENCE</tt> <tt class="literal">OF</tt>
<tt class="literal">IfEntry</tt>. This means that
<em class="emphasis">ifTable</em> is a table containing the columns
defined in <em class="emphasis">IfEntry</em>. The object is
<tt class="literal">not-accessible</tt>, which means that there is no way
to query an agent for this object's value. Its status is
<tt class="literal">mandatory</tt>, which means an agent must implement
this object in order to comply with the MIB-II specification. The
<tt class="literal">DESCRIPTION</tt> describes what exactly this object is.
The unique OID is <em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2</em>, or
<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.interfaces.2</em>.
</p>

Let's now look at the <tt class="literal">SEQUENCE</tt> definition
from the MIB file earlier in this section, which is used with the
<tt class="literal">SEQUENCE</tt> <tt class="literal">OF</tt> type in the
<em class="emphasis">ifTable</em> definition:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">IfEntry ::=
    SEQUENCE {
        ifIndex
            INTEGER,
        ifDescr
            DisplayString,
        ifType
            INTEGER,
        ifMtu
            INTEGER,
        .
        .
        .
        ifSpecific
            OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    }</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-231" /><a name="INDEX-232" /> <a name="INDEX-233" />
<a name="INDEX-234" />Note
that the name of the sequence (<em class="emphasis">IfEntry</em>) is
mixed-case, but the first letter is capitalized, unlike the object
definition for <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>. This is how a sequence
name is defined. A sequence is simply a list of columnar objects and
their SMI datatypes, which defines a conceptual table. In this case,
we expect to find variables defined by <em class="emphasis">ifIndex</em>,
<em class="emphasis">ifDescr</em>, <em class="emphasis">ifType</em>, etc. This
table can contain any number of rows; it's up to the agent to
manage the rows that reside in the table. It is possible for an NMS
to add rows to a table. This operation is covered later, in <a href="ch02_06.html#enettdg-CHP-2-SECT-6.4">Section 2.6.4, "The set Operation"</a>.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-235" /><a name="INDEX-236" />Now that we have
<em class="emphasis">IfEntry</em> to specify what we'll find in any
row of the table, we can look back to the definition of
<em class="emphasis">ifEntry</em> (the actual rows of the table) itself:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ifEntry OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  IfEntry
    ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "An interface entry containing objects at the subnetwork layer
         and below for a particular interface."
    INDEX   { ifIndex }
    ::= { ifTable 1 }</pre></blockquote>

<em class="emphasis">ifEntry</em><a name="INDEX-237" />
defines a particular row in the <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>. Its
definition is almost identical to that of
<em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>, except we have introduced a new clause,
<tt class="literal">INDEX</tt>. The index is a unique key used to define a
single row in the <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>. It's up to the
agent to make sure the index is unique within the context of the
table. If a router has six interfaces, <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>
will have six rows in it. <em class="emphasis">ifEntry</em>'s OID is
<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1</em>, or
<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry</em>.
The index for <em class="emphasis">ifEntry</em> is
<em class="emphasis">ifIndex</em>, which is defined as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ifIndex OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  INTEGER
    ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "A unique value for each interface. Its value ranges between
         1 and the value of ifNumber. The value for each interface
         must remain constant at least from one reinitialization of the
         entity's network-management system to the next reinitialization." 
       ::= { ifEntry 1 }</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-238" />The
<em class="emphasis">ifIndex</em> object is <tt class="literal">read-only</tt>,
which means we can see its value, but we cannot change it. The final
object our MIB defines is <em class="emphasis">ifDescr</em>, which is a
textual description for the interface represented by that particular
row in the <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>. Our MIB example ends with
the <tt class="literal">END</tt> clause, which marks the end of the MIB. In
the actual MIB-II files, each object listed in the
<em class="emphasis">IfEntry</em> sequence has its own object definition.
In this version of the MIB we list only two of them, in the interest
of conserving space.<a name="INDEX-239" /><a name="INDEX-240" /><a name="INDEX-241" /><a name="INDEX-242" /><a name="INDEX-243" /><a name="INDEX-244" /><a name="INDEX-245" /><a name="INDEX-246" /><a name="INDEX-247" />
