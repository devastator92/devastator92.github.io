<h2 class="sect1">1.3. Managers and Agents</h2>

In the previous sections we've vaguely referred to SNMP-capable
devices and network-management stations. Now it's time to
describe what these two things really are. In the world of SNMP there
are two kind of entities: <em class="firstterm">managers</em> and
<em class="firstterm">agents</em>. A manager is a server running some
kind of software system that can handle management tasks for a
network. Managers are often referred to as <em class="firstterm">Network
Management Stations</em> (NMSs).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> An NMS is responsible for
polling and receiving traps from agents in the network. A
<em class="firstterm">poll</em>, in the context of network management, is
the act of querying an agent (router, switch, Unix server, etc.) for
some piece of information. This information can later be used to
determine if some sort of catastrophic event has occurred. A
<em class="firstterm">trap</em> is a way for the agent to tell the NMS
that something has happened. Traps are sent asynchronously, not in
response to queries from the NMS. The NMS is further responsible for
performing an action<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a> based upon
the information it receives from the agent. For example, when your T1
circuit to the Internet goes down, your router can send a trap to
your NMS. In turn, the NMS can take some action, perhaps paging you
to let you know that something has happened.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-1" />[1]See <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Network-Management Software"</a> for a pro-and-con discussion of some popular
NMS applications.</p> </blockquote><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-2" />[2]Note that the NMS is
preconfigured to perform this action.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-46" /><a name="INDEX-47" /><a name="INDEX-48" /><a name="INDEX-49" /><a name="INDEX-50" /><a name="INDEX-51" />The
second entity, the <em class="firstterm">agent</em>, is a piece of
software that runs on the network devices you are managing. It can be
a separate program (a daemon, in Unix language), or it can be
incorporated into the operating system (for example, Cisco's
IOS on a router, or the low-level operating system that controls a
UPS). Today, most IP devices come with some kind of SNMP agent built
in. The fact that vendors are willing to implement agents in many of
their products makes the system administrator's or network
manager's job easier. The agent provides management information
to the NMS by keeping track of various operational aspects of the
device. For example, the agent on a router is able to keep track of
the state of each of its interfaces: which ones are up, which ones
are down, etc. The NMS can query the status of each interface on a
router, and take appropriate action if any of them are down. When the
agent notices that something bad has happened, it can send a trap to
the NMS. This trap originates from the agent and is sent to the NMS,
where it is handled appropriately. Some devices will send a
corresponding "all clear" trap when there is a transition
from a bad state to a good state. This can be useful in determining
when a problem situation has been resolved. <a href="ch01_03.html#enettdg-CHP-1-FIG-1">Figure 1-1</a> shows the relationship between the NMS and an
agent.

It's important to keep in mind that polls and traps can happen
at the same time. There are no restrictions on when the NMS can query
the agent or when the agent can send a trap.
