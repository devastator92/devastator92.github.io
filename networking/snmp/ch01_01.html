today's complex network of routers, switches, and servers, it
can seem like a daunting task to manage all the devices on your
network and make sure they're not only up and running but
performing optimally. This is where the <em class="firstterm">Simple Network
Management Protocol</em> (SNMP) can help. SNMP was introduced in 1988 to meet
the growing need for a standard for managing Internet
Protocol (IP) devices. SNMP provides its users with a
"simple" set of operations that allows these devices to
be managed remotely.
</p><p>

This book is aimed toward system administrators who would like to
begin using SNMP to manage their servers or routers, but who lack the
knowledge or understanding to do so. We try to give you a basic
understanding of what SNMP is and how it works; beyond that, we show
you how to put SNMP into practice, using a number of widely available
tools. Above all, we want this to be a practical book -- a book
that helps you keep track of what your network is doing.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="enettdg-CHP-1-SECT-1" /></a> 
  <h2 class="sect1"><a name="ahead"></a>1.1. Network Management and Monitoring</h2>

<a name="INDEX-10" /></a><a name="INDEX-11" /></a><a name="INDEX-12" /></a>The core of SNMP is a simple set of
operations (and the information these operations gather) that gives
administrators the ability to change the state of some SNMP-based
device. For example, you can use SNMP to shut down an interface on
your router or check the speed at which your Ethernet interface is
operating. SNMP can even monitor the temperature on your switch and
warn you when it is too high.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-13" /></a><a name="INDEX-14" /></a><a name="INDEX-15" /></a><a name="INDEX-16" /></a>SNMP usually
is associated with managing routers, but it's important to
understand that it can be used to manage many types of devices. While
SNMP's predecessor, the <em class="firstterm">Simple Gateway Management
Protocol</em> (SGMP), was developed to manage Internet
routers, SNMP can be used to manage Unix systems, Windows systems,
printers, modem racks, power supplies, and more. Any device running
software that allows the retrieval of SNMP information can be
managed. This includes not only physical devices but also software,
such as web servers and databases.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-17" /></a><a name="INDEX-18" /></a><a name="INDEX-19" /></a><a name="INDEX-20" /></a><a name="INDEX-21" /></a>Another
aspect of network management is <em class="firstterm">network</em>
monitoring; that is, monitoring an entire network as opposed to
individual routers, hosts, and other devices.<em class="citetitle">
</em><em class="firstterm">Remote Network Monitoring</em> (RMON)
was developed to help us understand how the network itself is
functioning, as well as how individual devices on the network are
affecting the network as a whole. It can be used to monitor not only
LAN traffic, but WAN interfaces as well. We discuss RMON in more
detail later in this chapter and in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "A Closer Look at SNMP"</a>.
</p><p>

Before going any further, let's look at a before-and-after
scenario that shows how SNMP can make a difference in an
organization.
</p><p>

<a name="enettdg-CHP-1-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.1. Before and After SNMP</h3>

<a name="INDEX-22" /></a><a name="INDEX-23" /></a>Let's say that you have a
network of 100 machines running various operating systems. Several
machines are file servers, a few others are print servers, another is
running software that verifies credit card transactions (presumably
from a web-based ordering system), and the rest are personal
workstations. In addition, there are various switches and routers
that help keep the actual network going. A T1 circuit connects the
company to the global Internet, and there is a private connection to
the credit card verification system.
</p><p>

What happens when one of the file servers crashes? If it happens in
the middle of the workweek, it is likely that the people using it
will notice and the appropriate administrator will be called to fix
it. But what if it happens after everyone has gone home, including
the administrators, or over the weekend?
</p><p>

What if the private connection to the credit card verification system
goes down at 10 p.m. on Friday and isn't restored until Monday
morning? If the problem was faulty hardware and could have been fixed
by swapping out a card or replacing a router, thousands of dollars in
web site sales could have been lost for no reason. Likewise, if the
T1 circuit to the Internet goes down, it could adversely affect the
amount of sales generated by individuals accessing your web site and
placing orders.
</p><p>

These are obviously serious problems -- problems that can
conceivably affect the survival of your business. This is where SNMP
comes in. Instead of waiting for someone to notice that something is
wrong and locate the person responsible for fixing the problem (which
may not happen until Monday morning, if the problem occurs over the
weekend), SNMP allows you to monitor your network constantly, even
when you're not there. For example, it will notice if the
number of bad packets coming through one of your router's
interfaces is gradually increasing, suggesting that the router is
about to fail. You can arrange to be notified automatically when
failure seems imminent, so you can fix the router before it actually
breaks. You can also arrange to be notified if the credit card
processor appears to get hung -- you may even be able to fix it
from home. And if nothing goes wrong, you can return to the office on
Monday morning knowing there won't be any surprises.
</p><p>

There might not be quite as much glory in fixing problems before they
occur, but you and your management will rest more easily. We
can't tell you how to translate that into a higher
salary -- sometimes it's better to be the guy who rushes in
and fixes things in the middle of a crisis, rather than the guy who
makes sure the crisis never occurs. But SNMP does enable you to keep
logs that prove your network is running reliably and show when you
took action to avert an impending crisis.

<h3 class="sect2">1.1.2. Human Considerations </h3>

<a name="INDEX-24" /></a><a name="INDEX-25" /></a><a name="INDEX-26" /></a><a name="INDEX-27" /></a>Implementing a
network-management system can mean adding more staff to handle the
increased load of maintaining and operating such an environment. At
the same time, adding this type of monitoring should, in most cases,
reduce the workload of your system-administration staff. You will
need:
</p><p>

<ul><li>
<a name="INDEX-28" /></a>Staff to maintain the management station.
This includes ensuring the management station is configured to
properly handle events from SNMP-capable devices.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-29" /></a>Staff to maintain the
SNMP-capable devices. This includes making sure that workstations and
servers can communicate with the management station.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-30" /></a><a name="INDEX-31" /></a>Staff to watch and fix the
network. This group is usually called a <em class="firstterm">Network Operations
Center</em> (NOC) and is staffed 24/7. An alternative to 24/7
staffing is to implement rotating pager duty, where one person is on
call at all times, but not necessarily present in the office. Pager
duty works only in smaller networked environments, in which a network
outage can wait for someone to drive into the office and fix the
problem.
</p><p>
</li></ul>
There is no way to predetermine how many staff members you will need
to maintain a management system. The size of the staff will vary
depending on the size and complexity of the network you're
managing. Some of the larger Internet backbone providers have 70 or
more people in their NOCs, while others have only one.
