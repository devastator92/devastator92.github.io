<a name="INDEX-1983" /></a><a name="INDEX-1984" /></a><a name="INDEX-1985" /></a>The <em class="firstterm">Multi
Router Traffic Grapher</em> (MRTG) is a freely available and
fully configurable trend-analysis tool that's easy to configure
and use. It's a surprisingly small, lightweight package because
it doesn't implement a heavyweight user interface. Instead, it
generates graphs in the form of GIF or PNG images; these graphs are
embedded in standard HTML pages. Therefore, you can view MRTG's
output using any graphical web browser and even make its reports
visible across your network by using a web server.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1986" /></a><a name="INDEX-1987" /></a><a name="INDEX-1988" /></a>Although MRTG is best at displaying
usage graphs for router interfaces, it can be configured to graph
things like memory usage, load average, and disk usage on server
equipment. MRTG is particularly useful for determining when something
"peaks out" for an extended period of time, which
indicates that you have a capacity problem and need to upgrade. For
example, you might find that your T1 interface is maxed out during
your peak business hours and you need to upgrade to a bigger circuit,
or you might find that you need to add more memory to a server.
Likewise, MRTG may let you know that your network connections are
operating at a fraction of the available bandwidth and that you can
therefore eliminate a few T1 circuits and reduce your
telecommunications costs.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1989" /></a>Many sites that use MRTG use its default
graphing capabilities for capacity planning and provisioning. MRTG
doesn't provide the fine-grained statistical tools you need to
calculate baseline information or project when your network will need
to be upgraded. However, it can be a very useful tool for businesses
that don't have the resources necessary to purchase a
full-fledged trend-analysis package. Baselines and projections are
invaluable, but MRTG's graphs can give you similar behavior at
a glance; your eyes are very good at spotting typical behavior and
trends, even if they can't give you the statistical analysis
that your management might like.
</p><p>

MRTG has many options that allow you to customize how it operates. It
is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss every option; instead,
we will discuss how to install MRTG and use its default graphing
capabilities. We'll also outline how you can configure MRTG to
gather system information from a server.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1990" /></a><a name="INDEX-1991" /></a><a name="INDEX-1992" /></a><a name="INDEX-1993" /></a>It's important to understand
that MRTG is not an NMS solution. Although its graphing capabilities
make it look superficially like an NMS, it's really a simple
polling engine that's very clever about the output it
generates. It performs the same <i class="command">get</i> functions that
an NMS would, but its job isn't problem detection and
resolution. It doesn't have a facility for generating alarms or
processing traps, nor does it have the ability to set objects.
It's simply designed to provide a graphical view of how your
network is performing. If you're interested in an open source
NMS package, you should investigate Bluebird (<a href="http://www.opennms.org/">http://www.opennms.org</a>).
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="enettdg-CHP-13-SECT-1" /></a> 
  <h2 class="sect1"><a name="ahead-1"></a>13.1. Using MRTG</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1994" /></a><a name="INDEX-1995" /></a><a name="INDEX-1996" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1997" /></a>Before using MRTG, you have to
download and install the software. The primary MRTG web site is
<a href="http://www.mrtg.org/">http://www.mrtg.org</a>. The download
link takes you to a directory maintained by MRTG's inventor and
primary developer, Tobias Oetiker (<a href="http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/pub/">http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/pub/</a>
). This directory contains some older MRTG releases, as well as the
current one. We downloaded the file
<em class="filename">mrtg-2.9.10.tar.gz</em> (the Unix version) from the
list. We will focus on that version in this chapter.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1998" /></a><a name="INDEX-1999" /></a><a name="INDEX-2000" /></a><a name="INDEX-2001" /></a><a name="INDEX-2002" /></a>MRTG requires four third-party packages in
order to run: Perl Version 5.004_5 (at least), and the
<em class="emphasis">gd</em>, <em class="emphasis">libpng</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">zlib</em> libraries. MRTG comes with a Perl-based
implementation of SNMP, so you don't have to worry about
getting and installing any SNMP libraries. You can determine what
version of Perl you have (and whether it's installed) by typing
the command <i class="command">perl -v</i>. This may or may not spit out
a bunch of information. If it does, the first line will be the
version of Perl you have installed. If you get some sort of
"command not found" error, Perl may not be installed. In
any event, go to <a href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com</a> to get the latest version
of Perl.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2003" /></a>The
<em class="emphasis">gd</em> library is used to generate the GIF images
that MRTG displays. You can download it from <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">http://www.boutell.com/gd/</a>. The other two
packages, <em class="emphasis">libpng</em> and <em class="emphasis">zlib</em>,
are also used for various aspects of graphic image creation. They are
available from <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/</a>.
</p><p>

Once you have ensured that Perl, <em class="emphasis">gd</em>,
<em class="emphasis">libpng</em>, and <em class="emphasis">zlib</em> are
installed on your machine, download and unpack the Unix version of
MRTG with the following commands:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[root][linuxserver] &gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>cd /usr/local</b></tt>
[root][linuxserver] &gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>tar -zxvf mrtg-2.9.10.tar.gz</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

Once it's unpacked, <i class="command">cd</i> into the directory it
created (which should be <i class="command">mrtg-2.9.10</i>) and read the
installation hints from the <em class="filename">README</em> file. To
build MRTG, you execute three commands:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>./configure</b></tt>
[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>make </b></tt>
[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>make install</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

All three of these commands produce a lot of output, which we have
omitted. The <i class="command">configure</i> command inspects your
system for tools it needs to build MRTG. It will tell you which items
are missing and where to go to get them. Running
<i class="command">make</i> builds MRTG, but don't bother running
this if the <i class="command">configure</i> command failed; MRTG will
not build unless everything has been installed and configured
properly. Finally, <i class="command">make install</i> installs MRTG and
its associated files in the appropriate places. Again, don't
bother running <i class="command">make install</i> if the previous
<i class="command">make</i> command terminated with errors. The default
location for the MRTG executables is
<em class="filename">/usr/local/mrtg-2/bin</em>. You may want to add this
directory to your search path.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2004" /></a>Once
you've built MRTG, you need to decide where to put the graphs
it generates. Since MRTG's graphs are designed to be viewed by
a web browser, they're often stored in a directory that's
visible to a web server. However, it really doesn't matter
where they go. What's more important is who you want to view
the graphs. You probably don't want the world to see your
network statistics. On a small network, you can place the graphs in a
directory that is out of view of the web server and then use a web
browser to view the HTML reports in the local filesystem. In a larger
network, other people (e.g., other network staff or management) may
need to access the reports; to allow access without publishing your
network statistics to the rest of the world, you may want to set up
some kind of a secure web server. At any rate, the next set of
commands you'll want to execute is something like this:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mkdir /mrtg/images</b></tt>
[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>cp ./images/mrtg*.gif /mrtg/images/</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

The first command creates a directory for storing the graphs MRTG
creates. The second command copies some MRTG images into the newly
created directory for later use in HTML files. For the remainder of
this chapter, we will assume that graphs are stored in
<em class="filename">/mrtg/images</em>.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2005" /></a><a name="INDEX-2006" /></a><a name="INDEX-2007" /></a><a name="INDEX-2008" /></a>You're
now ready to set up your first device to poll, which is called a
<em class="firstterm">target</em> in MRTG. MRTG uses a configuration file
to tell it what devices to poll, what options to apply to the
creation of the graphs it will generate, etc. The syntax of the
configuration file is complex, but MRTG provides a tool called
<i class="command">cfgmaker</i> to help you build it. You'll
probably need to edit the file by hand, but it's much easier to
start with a working template. Here's how to execute
<i class="command">cfgmaker</i>:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>setenv PATH /usr/local/mrtg-2/bin:$PATH</b></tt>
[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>cfgmaker --global 'WorkDir: /mrtg/images' \</b></tt>
<tt class="userinput"><b>--output /mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg public@router</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2009" /></a><a name="INDEX-2010" /></a><a name="INDEX-2011" /></a>The
first argument to <i class="command">cfgmaker</i> sets the
<tt class="literal">WorkDir</tt> variable in the configuration file. This
tells MRTG where to store any data it gathers from the devices
it's going to poll. The second argument specifies where we want
<i class="command">cfgmaker</i> 's output sent; in this case
it's <em class="filename">/mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg</em>. The last argument
specifies the device we want to poll and the community string to use
when polling that device; its format is
<em class="emphasis">community_string@device</em>.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2012" /></a><a name="INDEX-2013" /></a>The output from
<i class="command">cfgmaker</i> is a mix of commands and HTML. It
performs <i class="command">get-next</i> commands on the device you
specified on the command line, in order to get an idea of how many
interfaces your device has, which ones are up, which are down, etc.
It walks the
<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.interfaces</em>
(<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.2</em>) tree to discover the total
number of interfaces in this table. It then creates logical entries
that represent a list of devices to poll, except the list of devices
is actually one device with each interface number specified as a
target. For example, <em class="emphasis">Ethernet0</em> is in the fourth
row of the <em class="emphasis">interfaces</em> table on our Cisco router,
so <i class="command">cfgmaker</i> created a <tt class="literal">Target</tt>
entry called <em class="emphasis">cisco.4</em>. If this interface occupied
the second row in the <em class="emphasis">interfaces</em> table, the
<tt class="literal">Target</tt> entry would be called
<em class="emphasis">cisco.2</em>.
</p><p>

Here's a shortened version of our <em class="filename">mrtg.cfg</em>
file:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">WorkDir: /mrtg/images/

Target[cisco.4]: 4:public@cisco
MaxBytes[cisco.4]: 1250000
Title[cisco.4]: cisco (cisco): Ethernet0
PageTop[cisco.4]: &lt;H1&gt;Traffic Analysis for Ethernet0
 &lt;/H1&gt;
 &lt;TABLE&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;System:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;cisco in Atlanta, Ga&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Maintainer:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Interface:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Ethernet0 (4)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;IP:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;cisco (  )&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Max Speed:&lt;/TD&gt;
       &lt;TD&gt;1250.0 kBytes/s (ethernetCsmacd)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
  &lt;/TABLE&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2014" /></a><a name="INDEX-2015" /></a>It's worth learning a bit
about the format of the configuration file. Comment lines begin with
<tt class="literal">#</tt>; in a real configuration file, you'll see
many of them. Most of the lines in the file are either commands or
snippets of HTML that will be used in MRTG's output files. MRTG
commands take the form of <em class="emphasis">command[key]: options</em>.
For example, the command for the third line is
<tt class="literal">Target</tt>, the key is <tt class="literal">cisco.4</tt>, and
the options are <tt class="literal">4:public@cisco</tt>. The key is an
identifying string that groups entries in the configuration file and
provides a base filename for MRTG to use when generating graphs and
HTML files. At a complex site, MRTG might be used to monitor dozens
of pieces of equipment, with hundreds of interfaces; the key keeps
the configuration file in some semblance of order. The options
provide the actual parameters to the command.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2016" /></a><a name="INDEX-2017" /></a><a name="INDEX-2018" /></a><a name="INDEX-2019" /></a><a name="INDEX-2020" /></a>This should help you understand the
configuration file. The first line specifies the working directory in
which MRTG will place its graphs and HTML files. This is a global
command, so no key is needed. The working directory is typically
somewhere under a web server tree, so that MRTG's reports can
be visible from a web browser. We've set ours to
<tt class="literal">/mrtg/images/</tt>. The third line
(<tt class="literal">Target</tt>) tells MRTG which device it should poll.
The format for this option is
<em class="emphasis">interface:community_string@device</em>, or in our
case <tt class="literal">4:public@cisco</tt>. The device is specified by
its hostname or IP address; we already know about community strings.
Since MRTG is only a data-collection tool, the read-only community
string will suffice. <tt class="literal">Interface</tt> specifies which
interface on the device to poll, according to the device's
<em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>. In this case, we're polling
interface 4 in the <em class="emphasis">ifTable</em>.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2021" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2022" /></a><a name="INDEX-2023" /></a><a name="INDEX-2024" /></a>The
<tt class="literal">MaxBytes</tt> line sets up the maximum value for the
parameters MRTG is going to read from this interface. By default,
MRTG reads <em class="emphasis">ifInOctets</em> and
<em class="emphasis">ifOutOctets</em>. It tries to pick a reasonable
maximum value depending on the interface's type, which it
should be able to read from the device itself. Since this is an
Ethernet interface, MRTG sets <tt class="literal">MaxBytes</tt> to
<tt class="literal">1250000</tt>. The <tt class="literal">Title</tt> specifies
the title for the HTML page generated for the graph. Finally,
<tt class="literal">PageTop</tt> and the following lines tell MRTG what
kind of information to place at the top of the HTML page containing
the usage graphs. The command contains actual HTML code, which was
generated by <i class="command">cfgmaker</i>.
</p><p>

Altogether, this entry tells MRTG to poll for the default objects
(<em class="emphasis">ifInOctets</em> and
<em class="emphasis">ifOutOctets</em>) on entry 4 in the interface table
for the device <em class="emphasis">cisco</em>. Therefore, MRTG will issue
<i class="command">get</i> commands for the OIDs
.<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.4</em>
(<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifInOctets.4</em>
) and .<em class="emphasis">1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.4</em>
(<em class="emphasis">iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifOutOctets.4</em>
). By default, MRTG will generate the following graphs:
</p><p>

<ul><li>
Daily graph with 5-minute averages</p><p>
</li><li>
Weekly graph with 30-minute averages</p><p>
</li><li>
Monthly graph with 2-hour averages</p><p>
</li><li>
Yearly graph with 1-day averages</p><p>
</li></ul>
Once you've finished, try running MRTG by hand to see if there
are any problems with the configuration script:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mrtg /mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2025" /></a><a name="INDEX-2026" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2027" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2028" /></a><a name="INDEX-2029" /></a>If MRTG has no problems with your
configuration file, it will run with no configuration-file errors. If
it does have problems, it will give you a fairly verbose description
of the problem. The first time you run MRTG, it will complain about
not being able to find any log files. If you run MRTG three times
you'll see messages similar to these:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mrtg /mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg</b></tt>
Rateup WARNING: /mrtg/run//rateup could not read the primary log file for cisco.4
Rateup WARNING: /mrtg/run//rateup The backup log file for cisco.4 was invalid as 
well
Rateup WARNING: /mrtg/run//rateup Can't remove cisco.4.old updating log file
Rateup WARNING: /mrtg/run//rateup Can't rename cisco.4.log to cisco.4.old 
updating log file
   
[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mrtg /mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg</b></tt>
Rateup WARNING: /mrtg/run//rateup Can't remove cisco.4.old updating log file

[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mrtg /mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg</b></tt>
[root][linuxserver] ~/mrtg-2.9.10&gt;</pre></blockquote>

As you can see, the first time we ran the program it spat out some
errors. The second run produced only one error, and the last time it
ran with no errors. These errors are normal when you run MRTG for the
first time; don't worry about them.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2030" /></a>The next step is to make sure MRTG runs
every five minutes. There's no need for MRTG to be run by root;
any user will do. Add a line like the following to the
<em class="filename">crontab</em> entry for the appropriate user:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">*/5 * * * * /usr/local/mrtg-2/bin/mrtg /mrtg/run/mrtg.cfg </pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2031" /></a>This
runs MRTG every five minutes of every day. Note that the
<tt class="literal">*/5</tt> notation is Linux-specific; on other Unix
systems you'll have to specify the times explicitly
(<tt class="literal">0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55</tt>). If your
network is fairly large, you might run into problems if MRTG does not
finish all its polling duties before the next polling cycle starts.
If this is the case, setting a five-minute poll interval may not be a
good idea. You may have to experiment to determine a good interval
for your environment. <a name="INDEX-2032" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2033" /></a>
