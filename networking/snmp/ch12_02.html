<h2 class="sect1">12.2. Who's Logging into My Machine? (I-Am-in)</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1889" /><a name="INDEX-1890" /><a name="INDEX-1891" /><a name="INDEX-1892" /><a name="INDEX-1893" />When Unix users log in, the system
automatically executes a profile; for users of the Bourne, Korn, or
<em class="emphasis">bash</em> shells, the systemwide profile is named
<em class="filename">/etc/profile</em>. There's a similar file for
users of <em class="emphasis">csh</em> and <em class="emphasis">tcsh</em>
(<em class="filename">/etc/login</em>). We can use SNMP to record logins
by adding a trap to these profiles. By itself this isn't all
that interesting, because Unix already keeps a log of user logins.
But let's say that you're monitoring a few dozen machines
and don't want to check each machine's log. Adding a trap
to the systemwide profile lets you monitor logins to all your systems
from one place. It also makes your logging more secure. It's
not too difficult for an intelligent user to delete the
<em class="filename">wtmp</em> file that stores Unix login records. Using
SNMP to do the logging stores the information on another host, over
which you should have better control.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-64">[64]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-64" />[64]Yes, a clever
user could intercept and modify SNMP packets, or rewrite the shell
profile, or do any number of things to defeat logging. We're
not really interested in making it impossible to defeat logging; we
just want to make it more difficult.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1894" /><a name="INDEX-1895" />To generate the trap, invoke the
external program <em class="filename">/opt/local/mib_
programs/os/iamin</em> in <em class="filename">/etc/profile</em>
(you can call the same program within
<em class="filename">/etc/login</em>). Here is the code for
<em class="filename">iamin</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#
# Filename: /opt/local/mib_programs/os/iamin 

chomp ($WHO = `/bin/who am i \| awk \{\'print \$1\'\}`);

exit 123 unless ($WHO ne '');

chomp ($WHOAMI = `/usr/ucb/whoami`);
chomp ($TTY = `/bin/tty`);
chomp ($FROM = `/bin/last \-1 $WHO \| /bin/awk \{\'print \$3\'\}`);

if ($FROM =~ /Sun|Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat/) { $FROM = "N/A"; }

# DEBUG BELOW
# print "WHO :$WHO:\n"; print "WHOAMI :$WHOAMI:\n"; print "FROM :$FROM:\n";

if ("$WHOAMI" ne "$WHO") { $WHO = "$WHO\-\&gt;$WHOAMI"; }

print "##############\n\n";</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1896" />
<a name="INDEX-1897" />This script is a bit meatier than
expected because we need to weed out a number of bogus entries. For
instance, many programs run within a shell and hence invoke the same
shell profiles. Therefore, we have to figure out whether the profile
is being invoked by a human user; if not, we quit.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-65">[65]</a>
The next step is to figure out more about the user's identity;
i.e., where she is logging in from and what her real identity
is -- we don't want to be confused by someone who uses
<i class="command">su</i> to switch to another identity. The third part
of the program sends the trap with all the newly found information
(who the user is, the host from which she is logging in, and what TTY
she is on). We've included trap-generation code using the
Net-SNMP utilities, the native Perl module, and OpenView's
utilities. Take your pick and use the version with which you're
most comfortable. The last portion of this program tells the user
that she has been logged.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-65" />[65]This will also fail if the user is
<i class="command">su</i>'ing to another user. In a well-designed
environment, users really shouldn't have to
<i class="command">su</i> all that often -- using
<i class="command">sudo</i> or designing appropriate groups should
greatly reduce the need to <i class="command">su</i>.</p> </blockquote>

This script isn't without its problems. The user can always
break out of the script before it is done, bypassing logging. You can
counter this attempt by using <em class="emphasis">trap</em>(1), which
responds to different signals. This forces the user to complete this
program, not letting her stop in midstream. This strategy creates its
own problems, since the root user doesn't have any way to
bypass the check. In a sense, this is good: we want to be
particularly careful about root logins. But what happens if
you're trying to investigate a network failure or DNS problem?
In this case, the script will hang while DNS tries to look up the
host from which you're logging in. This can be very
frustrating. Before implementing a script like this, look at your
environment and decide which profiles you should lock.
</p>

Any of the packages for receiving traps can be used to listen for the
traps generated by this program.
