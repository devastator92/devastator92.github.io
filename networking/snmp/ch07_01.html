By this time you should understand what an SNMP agent is: it's
nothing more than software that lives on the device you want to
monitor. It responds to requests from the NMS and generates traps.
This chapter discusses how to configure agents. It starts by defining
some standard configuration parameters that are common to all SNMP
agents, then goes into some advanced parameters you might run into
when configuring your equipment. The bulk of this chapter walks
through the configuration for a number of common devices, paying
attention to security issues.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="enettdg-CHP-7-SECT-1" /></a> 
  <h2 class="sect1"><a name="ahead-1"></a>7.1. Parameter Settings</h2>

<a name="INDEX-857" /></a><a name="INDEX-858" /></a><a name="INDEX-859" /></a><a name="INDEX-860" /></a>All SNMP devices share the following
common configurable parameters:
</p><p>

<ul><li>
<em class="emphasis">sysLocation</em></p><p>
</li><li>
<em class="emphasis">sysContact</em></p><p>
</li><li>
<em class="emphasis">sysName</em></p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-861" /></a><a name="INDEX-862" /></a><a name="INDEX-863" /></a>Read-write and read-only
access community strings (and frequently, a trap community string)
</p><p>
</li><li>
Trap destination </p><p>
</li></ul>
<em class="emphasis">sysLocation</em> is the physical location for the
device being monitored. Its definition in RFC 1213
is:<a name="INDEX-864" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-865" /></a><a name="INDEX-866" /></a>
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sysLocation OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
    ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet,
         3rd floor')."
    ::= { system 6 }</pre></blockquote>

As you can see, its <tt class="literal">SYNTAX</tt> is
<tt class="literal">DisplayString</tt>, which means it can be an ASCII
string of characters; its size is declared to be at most 255
characters. This particular object is useful for determining where a
device is located. This kind of practical information is essential in
a large network, particularly if it's spread over a wide area.
If you have a misbehaving switch, it's very convenient to be
able to look up the switch's physical location. Unfortunately,
<em class="emphasis">sysLocation</em> frequently isn't set when the
device is installed and even more often isn't changed when the
device is moved. Unreliable information is worse than no information,
so use some discipline and keep your devices up to date.
</p><p>

RFC 1213's definition of <em class="emphasis">sysContact</em> is
similar to that of
<em class="emphasis">sysLocation</em>:<a name="INDEX-867" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-868" /></a>
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sysContact OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
    ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The textual identification of the contact person for this managed
         node, together with information on how to contact this person."
    ::= { system 4 }</pre></blockquote>

<em class="emphasis">sysContact</em> is a
<tt class="literal">DisplayString</tt>. It's fairly obvious what
it's used for: it identifies the primary contact for the device
in question. It is important to set this object with an appropriate
value, as it can help your operations staff determine who needs to be
contacted in the event of some catastrophic failure. You can also use
it to make sure you're notified, if you're responsible
for a given device, when someone needs to take your device down for
maintenance or repairs. As with <em class="emphasis">sysLocation</em>,
make sure to keep this information up to date as your staff changes.
It's not uncommon to find devices for which the
<em class="emphasis">sysContact</em> is someone who left the company
several years ago.
</p><p>

<em class="emphasis">sysName</em><a name="INDEX-869" /></a><a name="INDEX-870" /></a><a name="INDEX-871" /></a><a name="INDEX-872" /></a><a name="INDEX-873" /></a><a name="INDEX-874" /></a> should be set to the
<em class="firstterm">fully-qualified domain name</em> (FQDN) for the
managed device. In other words, it's the hostname associated
with the managed device's IP address. The RFC 1213 definition
follows:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sysName OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
    ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By
         convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name."
    ::= { system 5 }</pre></blockquote>

The <a name="INDEX-875" /></a> <a name="INDEX-876" /></a>read-only and read-write parameters are
the community strings for read-only and read-write access. Notice
that <em class="emphasis">sysLocation</em>,
<em class="emphasis">sysContact</em>, and <em class="emphasis">sysName</em> all
have <tt class="literal">ACCESS</tt> values of
<tt class="literal">read-write</tt>. With the appropriate read-write
community string, anyone can change the definition of these objects
and many more objects of significantly greater importance.
Ultimately, it's not a huge problem if somebody maliciously
makes your router lie about its location -- you probably already
know that it isn't located in Antarctica. But someone who can
do this can also fiddle with your routing tables and do other kinds
of much more serious damage. Someone who has only the read-only
community string can certainly find out more information about your
network than you would like to reveal to an outsider. Setting the
community strings is extremely important to maintaining a secure
environment. Most devices are shipped with default community strings
that are well known. Don't assume that you can put off setting
your community strings until later.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-877" /></a><a name="INDEX-878" /></a><a name="INDEX-879" /></a>The trap destination parameters specify
the addresses to which traps are sent. There's nothing really
magical here -- since traps are asynchronous notifications
generated by your devices, the agent needs to know who should receive
notification. Many devices support authentication-failure traps,
which are generated if someone attempts to access them using
incorrect community strings. This feature is extremely useful, as it
allows you to detect attempts to break into your devices. Many
devices also support the ability to include a community string with
traps; you can configure the network-management station to respond
only to traps that contain the proper community string.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-880" /></a>Many devices have additional
twists on the access and trap parameters. For example, Cisco devices
allow you to create different community strings for different parts
of the MIB -- you can use this to allow people to set some
variables, but not others. Many vendors allow you to place
restrictions on the hosts that are allowed to make SNMP requests.
That is, the device will respond only to requests from certain IP
addresses, regardless of the community string.
</p><p>

The range of configuration options you're likely to run into is
limited only by the imagination of the vendors, so it's
obviously impossible for us to describe everything you might
encounter. <a href="ch07_03.html#enettdg-CHP-7-SECT-3">Section 7.3, "Agent Configuration Walkthroughs"</a> later in
this chapter will give you an idea of how some agents implement the
standard configuration parameters and a little insight into what
other features might be available. <a name="INDEX-881" /></a><a name="INDEX-882" /></a><a name="INDEX-883" /></a><a name="INDEX-884" /></a>
