<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>








Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>

The animals on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Essential SNMP</em> are red deer (<em class="emphasis">Cervus
elaphus</em>). Male red deer, also known as stags or harts, can grow to
over 400 lbs. and stand 42-54 inches tall at the shoulder. Females, or
<em>hinds</em>, are more slightly built and usually reach a weight of only
about 200 lbs. The color of the red deer's coat ranges from a warm
reddish-brown in the summer to a darker grayish-brown in
winter. Calves are spotted at birth, but the spots fade after about
two months.</p>


The typical family group consists of a hind, a new calf, a
yearling calf, and perhaps a 2-3 year old stag. Mature stags and hinds
live in separate groups for most of the year, with the hinds tending
to monopolize the better, more grassy habitats. At the start of the
mating season (the rut) in the early fall, the stags split up and join
the females. Each eligible stag establishes a harem of up to 20 or
more hinds, which he defends vigorously during the rut. During this
period, which typically lasts 6-8 weeks, the stags often forego eating
and can lose as much as 15% of their body mass.</p>

 
Red deer are one of the most widely distributed deer species:
though they are native to Europe, today they can be found everywhere
from New Zealand to North America. They are herbivores, feeding mainly
on rough grasses, young tree shoots, and shrubs. Forest-dwellers by
nature, they can adapt easily to different climates and terrain. In
many of the areas in which they were introduced red deer are
commercially farmed for venison and antler velvet, which has been used
in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years to treat a broad
range of ailments including anemia, arthritic pain and rheumatism,
kidney disorders, and stress.</p>

Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a
series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century
engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the
cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond
font.</p>

 
David Futato designed the interior layout based on a series design by Nancy Priest. Neil Walls converted the files from Microsoft Word to FrameMaker 5.5.6 using tools created by Mike Sierra. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book; the code font is Constant Willison. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Rachel Wheeler.</p>
