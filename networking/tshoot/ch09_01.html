<a name="INDEX-2247" /></a><a name="INDEX-2248" /></a><a name="INDEX-2249" /></a>This chapter and the next describe tools
used to investigate protocol-specific behavior. In this chapter, I
describe tools used to explore connectivity protocols, protocols that
work at the network and transport levels to provide connectivity.
<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Application-Level Tools"</a> focuses on tools used in testing
protocols at the application level.
</p><p>

I begin with a description of packet generation tools. Custom packet
generators, like <em class="filename">hping</em> and
<em class="filename">nemesis</em>, will allow you to create custom packets
to test protocols. Load generators, like <em class="filename">MGEN</em>,
will let you flood your network with packets to see how your network
responds to the additional traffic. We conclude with a brief
discussion of network emulators and simulators.
</p><p>

Many of the tools described in this chapter and the next are not
tools that you will need often, if ever. But should the need arise,
you will want to know about them. Some of these tools are described
quite briefly. My goal is to familiarize you with the tools rather
than to provide a detailed introduction. Unless you have a specific
need for one of these tools, you'll probably want to just skim
these chapters initially. Should the need arise, you'll know
the appropriate tool exists and can turn to the references for more
information.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="nettroubletools-CHP-9-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">9.1. Packet Injection Tools</h2>

<a name="INDEX-2250" /></a><a name="INDEX-2251" /></a><a name="INDEX-2252" /></a><a name="INDEX-2253" /></a>This first group of tools generates and
injects packets into your network. Basically, there are two different
purposes for generating packets, each with its own general approach
and its own set of tools.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2254" /></a><a name="INDEX-2255" /></a><a name="INDEX-2256" /></a>First, to test software configuration and
protocols, it may be necessary to control the content of individual
fields within packets. For example, customized packets can be
essential to test whether a firewall is performing correctly. They
can also be used to investigate problems with specific protocols or
to collect information such as path MTU. They are wonderful learning
tools, but using them can be a lot of work and will require a very
detailed knowledge of the relevant protocols.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2257" /></a><a name="INDEX-2258" /></a><a name="INDEX-2259" /></a>The second reason for generating
packets is to test performance. For this purpose, you typically
generate a large number of packets to see how your network or devices
on the network respond to the increased load. We have already done
some of this. In <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Path Characteristics"</a>, we looked at tools
that generated streams of packets to analyze link and path
performance. Basically, any network benchmark will have a packet
generator as a component. Typically, however, you won't have
much control over this component. The tools described here give you
much greater control over the number, size, and spacing of packets.
Unlike custom packet generators, load generators typically
won't provide much control over the contents of the packets.
</p><p>

These two uses are best thought of as extremes on a continuum rather
than mutually exclusive categories. Some programs lie somewhere
between these two extremes, providing a moderate degree of control
over packet contents and the functionality to generate multiple
packets. There is no one ideal tool, so you may want to become
familiar with several, depending on your needs.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-9-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.1.1. Custom Packets Generators</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2260" /></a><a name="INDEX-2261" /></a><a name="INDEX-2262" /></a>A number of different programs will
construct custom packets for you. The utilities vary considerably in
the amount of control you actually have. As all require a thorough
understanding of the underlying protocols, none of these tools are
particularly easy to use. All of the ones I am familiar with are
command-line programs. This is really a plus since, if you find
yourself using these programs heavily, you will want to call them
from scripts.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2263" /></a><a name="INDEX-2264" /></a>Two programs,
<em class="filename">hping</em> and <em class="filename">nemesis</em>, are
briefly described here. A number of additional tools are cited at the
end of this section in case these utilities don't provide the
exact functionality you want or aren't easily ported to your
system. Of the two, <em class="filename">hping</em> is probably the better
known, but <em class="filename">nemesis</em> has features that recommend
it. Neither is perfect.
</p><p>

Generally, once you have the idea of how to use one of these tools,
learning another is simply a matter of identifying the options of
interest. Most custom packet generators have a reasonable set of
defaults that you can start with. Depending on what you want to do,
you select the appropriate options to change just what is
necessary -- ideally as little as possible.
</p><p>

Custom packet tools have a mixed reputation. They are extremely
powerful tools and, as such, can be abused. And some of their authors
seem to take great pride in this potential. These are definitely
tools that you should use with care. For some purposes, such as
testing firewalls, they can be indispensable. Just make sure it is
your firewall, and not someone else's, that you are testing.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-9-SECT-1.1.1" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.1.1.1. hping</h3>

<em class="filename">hping</em><a name="INDEX-2265" /></a><a name="INDEX-2266" /></a><a name="INDEX-2267" /></a>, or
<em class="filename">hping2</em> as it is sometimes called, was written by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. The documentation is a little rough at times
and suggests uses that are inappropriate. Nonetheless, it is a
powerful, versatile program.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2268" /></a>When run with the default parameters, it
looks a lot like <em class="filename">ping</em> and is useful for checking
connectivity:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">lnx1# hping 205.153.63.30
eth0 default routing interface selected (according to /proc)
HPING 205.153.63.30 (eth0 205.153.63.30): NO FLAGS are set, 40 headers + 0 data

46 bytes from 205.153.63.30: flags=RA seq=4 ttl=126 id=3090 win=0 rtt=4.5 ms

--- 205.153.63.30 hping statistic ---
5 packets tramitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 4.4/4.7/5.5 ms</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2269" /></a><a name="INDEX-2270" /></a><a name="INDEX-2271" /></a><a name="INDEX-2272" /></a><a name="INDEX-2273" /></a>At first glance, the output looks almost
identical to <em class="filename">ping</em>'s. Actually, by default,
<em class="filename">hping</em> does not send ICMP packets. It sends TCP
packets to port 0. (You can change ports with the
<em class="filename">-p</em> option.) Since this port is almost never
used, most systems will reply with a RESET message. Consequently,
<em class="filename">hping</em> will sometimes get responses from systems
that block <em class="filename">ping</em>. On the other hand, it may
trigger intrusion detection systems as well. If you want to mimic
<em class="filename">ping</em>, you can use the <em class="filename">-1</em>
argument, which specifies ICMP. Or, if you prefer, you can use
<em class="filename">-2</em> to send UDP packets.
</p><p>

When using ICMP, this is what one of the replies from the output
looks like:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">46 bytes from 205.153.63.30: icmp_seq=0 ttl=126 id=53524 rtt=2.2 ms</pre></blockquote>

Otherwise, the output will be almost identical to the default
behavior.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2274" /></a>If you want more information, you can use
<em class="filename">-V</em> for verbose mode. Here is what a reply looks
like with this option:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">46 bytes from 172.16.2.236: flags=RA seq=0 ttl=63 id=12961 win=0 rtt=1.0 ms
              tos =          0 len =         40
              seq =          0 ack =  108515096
              sum =       a5bc urp =          0</pre></blockquote>

There is also a debug mode if you are having problems with
<em class="filename">hping</em>.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2275" /></a><a name="INDEX-2276" /></a><a name="INDEX-2277" /></a><a name="INDEX-2278" /></a>Other options that control the general
behavior of <em class="filename">hping</em> include
<em class="filename">-c</em> to set the number of packets to send,
<em class="filename">-i</em> to set the time between packets,
<em class="filename">-n</em> for numeric output (no name resolution), and
<em class="filename">-q</em> for quiet output (just summary lines when
done).
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2279" /></a><a name="INDEX-2280" /></a><a name="INDEX-2281" /></a>Another group of options allows you to
control the contents of the packet header. For example, the
<em class="filename">-a</em> option can be used to specify an arbitrary
source address for a packet. Here is an example:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">lnx1# hping2 -a 205.153.63.30 172.16.2.236
eth0 default routing interface selected (according to /proc)
HPING 172.16.2.236 (eth0 172.16.2.236): NO FLAGS are set, 40 headers + 0 data 
bytes

--- 172.16.2.236 hping statistic ---
4 packets tramitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.0/0.0/0.0 ms</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2282" /></a><a name="INDEX-2283" /></a><a name="INDEX-2284" /></a>In this case, the packet has been
sent from a computer whose actual source address is
<em class="emphasis">172.16.3.234</em>. The packet, however, will have
<em class="emphasis">205.153.63.30</em> in its IP header as the source
address. Of course, any reply from the destination will go back to
the spoofed source address, not the actual source address. If this a
valid address that belongs to someone else, they may not look kindly
on your testing.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2285" /></a><a name="INDEX-2286" /></a><a name="INDEX-2287" /></a>Spoofing source
addresses can be useful when testing router and firewall setup, but
you should do this in a controlled environment. All routers should be
configured to drop any packets with invalid source addresses. That
is, if a packet claims to have a source that is not on the local
network or that is not from a device for which the local network
should be forwarding a packet, then the source address is illegal and
the packet should be dropped. By creating packets with illegal source
addresses, you can test your routers to be sure they are, in fact,
dropping these packets. Of course, you need to use a tool like
<em class="filename">ethereal</em> or <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> to see
what is getting through and what is blocked.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-36">[36]</a>
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-36" /></a>[36]<a name="INDEX-2288" /></a>If this is all you are testing, you may
prefer to use a specialized tool like
<em class="filename">egressor</em>.</p><p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2289" /></a><a name="INDEX-2290" /></a>The source port can be changed with the
<em class="filename">-s</em> option. The TTL field can be set with the
<em class="filename">-t</em> option. There are options to set the various
TCP flags: <em class="filename">-A</em> for ACK, <em class="filename">-F</em>
for FIN, <em class="filename">-P</em> for PUSH, <em class="filename">-R</em>
for RST, <em class="filename">-S</em> for SYN, and <em class="filename">-U</em>
for URG. Oddly, although you can set the urgent flag, there
doesn't seem to be a way to set the urgent pointer. You can set
the packet size with the <em class="filename">-d</em> option, set the TCP
header length with the <em class="filename">-O</em> option, and read the
packet's data from a file with the <em class="filename">-E</em>
option. Here is an example of sending a DNS packet using data in the
file <em class="filename">data.dns</em>:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# hping -2 -p 53 -E data.dns -d 31 205.153.63.30</pre></blockquote>

<em class="filename">hping</em> generated an error on my system with this
command, but the packet was sent correctly.
</p><p>

Be warned, constructing a usable data file is nontrivial. Here is a
crude C program that will construct the data needed for this DNS
example:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main(  )
{
FILE *fp;

fp=fopen("data.dns", "w");
fprintf(fp, "%c%c%c%c", 0x00, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00);
fprintf(fp, "%c%c%c%c", 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00);
fprintf(fp, "%c%c%c%c", 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00);
fprintf(fp, "%c%s", 0x03, "www");
fprintf(fp, "%c%s", 0x05, "cisco");
fprintf(fp, "%c%s%c", 0x03, "com", 0x00);
fprintf(fp, "%c%c%c%c", 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01);
fclose(fp);
}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2291" /></a>Even if you don't use C, it
should be fairly clear how this works. The <em class="filename">fopen</em>
command creates the file, and the <em class="filename">fprintf</em>
commands write out the data. <em class="filename">%c</em> and
<em class="filename">%s</em> are used to identify the datatype when
formatting the output. The remaining arguments are the actual values
for the data. (I'm sure there are cleaner ways to create this
data, but this will work.)
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2292" /></a><a name="INDEX-2293" /></a>Finally, <em class="filename">hping</em> can
also be put in dump mode so that the contents of the reply packets
are displayed in hex:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# hping -c 1 -j 172.16.2.230
HPING 172.16.2.230 (ep0 172.16.2.230): NO FLAGS are set, 40 headers + 0 data 
bytes
46 bytes from 172.16.2.230: flags=RA seq=0 ttl=128 id=60017 win=0 rtt=2.1 ms
                0060 9706 2222 0060 088f 5f0e 0800 4500

--- 172.16.2.230 hping statistic ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 2.1/2.1/2.1 ms</pre></blockquote>

Numerous other options are described in
<em class="filename">hping</em>'s documentation. You can get a very
handy summary of options if you run <em class="filename">hping</em> with
the <em class="filename">-h</em> option. I strongly recommend you print
this to use while you are learning the program.<a name="INDEX-2294" /></a><a name="INDEX-2295" /></a><a name="INDEX-2296" /></a>

<em class="filename">nemesis</em><a name="INDEX-2297" /></a><a name="INDEX-2298" /></a><a name="INDEX-2299" /></a><a name="INDEX-2300" /></a><a name="INDEX-2301" /></a><a name="INDEX-2302" /></a><a name="INDEX-2303" /></a><a name="INDEX-2304" /></a><a name="INDEX-2305" /></a><a name="INDEX-2306" /></a>, whose author is identified only as
Obecian in the documentation, is actually a family of closely related
command-line tools designed to generate packets. They are
<em class="filename">nemesis-arp</em>, <em class="filename">nemesis-dns</em>,
<em class="filename">nemesis-icmp</em>, <em class="filename">nemesis-igmp</em>,
<em class="filename">nemesis-ospf</em>, <em class="filename">nemesis-rip</em>,
<em class="filename">nemesis-tcp</em>, and
<em class="filename">nemesis-udp</em>. Each, as you might guess, is
designed to construct and send a particular type of packet. The
inclusion of support for protocols like OSPF or IGMP really sets
<em class="filename">nemesis</em> apart from similar tools.
</p><p>

Here is an example that sends a TCP packet:</p><p>

<em class="filename">-v</em> option is for verbose mode. Without this
option, the program sends the packet but displays nothing on the
screen. Use this option to test your commands and then omit it when
you embed the commands in scripts. The <em class="filename">-S</em> and
<em class="filename">-D</em> options give the source and destination
addresses. You can use the <em class="filename">-x</em> and
<em class="filename">-y</em> to set source and destination ports. If you
want to specify flags, you can use the <em class="filename">-f</em>
option. For example, if you add <em class="filename">-fS -fA</em> to the
command line, the SYN and ACK flags will be set. (Many firewalls will
block packets with some combinations of SYN and ACK flags but will
pass packets with different combinations. Being able to set the SYN
and ACK flags can be useful in testing these firewalls.)
</p><p>

Here is an example setting the SYN and ACK flags and the destination
port:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# nemesis-tcp -S 172.16.2.236 -D 205.153.63.30 -fS -fA -y 22</pre></blockquote>

Notice the program performs silently without the
<em class="filename">-v</em> option. A number of additional options are
described in the Unix manpages.
</p><p>

The other programs in the <em class="filename">nemesis</em> suite work
pretty much the same way. Here is an example for sending an ICMP ECHO
REQUEST:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# nemesis-icmp -v -S 172.16.2.236 -D 205.153.63.30 -i 8

The <em class="filename">-i</em> option specifies the type field in the
ICMP header. In this case, the <em class="filename">8</em> is the code for
an ECHO_REQUEST message. The destination should respond with an
ECHO_REPLY.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2315" /></a>The <em class="filename">-P</em> option can
be used to read the data for the packet from a file. For example,
here is the syntax to send a DNS query.

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# ipsend -v -i ep0 -g 172.16.2.1 -d 205.153.63.30
Device:  ep0
Source:  172.16.2.236
Dest:    205.153.63.30
Gateway: 172.16.2.1
mtu:     1500</pre></blockquote>

<em class="filename">ipsend</em> is not the most versatile of tools, but
depending on what system you are using, you may already have it
installed.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2327" /></a><a name="INDEX-2328" /></a>Yet
another program worth considering is <em class="filename">sock</em>.
<em class="filename">sock</em> is described in the first volume of Richard
W. Stevens' <em class="emphasis">TCP/Illustrated</em> and is freely
downloadable. While <em class="filename">sock</em> doesn't give the
range of control some of these other programs give, it is a nice
pedagogical tool for learning about TCP/IP. Beware, there are other
totally unrelated programs called <em class="filename">sock</em>.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2329" /></a><a name="INDEX-2330" /></a><a name="INDEX-2331" /></a><a name="INDEX-2332" /></a><a name="INDEX-2333" /></a>Finally, some sniffers and
analyzers support the capture and retransmission of packets. Look at
the documentation for the sniffer you are using, particularly if it
is a commercial product. If you decide to use this feature, proceed
with care. Retransmission of traffic, if used indiscriminately, can
create some severe problems.<a name="INDEX-2334" /></a><a name="INDEX-2335" /></a><a name="INDEX-2336" /></a> 
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-9-SIDEBAR-1" /></a><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">socket and netcat</h4>

<a name="INDEX-2337" /></a><a name="INDEX-2338" /></a><a name="INDEX-2339" /></a><a name="INDEX-2340" /></a>While they don't fit cleanly into
this or the next category, <em class="filename">netcat</em> (or
<em class="filename">nc</em>) and Juergen Nickelsen's
<em class="filename">socket</em> are worth mentioning. (The
<em class="emphasis">netcat</em> documentation identifies only the author
as Hobbit.) Both are programs that can be used to establish a
connection between two machines. They are useful for debugging,
moving files, and exploring and learning about TCP/IP. Both can be
used from scripts.
</p><p>

You'll need to start one copy as a server (in listen mode) on
one computer:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# nc -l -p 2000</pre></blockquote>

Then start another as a client on a second computer:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# nc 172.16.2.231 2000</pre></blockquote>

Here is the equivalent command for <em class="filename">socket</em> as a
server:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# socket -s 2000</pre></blockquote>

Here is the equivalent command for a client:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# socket 172.16.2.231 2000</pre></blockquote>

In all examples <tt class="literal">2000</tt> is an arbitrarily selected
port number.
</p><p>

Here is a simple example using <em class="filename">nc</em> to copy a file
from one system to another. The server is opened with output
redirected to a file:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# nc -l -p 2000 &gt; tmp</pre></blockquote>

Then the file is piped to the client:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# cat README | nc 172.16.2.231 2000
^C punt!</pre></blockquote>

Finally, <em class="filename">nc</em> is terminated with a Ctrl-C. The
contents of <em class="filename">README</em> on <em class="filename">bsd1</em>
have been copied to the file <em class="filename">tmp</em> on
<em class="filename">bsd2</em>. These programs can be cleaner than
<em class="filename">telnet</em> in some testing situations since, unlike
<em class="filename">telnet</em>, they don't attempt any session
negotiations when started. Play with them, and you are sure to find a
number of other uses.

<h3 class="sect2">9.1.2. Load Generators</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2341" /></a><a name="INDEX-2342" /></a><a name="INDEX-2343" /></a><a name="INDEX-2344" /></a>When
compared to custom packet generators, load generators are at the
opposite extreme of the continuum for packet injectors. These are
programs that generate traffic to stress-test a network or devices on
a network. These tools can help you judge the performance of your
network or diagnose problems. They can also produce a considerable
strain on your network. You should use these tools to test systems
offline, perhaps in a testing laboratory prior to deployment or
during scheduled downtime. Extreme care should be taken before using
these tools on a production network. Unless you are absolutely
convinced that what you are doing is safe and reasonable, don't
use these tools on production networks.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2345" /></a><a name="INDEX-2346" /></a><a name="INDEX-2347" /></a>Almost any application can be used to
generate traffic. A few tools, such as <em class="filename">ping</em> and
<em class="filename">ttcp</em>, are particularly easy to use for this
purpose. For example, by starting multiple <em class="filename">ping</em>
sessions in the background, by varying the period between packets
with the <em class="filename">-i</em> option, and by varying the packet
sizes with the <em class="filename">-s</em> option, you can easily
generate a wide range of traffic loads. Unfortunately, this
won't generate the type of traffic you may need for some types
of tests. Two tools<em class="filename">, spray</em> and
<em class="filename">mgen,</em> are described here. The better known of
these is probably <em class="filename">spray</em>. (It was introduced in
<a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Path Characteristics"</a>.) It is also frequently included with
systems so you may already have a copy. <em class="filename">mgen</em> is
one of the most versatile.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-9-SECT-1.2.1" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.1.2.1. spray</h3>

<em class="filename">spray</em><a name="INDEX-2348" /></a><a name="INDEX-2349" /></a><a name="INDEX-2350" /></a><a name="INDEX-2351" /></a><a name="INDEX-2352" /></a><a name="INDEX-2353" /></a> is
useful in getting a rough idea of a computer's network
performance, particularly its interface. <em class="filename">spray</em>,
on the local computer, communicates with the
<em class="filename">rpc.sprayd</em> daemon on the remote system being
tested. (You'll need to make sure this is running on the remote
system.) It effectively floods the remote system with a large number
of fixed-length UDP packets. The remote daemon, generally started by
<em class="filename">inetd</em>, receives and counts these packets. The
local copy of <em class="filename">spray</em> queries the remote daemon to
determine the number of packets that were successfully received. By
comparing the number of packets sent to the number received,
<em class="filename">spray</em> can calculate the number of packets lost.
</p><p>

Here is an example of <em class="filename">spray</em> using default values:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# spray sol1
sending 1162 packets of lnth 86 to 172.16.2.233 ...
        in 0.12 seconds elapsed time
        191 packets (16.44%) dropped
Sent:   9581 packets/sec, 804.7K bytes/sec
Rcvd:   8006 packets/sec, 672.4K bytes/sec</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2354" /></a><a name="INDEX-2355" /></a><a name="INDEX-2356" /></a><a name="INDEX-2357" /></a><a name="INDEX-2358" /></a>Command-line options allow you
to set the number of packets sent (<em class="filename">-c</em>), the
length of the packets sent (<em class="filename">-l </em>), and a delay
between packets in microseconds (<em class="filename">-d </em>).
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2359" /></a><a name="INDEX-2360" /></a>You
should not be alarmed that packets are being dropped. The idea is to
send packets as fast as possible so that the interface will be
stressed and packets will be lost. <em class="filename">spray</em> is most
useful in comparing the performance of two machines. For example, you
might want to see if your server can keep up with your clients. To
test this, you'll want to use <em class="filename">spray</em> to
send packets from the client to the server. If the number of packets
dropped is about the same, the machines are fairly evenly matched. If
a client is able to overwhelm a server, then you may have a potential
problem.
</p><p>

In the previous example, <em class="filename">spray</em> was run on
<em class="filename">bsd2</em>, flooding <em class="filename">sol1</em>. Here
are the results of running <em class="filename">spray</em> on
<em class="filename">sol1</em>, flooding <em class="filename">bsd2 </em>:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sol1# spray bsd2
sending 1162 packets of length 86 to 172.16.2.236 ...
        610 packets (52.496%) dropped by 172.16.2.236
        36 packets/sec, 3144 bytes/sec</pre></blockquote>

Clearly, <em class="filename">sol1</em> is faster than
<em class="filename">bsd2</em> since <em class="filename">bsd2</em> is dropping
a much larger percentage of packets.
</p><p>

Unfortunately, while <em class="filename">spray</em> can alert you to a
problem, it is unable to differentiate among the various reasons why
a packet was lost -- collision, slow interface, lack of buffer
space, and so on. The obvious things to look at are the speed of the
computer and its interfaces.

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-9-SECT-1.2.2" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.1.2.2. MGEN</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2361" /></a><a name="INDEX-2362" /></a><a name="INDEX-2363" /></a><a name="INDEX-2364" /></a>The
Multi-Generator Toolset or MGEN is actually a collection of tools for
generating traffic, receiving traffic, and analyzing results. The
work of Brian Adamson at the Naval Research Laboratory, this
sophisticated set of tools will give you a high degree of control
over the shape of the traffic you generate. However, you aren't
given much control over the actual UDP packets the utility
sends -- that's not the intent of the tool. For its intended
uses, however, you have all the control you are likely to need.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2365" /></a>The traffic generation tool is
<em class="filename">mgen</em>. It can be run in command-line mode or by
using the <em class="filename">-g</em> option in graphical mode. At its
simplest, it can be used with command-line options to generate
traffic. Here is a simple example:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# mgen -i ep0 -b 205.153.63.30:2000 -r 10 -s 64 -d 5

MGEN: Version 3.1a3
MGEN: Loading event queue ...
MGEN: Seeding random number generator ...
MGEN: Beginning packet generation ...
      (Hit &lt;CTRL-C&gt; to stop)Trying to set IP_TOS = 0x0
MGEN: Packets Tx'd       :       50
MGEN: Transmission period:     5.018 seconds.
MGEN: Ave Tx pkt rate    :     9.964 pps.
MGEN: Interface Stats    :      ep0
             Frames Tx'd :       55
               Tx Errors :        0
              Collisions :        0
MGEN: Done.</pre></blockquote>

In this case, 10 packets per second for 5 seconds yields 50 packets.</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2366" /></a><a name="INDEX-2367" /></a><a name="INDEX-2368" /></a><a name="INDEX-2369" /></a><a name="INDEX-2370" /></a>Other options for
<em class="filename">mgen</em> include setting the interface
(<em class="filename">-i</em>), the destination address and port
(<em class="filename">-b</em>), the packet rate (<em class="filename">-r</em>),
the packet size (<em class="filename">-s</em>), and the duration of the
flow in seconds (<em class="filename">-d </em>). There are a number of
other options described in the documentation, such as the type of
service and TTL fields.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2371" /></a>The real strength of
<em class="filename">mgen</em> comes when you use it with a script. Here
is a very simple example of a script called <em class="filename">demo</em>
:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">START NOW
00001 1 ON 205.153.63.30:5000 PERIODIC 5 64
05000 1 MOD 205.153.63.30:5000 POISSON 20 64
15000 1 OFF</pre></blockquote>

The first line tells <em class="filename">mgen</em> to start generating
traffic as soon as the program is started. (An absolute start time
can also be specified.) The second line creates a flow with an ID of
<tt class="literal">1</tt> that starts 1 millisecond into a run that has
port 5000 on <em class="filename">205.153.63.30</em> as its destination.
The traffic is 5 packets per second, and each packet is 64 bytes in
length. The third line tells <em class="filename">mgen</em> to modify the
flow with ID <tt class="literal">1</tt>. 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds)
into the flow, packet generation should switch to a Poission
distribution with a rate of 20 packets per second. The last line
terminates the flow at 15,000 milliseconds. While this script has
only one flow, a script can contain many.
</p><p>

Here is an example of the invocation of <em class="filename">mgen</em>
with a script:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# mgen -i ep0 demo

MGEN: Version 3.1a3
MGEN: Loading event queue ...
MGEN: Seeding random number generator ...
MGEN: Beginning packet generation ...
MGEN: Packets Tx'd       :      226
MGEN: Transmission period:    15.047 seconds.
MGEN: Ave Tx pkt rate    :    15.019 pps.
MGEN: Interface Stats    :      ep0
             Frames Tx'd :      234
               Tx Errors :        0
              Collisions :        0
MGEN: Done.</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2372" /></a>Since a
Poisson distribution was used for part of the flow, we can't
expect to see exactly 225 packets in exactly 15 seconds.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2373" /></a><a name="INDEX-2374" /></a><a name="INDEX-2375" /></a><a name="INDEX-2376" /></a>For many purposes,
<em class="filename">mgen</em> is the only tool from the MGEN tool set
that you will need. But for some purposes, you will need more.
<em class="filename">drec</em> is a receiver program that can log received
data. <em class="filename">mgen</em> and <em class="filename">drec</em> can be
used with RSVP (with ISI's <em class="filename">rsvpd</em>). You
will recall that with RSVP, the client must establish the session.
<em class="filename">drec</em> has this capability. Like
<em class="filename">mgen</em>, <em class="filename">drec</em> has an optional
graphical interface. In addition to <em class="filename">mgen</em> and
<em class="filename">drec</em>, the MGEN tool set includes a number of
additional utilities that can be used to analyze the data collected
by <em class="filename">drec</em>.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2377" /></a><a name="INDEX-2378" /></a>One last note on load
generators -- software load generators assume that the systems
they run on are fast enough to generate enough traffic to adequately
load the system being tested. In some circumstances, this will not be
true. For some applications, dedicated hardware load generators must
be used.<a name="INDEX-2379" /></a><a name="INDEX-2380" /></a><a name="INDEX-2381" /></a><a name="INDEX-2382" /></a><a name="INDEX-2383" /></a><a name="INDEX-2384" /></a><a name="INDEX-2385" /></a><a name="INDEX-2386" /></a><a name="INDEX-2387" /></a><a name="INDEX-2388" /></a><a name="INDEX-2389" /></a><a name="INDEX-2390" /></a>
