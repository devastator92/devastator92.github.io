<a name="INDEX-895" /></a><a name="INDEX-896" /></a><a name="INDEX-897" /></a><a name="INDEX-898" /></a>Packet capture
and analysis is the most powerful technique that will be discussed in
this book -- it is the ultimate troubleshooting tool. If you
really want to know what is happening on your network, you will need
to capture traffic. No other tool provides more information.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-899" /></a><a name="INDEX-900" /></a><a name="INDEX-901" /></a>On the other hand, no other tool requires
the same degree of sophistication to use. If misused, it can
compromise your system's security and invade the privacy of
your users. Of the software described in this book, packet capture
software is the most difficult to use to its full potential and
requires a thorough understanding of the underlying protocols to be
used effectively. As noted in <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "Network Management and Troubleshooting"</a>, you must
ensure that what you do conforms to your organization's
policies and any applicable laws. You should also be aware of the
ethical implications of your actions.
</p><p>

This chapter begins with a discussion of the type of tools available
and various issues involved in traffic capture. Next I describe
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>, a ubiquitous and powerful packet
capture tool. This is followed by a brief description of other
closely related tools. Next is a discussion of
<em class="filename">ethereal</em>, a powerful protocol analyzer that is
rapidly gaining popularity. Next I describe some of the problems
created by traffic capture. The chapter concludes with a discussion
of packet capture tools available for use with Microsoft Windows
platforms.

<h2 class="sect1">5.1. Traffic Capture Tools</h2>

<a name="INDEX-902" /></a><a name="INDEX-903" /></a><a name="INDEX-904" /></a><a name="INDEX-905" /></a><a name="INDEX-906" /></a><a name="INDEX-907" /></a><a name="INDEX-908" /></a><a name="INDEX-909" /></a><em class="emphasis">Packet capture</em> is
the real-time collection of data as it travels over networks. Tools
for the capture and analysis of traffic go by a number of names
including <em class="emphasis">packet sniffers,</em> <em class="emphasis">packet
analyzers,</em> <em class="emphasis">protocol analyzers,</em> and
even <em class="emphasis">traffic monitors</em>. Although there is some
inconsistency in how these terms are used, the primary difference is
in how much analysis or interpretation is provided after a packet is
captured. Packet sniffers generally do the least amount of analysis,
while protocol analyzers provide the greatest level of
interpretation. Packet analyzers typically lie somewhere in between.
All have the capture of raw data as a core function. Traffic monitors
typically are more concerned with collecting statistical information,
but many support the capture of raw data. Any of these may be
augmented with additional functions such as graphing utilities and
traffic generators. This chapter describes
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>, a packet sniffer, several analysis
tools, and <em class="filename">ethereal</em>, a protocol analyzer.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-910" /></a><a name="INDEX-911" /></a>While packet capture might seem
like a low-level tool, it can also be used to examine what is
happening at higher levels, including the application level, because
of the way data is encapsulated. Since application data is
encapsulated in a generally transparent way by the lower levels of
the protocol stack, the data is basically intact when examined at a
lower level.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-22">[22]</a> By examining network traffic, we can
examine the data generated at the higher levels. (In general,
however, it is usually much easier to debug an application using a
tool designed for that application. Tools specific to several
application-level protocols are described in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Application-Level Tools"</a>.) 
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-22" /></a>[22]There are two obvious exceptions. The
data may be encrypted, or the data may be fragmented among multiple
packets.</p><p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-912" /></a>Packet capture programs also require the
most technical expertise of any program we will examine. A thorough
understanding of the underlying protocol is often required to
interpret the results. For this reason alone, packet capture is a
tool that you want to become familiar with well before you need it.
When you are having problems, it will also be helpful to have
comparison systems so you can observe normal behavior. The time to
learn how your system works is before you have problems. This
technique cannot be stressed enough -- do a baseline run for your
network periodically and analyze it closely so you know what traffic
you expect to see on your network before you have problems.
