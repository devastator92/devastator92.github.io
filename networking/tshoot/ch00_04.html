<h2 class="sect1">0.4. Acknowledgments</h2>

This book would not have been possible without the help of many
people. First on the list are the toolsmiths who created the tools
described here. The number and quality of the tools that are
available is truly remarkable. We all owe a considerable debt to the
people who selflessly develop these tools.
</p>

I have been very fortunate that many of my normal duties have
overlapped significantly with tasks related to writing this book.
These duties have included setting up and operating Lander
University's networking laboratory and evaluating tools for use
in teaching. For their help with the laboratory, I gratefully
acknowledge Lander's Department of Computing Services,
particularly Anthony Aven, Mike Henderson, and Bill Screws. This
laboratory was funded in part by a National Science Foundation grant,
DUE-9980366. I gratefully acknowledge the support the National
Science Foundation has given to Lander. I have also benefited from
conversations with the students and faculty at Lander, particularly
Jim Crabtree. I would never have gotten started on this project
without the help and encouragement of Jerry Wilson. Jerry, I owe you
lunch (and a lot more).
</p>

This book has benefited from the help of numerous people within the
O'Reilly organization. In particular, the support given by
Robert Denn, Mike Loukides, and Rob Romano, to name only a few, has
been exceptional. After talking with authors working with other
publishers, I consider myself very fortunate in working with
technically astute people from the start. If you are thinking about
writing a technical book, O'Reilly is a publisher to consider.
</p>

The reviewers for this book have done an outstanding job. Thanks go
to John Archie, Anthony Aven, Jon Forrest, and Kevin and Diana
Mullet. They cannot be faulted for not turning a sow's ear into
a silk purse.
</p>

It seems every author always acknowledges his or her family. It has
almost become a clich&eacute;, but that doesn't make it any
less true. This book would not have been possible without the support
and patience of my family, who have endured more that I should have
ever asked them to endure. Thank you.
