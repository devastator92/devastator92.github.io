<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

This book is not a general introduction to network troubleshooting.
Rather, it is about one aspect of troubleshooting -- information
collection. This book is a tutorial introduction to tools and
techniques for collecting information about computer networks. It
should be particularly useful when dealing with network problems, but
the tools and techniques it describes are not limited to
troubleshooting. Many can and should be used on a regular basis
regardless of whether you are having problems.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1" /><a name="INDEX-2" />Some of the tools I have selected
may be a bit surprising to many. I strongly believe that the best
approach to troubleshooting is to be proactive, and the tools I
discuss reflect this belief. Basically, if you don't understand
how your network works before you have problems, you will find it
very difficult to diagnose problems when they occur. Many of the
tools described here should be used before you have problems. As
such, these tools could just as easily be classified as network
management or network performance analysis tools.
</p>

This book does not attempt to catalog every possible tool. There are
simply too many tools already available, and the number is growing
too rapidly. Rather, this book focuses on the tools that I believe
are the most useful, a collection that should help in dealing with
almost any problem you see. I have tried to include pointers to other
relevant tools when there wasn't space to discuss them. In many
cases, I have described more than one tool for a particular job. It
is extremely rare for two tools to have exactly the same features.
One tool may be more useful than another, depending on circumstances.
And, because of the differences in operating systems, a specific tool
may not be available on every system. It is worth knowing the
alternatives.
</p>

The book is about freely available Unix tools. Many are open source
tools covered by GNU- or BSD-style licenses. In selecting tools, my
first concern has been availability. I have given the highest
priority to the standard Unix utilities. Next in priority are tools
available as packages or ports for FreeBSD or Linux. Tools requiring
separate compilation or available only as binaries were given a lower
priority since these may be available on fewer systems. In some
cases, PC-only tools and commercial tools are noted but are not
discussed in detail. The bulk of the book is specific to Ethernet and
TCP/IP, but the general approach and many of the tools can be used
with other technologies.
</p>

While this is a book about Unix tools, at the end of most of the
chapters I have included a brief section for Microsoft Windows users.
These sections are included since even small networks usually include
a few computers running Windows. These sections are not, even in the
wildest of fantasies, meant to be definitive. They are provided
simply as starting points -- a quick overview of what is
available.
</p>

Finally, this book describes a wide range of tools. Many of these
tools are designed to do one thing and are often overlooked because
of their simplicity. Others are extremely complex tools or sets of
tools. I have not attempted to provide a comprehensive treatment for
each tool discussed. Some of these tools can be extremely complex
when used to their fullest. Some have manuals and other documentation
that easily exceed the size of this book. Most have additional
documentation that you will want to retrieve once you begin using
them.
</p>

My goal is to make you aware of the tools and to provide you with
enough information that you can decide which ones may be the most
useful to you and in what context so that you can get started using
the tools. Each chapter centers on a collection of related tasks or
problems and tools useful for dealing with these tasks. The
discussion is limited to features that are relevant to the problem
being discussed. Consequently, the same tool may be discussed in
several places throughout the book.
</p>

Please be warned: the suitability or behavior of these tools on your
system cannot be guaranteed. While the material in this book is
presented in good faith, neither the author nor O'Reilly &amp;
Associates makes any explicit or implied warranty as to the behavior
or suitability of these tools. We strongly urge you to assess and
evaluate these tool as appropriate for your circumstances.

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Audience</h2>

This book is written primarily for individuals new to network
administration. It should also be useful to those of you who have
inherited responsibility for existing systems and networks set up by
others. This book is designed to help you acquire the additional
information you need to do your job.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-3" />Unfortunately, the
book may also appeal to crackers. I truly regret this and wish there
were a way to present this material to limit its worth to crackers. I
never met a system manager or network administrator who wasn't
overworked. Time devoted to security is time stolen from providing
new services to users or improving existing services. There simply is
no valid justification for cracking. I can only hope that the
positive uses for the information I provide will outweigh the
inevitable malicious uses to which it may be put. I would feel much
better if crackers would forego buying this book.
</p>

In writing this book, I attempted to write the sort of book I often
wished I had when I was learning. Certainly, there are others who are
more knowledgeable and better prepared to write this book. But they
never seemed to get around to it. They have written pieces of this
book, a chapter here or a tutorial there, for which I am both
immensely thankful and greatly indebted.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-4" />I see this book as a work in progress. I
hope that the response to it will make future expanded editions
possible. You can help by sending me your comments and corrections. I
would particularly like to hear about new tools and about how you
have used the tools described here to solve your problems. Perhaps
some of the experts who should have written this book will share
their wisdom! While I can't promise to respond to your email, I
will read it. You can contact me through O'Reilly Book Support
