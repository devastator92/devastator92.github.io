<h2 class="sect1">12.2. Task-Specific Troubleshooting</h2>

<a name="INDEX-2877" /><a name="INDEX-2878" /><a name="INDEX-2879" />The guidelines just given are a
general or generic overview of troubleshooting. Of course, each
problem will be different, and you will need to vary your approach as
appropriate. The remainder of this chapter consists of guidelines for
a number of the more common troubleshooting tasks you might face. It
is hoped that these will give you further insight into the process.
</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">12.2.1. Installation Testing</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2880" /><a name="INDEX-2881" /><a name="INDEX-2882" /><a name="INDEX-2883" /><a name="INDEX-2884" /><a name="INDEX-2885" />Ironically, one of
the best ways to save time and avoid troubleshooting is to take the
time to do a thorough job of testing when you install software or
hardware. You will be testing the system when you are most familiar
with the installation process, and you will avoid disruptions to
service that can happen when a problem isn't discovered until
the software or hardware is in use.
</p><p>

This is a somewhat broad interpretation of troubleshooting, but in my
experience, there is very little difference between the testing you
will do when you install software and the testing you will do when
you encounter a problem. Overwhelmingly the only difference for most
people is the scope of the testing done. Most people will test until
they believe that a system is working correctly and then stop.
Failures, particularly multiple failures, may leave you skeptical,
while some people tend to be overly optimistic when installing new
software.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-12-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.2.1.1. Firewall testing</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2886" /><a name="INDEX-2887" /><a name="INDEX-2888" /><a name="INDEX-2889" />Because
of the complexities, firewall testing is an excellent example of the
problems that installation testing may present. Troubleshooting a
firewall is a demanding task for several reasons. First, to avoid
disruptions in service, initial firewall testing should be done in an
isolated environment before moving on to a production environment.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2890" />Second, you need to be very careful
to develop an appropriate set of tests so that you don't leave
gaping holes in your security. You'll need to go through a
firewall rule by rule. You won't be able to check every
possibility, but you should be able to test each general type of
traffic. For example, consider a rule that passes HTTP traffic to
your web server. You will want to pass traffic to port 80 on that
server. If you are taking the approach of denying all traffic that is
not explicitly permitted, potentially, you will want to block traffic
to that host at all other ports. You will also want to block traffic
to port 80 on other hosts.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-42">[42]</a> Thus,
you should develop a set of three tests for this one action. Although
there will be some duplicated tests, you'll want to take the
same approach for each rule. Developing an explicit set of tests is
the key step in this type of testing.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-42" />[42]If you doubt the need for
this last test, read RFC 3093, a slightly tongue-in-cheek description
of how to use port 80 to bypass a firewall.</p><p> </blockquote>

The first step in testing a firewall is to test the environment in
which the firewall will function without the firewall. It can be
extraordinarily frustrating to try to debug anomalous firewall
behavior only to discover that you had a routing problem before you
began. Thus, the first thing you will want to do is turn off any
filtering and test your routing. You could use tools like
<em class="filename">ripquery</em> to retrieve routing tables and examine
entries, but it is probably much simpler to use
<em class="filename">ping</em> to check connectivity, assuming ICMP
ECHO_REQUEST packets aren't being blocked. (If this is the
case, you might try tools like <em class="filename">nmap</em> or
<em class="filename">hping</em>.)
</p><p>

You'll also want to verify that all concomitant software is
working. This will include all intrusion detection software,
accounting and logging software, and testing software. For example,
you'll probably use packet capture software like
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em> or <em class="filename">ethereal</em> to
verify the operation of your firewall and will want to make sure the
firewall is working properly. I hate to admit it, but I've
started packet capture software on a host that I forgot was attached
to a switch and banged my head wondering why I wasn't seeing
anything. Clearly, if I had used this setup to make sure packets were
blocked without first testing it, I could have been severely misled.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2891" /><a name="INDEX-2892" /><a name="INDEX-2893" />Test the firewall in isolation. If
you are adding filtering to a production router, admittedly this is
going to be a problem. The easiest way to test in isolation is to
connect each interface to an isolated host that can both generate and
capture packets. You might use <em class="filename">hping</em>,
<em class="filename">nemesis</em>, or any of the other custom packet
generation software discussed in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Testing Connectivity Protocols"</a>. Work
through each of your tests for each rule with the rule disabled and
enabled. Be sure you explicitly document all your tests, particularly
the syntax.
</p><p>

Once you are convinced that the firewall is working, it is time to
move it online. If you can schedule offline testing, that is the best
approach. Work through your tests again with and without the filters
enabled. If offline testing isn't possible, you can still go
through your tests with the filters enabled.
</p><p>

Finally, don't forget to come back and go through these tests
periodically. In particular, you'll want to reevaluate the
firewall every time you change rules.

<h3 class="sect2">12.2.2. Performance Analysis and Monitoring</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2894" /><a name="INDEX-2895" />If a
system simply isn't working, then you know troubleshooting is
needed. But in many cases, it may not be clear that you even have a
problem. Performance analysis is often the first step to getting a
handle on whether your system is functioning properly. And it is
often the case that careful performance analysis will identify the
problem so that no further troubleshooting is needed.
</p><p>

Performance analysis is another management task that hinges on
collecting information. It is a task that you will never complete,
and it is important at every stage in the system's life cycle.
The most successful network administrator will take a proactive
approach, addressing issues before they become problems. <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Device Monitoring with SNMP"</a> and <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Performance Measurement Tools"</a> discussed the
use of specific tools in greater detail.
</p><p>

For planning, performance analysis is used to compare systems,
establish system requirements, and do capacity planning and
forecasting. For management, it provides guidance in configuring and
tuning the system. In particular, the identification of bottlenecks
can be essential for management, planning, and troubleshooting.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2896" /><a name="INDEX-2897" /><a name="INDEX-2898" /><a name="INDEX-2899" /><a name="INDEX-2900" /><a name="INDEX-2901" /><a name="INDEX-2902" />There are three general approaches to
performance analysis -- <em class="emphasis">analytical modeling</em>,
<em class="emphasis">simulations</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">measurement</em>. Analytical models are mathematical
models usually based on queuing theory. Simulations are computer
models that attempt to mimic the behavior of the system through
computer programs. Measurement is, of course, the collection of data
from an existing network. This book has focused primarily on
measurement (although simulation tools were mentioned in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Testing Connectivity Protocols"</a>). 
</p><p>

Each approach has its role. In practice, there can be a considerable
overlap in using these approaches. Analytical models can serve as the
basis for simulations, or direct measurements may be needed to supply
parameters used with analytical models or simulations.
</p><p>

easurement has its limitations. Obviously, the system must exist
before measurements can be made so it may not be a viable tool for
planning. Measurements tend to produce the most variable results. And
many things can go wrong with measurements. On the positive side,
measurement carries a great deal of authority with most people. When
you say you have measured something, this is treated as irrefutable
evidence by many, often unjustifiably.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-12-SECT-2.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.2.2.1. General steps</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2903" />Measuring performance is something of an
art. It is much more difficult to decide what to measure and how to
make the actual measurements than it might appear at first glance.
And there are many ways to waste time collecting data that will not
be useful for your purposes.
</p><p>

What follows is a fairly informal description of the steps involved
in performance analysis. As I said before, listing the steps can be
very helpful in focusing attention on some parts of the process that
might otherwise be ignored.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-43">[43]</a> Of course, every situation is different, so
these steps are only an approximation. Designing performance analysis
tests is an iterative process. You should go back through these steps
as you proceed, refining each step as needed.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-43" />[43]If you would like a more
complete discussion of the steps in performance analysis, you should
get Raj Jain's exceptional book, <em class="emphasis">The Art of Computer
Systems Performance Analysis</em>. Jain's book considers
performance analysis from a broader perspective than this
book.</p><p> </blockquote>

<ol><li>
<a name="INDEX-2904" />State your goal. This is the
question you want to answer. At this point, it may be fairly vague,
but you will refine it as you progress. You need a sense of direction
to get started. A common mistake is to allow a poorly defined goal to
remain vague throughout the process, so be sure to revisit this step
often. Also, try to avoid goals that bias your approach. For
instance, set out to compare systems rather than show that one system
is better than another.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2905" /><a name="INDEX-2906" />As an example, a network
administrator might ask if the network backbone is adequate to
support current levels of traffic. While an extremely important
question, it is quite vague at this point. But stating the goal
allows you to start focusing on the problem. For example, formally
stating this problem may lead you to ask what
<em class="emphasis">adequate</em> really means. Or you might go on to
consider what the relevant time frame is, i.e., what
<em class="emphasis">current</em> means.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2907" />Define your system. The definition
of your system will vary with your goal. You will need to decide what
parts of the system to include and in what detail. You may want to
exclude those parts outside your control. If you are interested in
server performance, you will undoubtedly want to consider the various
subsystems of the server separately -- such as disks, memory, CPU,
and network interfaces.
</p><p>

With the backbone example, what exactly is the backbone? Certainly it
will include equipment such as routers and switches, but does it
include servers? If you do include servers, you will want to view the
server as a single entity, a source or sink for network traffic
perhaps, but not component by component.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2908" />Identify possible outcomes. This
step consists of identifying possible answers to the question you
want to answer. This is a refinement of Step 1 but should be
addressed after the parts of the system are identified. Identifying
outcomes establishes the level of your interest, how much detail you
might need, and how much work you are going to have to do. You are
determining the granularity of your measurements with this step.
</p><p>

For example, possible outcomes for the question of backbone
performance might be that performance is adequate, that the system
suffers minor congestion during the periods of heaviest load, or that
the system is usually suffering serious congestion with heavy packet
loss. For many purposes, just selecting one of these three answers
might be adequate. However, in some cases, you may want a much more
descriptive answer. For example, you may want some estimation of the
average utilization, maximum utilization, percent of time at maximum
utilization, or number of lost packets. Ultimately, the degree of
detail required by the answer will determine the scope of the
project. You need to make this decision early, or you may have to
repeat the project to gather additional information.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2909" />Identify and select what you will
measure. Metrics are those system characteristics that can be
quantitatively measured. The choice of a metric will depend on the
services you are examining. Be careful in your selection. It is often
tempting to go with metrics based on how easy the data is to collect
rather than on how relevant the data is to the goal. For a network
backbone, this might include throughput, delay, utilization, number
of packets sent, number of packets discarded, or average packet size.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2910" /><a name="INDEX-2911" /><a name="INDEX-2912" />If appropriate,
identify test parameters and factors.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-44">[44]</a> Parameters and factors are
characteristics of the system that affect performance that can be
changed. You'll change these to see what effect they have on
the system. Parameters include both system and load (or traffic)
parameters. Try to be as systematic as possible in identifying and
evaluating parameters to avoid arbitrary decisions. It is very easy
to overlook relevant parameters or include irrelevant ones.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-44" />[44]Further
distinctions between parameters and factors are sometimes made but
don't seem relevant when considered solely from the perspective
of measurements.</p><p> </blockquote>

For a network backbone, system parameters may include interface
speeds and link speeds or the use of load sharing. For traffic, you
might use a tool like <em class="filename">mgen</em> to add an additional
load. But for simple performance measurement, you may elect to change
nothing.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2913" />Select tools. Once you have a clear
picture of what you want to do, it is time to select the tools of
interest. It is all too easy to do this too soon. Don't let the
tools you have determine what you are going to do. Tools for backbone
performance might include using <em class="filename">ntop</em> on a link
or SNMP-based tools.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2914" />Establish measurement constraints.
On a production network, establishing constraints usually means
deciding when and where to make your measurements. You will also need
to decide on the frequency and duration of your measurements. This is
often more a matter of intuition than engineering. This is something
that you will have to do iteratively, adjusting your approach based
on the results you get. Unless you have a very compelling reason,
measurements should be taken under representative conditions.
</p><p>

For backbone performance, for example, router interfaces are the
obvious places to look. Server interfaces are another reasonable
choice. You may also need to look at individual links as well,
particularly in a switched network. You will also need to sample at
different times, including in particular those times when the load is
heaviest. (Use <em class="filename">mrtg</em> or
<em class="filename">cricket</em> to determine this.) You will need to
ensure that your measurements have the appropriate level of detail.
If you have isochronous applications, such as video conferencing,
that are extremely sensitive to delay, five-minute averages will not
provide adequate information.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2915" /><a name="INDEX-2916" /><a name="INDEX-2917" />Review your
experimental design. Once you have decided what you want to measure
and how, you should look back over the process before you begin. Are
there any optimizations you can make to minimize the amount of work
you will have to do? Will the measurements you make really answer
your questions? It is wise to review these questions before you
invest large amounts of time.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2918" />Collect data. The single most
important consideration in collecting data is that you adequately
document what you are doing. It is an all too common experience to
discover that you have a wonderful collection of data, but you
don't fully know or remember the circumstances surrounding its
collection. Consequently, you don't know how to interpret it.
If this happens, the only thing you can do is discard the data and
start over. Remember, collecting data is an iterative process. You
must examine your results and make adjustments as needed. It is too
easy to continue collecting worthless data when even a cursory
examination of your data would have revealed you were on the wrong
track.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2919" />Analyze data. Once the data is
collected, you must analyze, interpret, and act upon your results.
This analysis will, of course, depend heavily on the context and
goals of the investigation. But an essential element is to condense
the data and extract the needed information, presenting it in a
concise form. It is often the case that measurements will create
massive amounts of data that are meaningless until carefully
analyzed.
</p><p>

Don't get too carried away. Often the simplest analyses are of
greater value than overly complex analyses. Simple analyses can often
be more easily understood. But whatever you conclude, you'll
need to do it all again. System performance analysis is a
never-ending task.<a name="INDEX-2920" />

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-12-SECT-2.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.2.2.2. Bottleneck analysis</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2921" /><a name="INDEX-2922" /><a name="INDEX-2923" />Since networks are composed of a
number of pieces, if the pieces are not well matched, poor
performance may depend on the behavior of a single component.
Bottleneck analysis is the process of identifying this component.
</p><p>

When looking at performance, you'll need to be sure you get a
complete picture. Generally, one bottleneck will dominate performance
statistics. Many systems, however, will have multiple bottlenecks.
It's just that one bottleneck is a little worse than the
others. Correcting one bottleneck will simply shift the
problem -- the bottleneck will move from one component to another.
When doing performance monitoring, your goal should be to discover as
many bottlenecks as possible.
</p><p>

Often identifying a bottleneck is easy. Once you have a clear picture
of your network's architecture, topology, and uses, bottlenecks
will be obvious. For example, if 90% of your network traffic is to
the Internet and you have a gigabit backbone and a 56-Kbps WAN
connection, you won't need a careful analysis to identify your
bottleneck.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2924" />Identifying bottlenecks is process
dependent. What may be a bottleneck for one process may not be a
problem for another. For example, if you are moving small files, the
delay in making a connection will be the primary bottleneck. If you
are moving large files, the speed of the link may be more important.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2925" />Bottleneck analysis is essential in
planning because it will tell you what improvements will provide the
greatest benefit to your network. The only real way to escape
bottlenecks is to grossly overengineer your network, not something
you'll normally want to do. Thus, your goal should not be to
completely eliminate bottlenecks but to minimize their impact to the
point that they don't cause any real problems. Upgrading the
network in a way that doesn't address bottlenecks will provide
very little benefit to the network. If the bottlenecks on your
network are a slow WAN connection and slow servers, upgrading from
Fast Ethernet to Gigabit Ethernet will be a foolish waste of money.
The key consideration here is utilization. If you are seeing 25%
utilization with Fast Ethernet, don't be surprised to see
utilization drop below 3% with Gigabit Ethernet. But you should be
aware that even if the utilization is low, increasing the capacity of
a line will shorten download times for large files. Whether this is
worthwhile will depend on your organization's mission and
priorities.
</p><p>

Here is a rough outline of the steps you might go through to identify
a bottleneck:
</p><p>

<ol><li>
<a name="INDEX-2926" />Map your network. The first step is to
develop a clear picture of your network's topology. To do this,
you can use the tools described in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Device Discovery and Mapping"</a>.
<em class="filename">tkined</em> might be a good choice. Often potential
bottlenecks are obvious once you have a clear picture of your
network. At the very least, you may be able to distinguish the parts
of the network that are likely to have bottlenecks from parts that
don't need to be examined, reducing the work you will have to
do.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2927" />Identify time-dependent behavior. The
problems bottlenecks cause, unless they are really severe, tend to
come and go. The next logical step is to locate the most heavily used
devices and the times when they are in greatest use. You'll
want to use a tool like <em class="filename">mrtg</em> or
<em class="filename">cricket</em> to identify time-dependent behavior.
(Understanding time-dependent behavior can also be helpful in
identifying when you can work on the problem with the least impact on
users.)
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2928" /><a name="INDEX-2929" /><a name="INDEX-2930" />Pinpoint the problems. At this
point, you should have narrowed your focus to a few key parts of the
network and a few key times. Now you will want to drill down on
specific devices and links. <em class="filename">ntop</em> is a likely
choice at this point, but any SNMP-based tool may be useful.
</p><p>
</li><li>
Select the tool. How you will proceed from here will depend on what
you have discovered. It is likely that you will be able to classify
the problem as stemming from an edge device, such as a server or a
path between devices. Doing so will simplify the decision of what to
do next.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2931" /><a name="INDEX-2932" />If you believe the problem lies with
a path, you can use the tools described in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Path Characteristics"</a> to drill down to a specific device or single
link. You'll probably want to get an idea of the nature of the
traffic over the link. <em class="filename">ntop</em> is one choice, or
you could use a tool like <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>,
<em class="filename">ethereal</em>, or one of the tools that analyzes
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em> traffic.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2933" />For a link device like a
router or switch, you'll need to look at basic performance.
SNMP-based tools are the best choice here.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2934" />For end
devices, you need to look at the performance of the device at each
level of the communications architecture. You could use
<em class="filename">spray</em> to examine the interface performance. For
the stack, you might compare the time between SYN and ACK packets
with the time between application packets. (Use
<em class="filename">ethereal</em> or <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> to
collect this information.) The setup times should be independent of
the application, depending only on the stack. If the stack responds
quickly and the application doesn't, you'll need to focus
on the application.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2935" /><a name="INDEX-2936" />Fix the problem. Once you have an
idea of the source of the problem, you can then decide how to deal
with it. For poor link performance, you have several choices. You can
upgrade the link bandwidth or alter the network topology to change
the load on the link. Adding interfaces to a server is one very
simple solution. Attaching a server to multiple subnets is a quick
way to decrease traffic between those subnets. Policy-based routing
is yet another approach. You can use routing priorities to ensure
that important traffic is handled preferentially.
</p><p>

For an edge device such as an attached server, you'll want to
distinguish among hardware problems, operating system problems, and
application problems, then upgrade accordingly.
</p><p>
</li></ol>
Bottleneck analysis is something you should do on an ongoing basis.
The urgency will depend on user perceptions. If users are
complaining, it doesn't matter what the numbers say, you have a
problem. If users aren't complaining, your analysis is less
pressing but should still be done.<a name="INDEX-2937" /><a name="INDEX-2938" /><a name="INDEX-2939" /> 
</p><p>

</div>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-12-SECT-2.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.2.2.3. Capacity planning</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2940" /><a name="INDEX-2941" /><a name="INDEX-2942" />Capacity planning is an
extremely important task. Done correctly, it is also an extremely
complex and difficult task, both to learn and to do. But this
shouldn't keep you from attempting it. The description here can
best be described as a crude, first-order approximation of capacity
planning. But it will give you a place to start while you are
learning.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2943" /><a name="INDEX-2944" /><a name="INDEX-2945" />Capacity planning is really an
umbrella that describes several closely related activities.
<em class="emphasis">Capacity management</em> is the process of allocating
resources in a cost-efficient way. It is concerned with the resources
that you currently have. (As you might guess, this is closely related
to bottleneck analysis.) <em class="emphasis">Trend analysis</em> is the
process of looking at system performance over time, trying to
identify how it has changed in the past with the goal of predicting
future changes. <em class="emphasis">Capacity planning</em> attempts to
combine capacity management and trend analysis. The goal is to
predict future needs to provide for effective planning.
</p><p>

The basic steps are fairly straightforward to describe, just
difficult to carry out. First, decide what you need to measure. That
means looking at your system in much the same way you did with
bottleneck analysis but augmenting your analysis with anything you
know about the future growth of your system. You'll need to
think about your system in context to do this.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2946" /><a name="INDEX-2947" />Next, select appropriate tools to collect
the information you'll need. (<em class="filename">mrtg</em> and
<em class="filename">cricket</em> are the most obvious tools among those
described in this book, but there are a number of other viable tools
if you are willing to do the work to archive the data.) With the
tools in place, begin monitoring your system, recording and archiving
appropriate data. Deciding what to keep and how to organize it is a
tremendously difficult problem. Every situation is different. Each
situation is largely a question of balancing the amount of work
involved in keeping the data in an organized and accessible manner
with the likelihood that you will actually use it. This can come only
from experience.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2948" />Once you have the
measurements, you will need to analyze them. In general, focus on
areas that show the greatest change. Collecting and analyzing data
will be an iterative process. If little is different from one
measurement to the next, then collect data less frequently. When
there is high variability, collect more often.
</p><p>

Finally, you'll make your predictions and adjust your system
accordingly.

<a name="INDEX-2949" />There are a number of difficulties in
capacity planning. Perhaps the greatest difficulty comes with
unanticipated, fundamental changes in the way your network is used.
If you will be offering new services, predictions based on trends
that predate these services will not adequately predict new needs.
For example, if you are introducing new technologies such as Internet
telephony or video, trend analysis before the fact will be of limited
value. There is a saying that you can't predict how many people
will use a bridge by counting how many people are currently swimming
across the river. If this is the case, about the best you can do is
look to others who have built similar bridges over similar rivers.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2950" /><a name="INDEX-2951" /><a name="INDEX-2952" />Another closely related problem is
differential growth. If your network, like most, provides a variety
of different services, then they are probably growing at different
rates. This makes it very difficult to predict aggregate performance
or need if you haven't adequately collected data to analyze
individual trends.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2953" /><a name="INDEX-2954" />Yet another difficulty is
motivation. The key to trend analysis is keeping adequate records,
i.e., measuring and recording information in a way that makes it
accessible and usable. This is difficult for many people since the
records won't have much immediate utility. Their worth comes
from being able to look back at them over time for trends. It is
difficult to invest the time needed to collect and maintain this data
when there will be no immediate return on the effort and when
fundamental changes can destroy the utility of the data.
</p><p>

You should be aware of these difficulties, but you should not let
them discourage you. The cost of not doing capacity planning is much
greater.<a name="INDEX-2955" /><a name="INDEX-2956" /><a name="INDEX-2957" /><a name="INDEX-2958" /><a name="INDEX-2959" /><a name="INDEX-2960" />
