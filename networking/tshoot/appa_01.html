This appendix begins with a brief discussion of retrieving and
installing software tools. It then provides a list of potential
sources for the software. First I describe several excellent general
sources for tools, then I list specific sources.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2961" /></a><a name="INDEX-2962" /></a>Much of this software
requires root privileges and could contain dangerous code. Be sure
you get your code from reliable sources. Considerable effort has been
made to provide canonical sources, but no guarantee can be made for
the trustworthiness of the code or the sources listed here. Most of
these programs are available as FreeBSD ports or Linux packages. I
have used them, when available, for testing for this book.

<h2 class="sect1">A.1. Installing Software</h2>

<a name="INDEX-2963" /></a><a name="INDEX-2964" /></a>I
have not tried to describe how to install individual tools in this
book. First, in my experience, a set of directions that is accurate
for one version of the software may not be accurate for the next
version. Even more likely, directions for one operating system may
fail miserably for another. This is frequently true even for
different versions of the same operating system. Consequently, trying
to develop a reasonable set of directions for each tool for a variety
of operating systems was considered unfeasible. In general, the best
source of information, i.e., the only information that is likely to
be reliable, is the information that comes with the software itself.
Read the directions!
</p><p>

Having said this, I have tried to give some generic directions for
installing software. At best, these are meant to augment the existing
directions. They may help clarify matters when the included
directions are a little too brief. These instructions are not meant
as replacements.
</p><p>

Installing software has gotten much easier in the last few years,
thanks in part to several developments. First, GNU configure and
build tools have had a tremendous impact in erasing the differences
created by different operating systems. Second, there have been
improvements in file transfer and compression tools as well as
increased standardization of the tools used. Finally, several
operating systems now include mechanisms to automate the process. If
you can use these, your life will be much simpler. I have briefly
described three here -- the Solaris package system, the Red Hat
package manager, and the FreeBSD port system. Please consult the
appropriate documentation for the details for each.
</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">A.1.1. Generic Installs</h3>

Here is a quick review of basic steps you will go through in
installing a program. Not every step will be needed in every case. If
you have specific directions for a product, use those directions, not
these! (Although slightly dated, a very comprehensive discussion can
be found in <em class="filename">Porting Unix Software</em> by Greg
Lehey.)
</p><p>

<ol><li>
Locate a reliable, trustworthy source for both the software and
directions. Usually, the best sources are listed on a web page
managed by the author or her organization.
</p><p>
</li><li>
If you can locate directions before you begin, read them first.
Typically, basic directions can be found at the software's home
page. Frequently, however, the most complete directions are included
with the software distribution, so you may need to retrieve and
unpack the software to get at these.
</p><p>
</li><li>
Download the tool using FTP. You may be able to do this with your web
browser. Be certain you use a binary transfer if you are doing this
manually.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2965" /></a><a name="INDEX-2966" /></a><a name="INDEX-2967" /></a><a name="INDEX-2968" /></a><a name="INDEX-2969" /></a><a name="INDEX-2970" /></a>Uncompress the software if needed. If the
filename ends with<em class="filename"> .tgz </em>or<em class="filename">
.gz</em>, use <em class="filename">gunzip</em>. These are the two
most common formats, but there are other possibilities. Lehey's
book contains a detailed list of possibilities and appropriate tools.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2971" /></a><a name="INDEX-2972" /></a>Use
<em class="filename">tar</em> to unpack the software if needed, i.e., if
the filename ends with <em class="filename">.tar</em>. Typically, I use
the <em class="filename">-xvf</em> options.
</p><p>
</li><li>
Read any additional documentation that was included with the
distribution.
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2973" /></a><a name="INDEX-2974" /></a><a name="INDEX-2975" /></a>If the file is a precompiled
binary, you need only move it to the correct location. In general, it
is safer to download the source code and compile it yourself. It is
much harder to hide Trojan horses in source code (but not
impossible).
</p><p>
</li><li>
<a name="INDEX-2976" /></a>If you have a very
simple utility, you may need to compile it directly. This means
calling the compiler with the appropriate options. But for all but
the simplest programs, a makefile should be provided. If you see a
file named <em class="filename">Makefile</em>, you will use the
<em class="filename">make</em> command to build the program. It may be
necessary to customize the <em class="filename">Makefile</em> before you
can proceed. If you are lucky, the distribution will include a
<em class="filename">configure</em> script, a file that, when executed,
will automatically make any needed changes to the
<em class="filename">Makefile</em>. Look for this script first. If you
don't find it, look back over your directions for any needed
changes. If you don't find anything, examine the makefile for
embedded directions. If all else fails, you can try running
<em class="filename">make</em> without making any changes.
</p><p>
</li><li>
Finally, you may also need to run <em class="filename">make</em> with one
or more arguments to finish the installation, e.g., <em class="filename">make
install</em> to move the files to the appropriate directories
or <em class="filename">make clean</em> to remove unused files such as
object modules after linking. Look at your directions, or look for
comments embedded in the makefile.
</p><p>
</li></ol>
Hopefully each of these steps will be explained in detail in the
documentation with the software.

<h3 class="sect2">A.1.2. Solaris Packages</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2977" /></a><a name="INDEX-2978" /></a><a name="INDEX-2979" /></a>In Solaris, packages are directories
of the files needed to build or run a program. This is the mechanism
Sun Microsystems uses to distribute software. If you are installing
from a CD-ROM, the files will typically be laid out just the way you
need them. You will only need to mount the CD-ROM so you can get to
them. If you are downloading packages, you will typically need to
unpack them first, usually with the <em class="filename">tar</em> command.
You may want to do this under the default directory
<em class="filename">/var/spool/pkg</em>, but you can override this
location with command options when installing the package.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2980" /></a><a name="INDEX-2981" /></a>Once
you have the appropriate package on your system, you can use one of
several closely related commands to manage it. To install a package,
use the<em class="filename"> pkgadd</em> command. Without any arguments,
<em class="filename">pkgadd</em> will list the packages on your system and
give you the opportunity to select the package of interest.
Alternately, you can name the package you want to install. You can
use the <em class="filename">-d</em> option to specify a different
directory.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2982" /></a><a name="INDEX-2983" /></a><a name="INDEX-2984" /></a><a name="INDEX-2985" /></a><a name="INDEX-2986" /></a><a name="INDEX-2987" /></a><a name="INDEX-2988" /></a><a name="INDEX-2989" /></a>Other commands include the
<em class="filename">pkgrm</em> command to remove a package, the
<em class="filename">pkginfo</em> command to display information on which
packages are already installed on your system, and
<em class="filename">pkgchk</em> to check the integrity of the package.
</p><p>

For other software in package format, you might begin by looking at
<a href="http://sunfreeware.com/">http://sunfreeware.com</a> or
searching the Web for Sun's university alliance software
repositories. Use the string "sunsite" in your search.
</p><p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-APP-A-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">A.1.3. Red Hat Package Manager</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2990" /></a><a name="INDEX-2991" /></a><a name="INDEX-2992" /></a><a name="INDEX-2993" /></a><a name="INDEX-2994" /></a><a name="INDEX-2995" /></a>Different versions of Linux
have taken the idea of packages and expanded on it. Several different
package formats are available, but the Red Hat format is probably the
most common. There are several programs for the installation of
software in the RPM format. Of these, the Red Hat Package Manager
(<em class="filename">rpm</em>) is what I generally use. Two other package
management tools that provide GUIs include <em class="filename">glint</em>
and <em class="filename">gnorpm</em>.
</p><p>

First, download the package in question. Then, to install a package,
call <em class="filename">rpm</em> with the options
<em class="filename">-ivh</em> and the name of the package. If all goes
well, that is all there is to it. You can use the
<em class="filename">-e</em> option to remove a package.
</p><p>

A variety of packages come with many Linux distributions. Numerous
sites on the Web offer extensive collections of Linux software in RPM
format. If you are using Red Hat Linux, try <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">http://www.redhat.com</a>. Many of the
repositories will provide you with a list of dependencies, which
you'll need to install first.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-APP-A-SECT-1.4" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">A.1.4. FreeBSD Ports</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2996" /></a><a name="INDEX-2997" /></a><a name="INDEX-2998" /></a><a name="INDEX-2999" /></a><a name="INDEX-3000" /></a><a name="INDEX-3001" /></a>Another approach to automating
software installation is the port collection approach used by
FreeBSD. This, by far, is the easiest approach to use and has been
adapted to other systems including OpenBSD and Debian Linux. The
FreeBSD port collection is basically a set of directions for
installing software. Literally thousands of programs are available.
</p><p>

Software is grouped by category in subdirectories in the
<em class="filename">/usr/ports</em> directory. You change to the
appropriate directory for the program of interest and type
<em class="emphasis">make install</em>. At that point, you sit back and
watch the magic. The port system will attempt to locate the
appropriate file in the <em class="filename">/usr/ports/distfiles</em>
directory. If the file is not there, it will then try downloading the
file from an appropriate site via FTP. Usually the port system knows
about several sites so, if it can't reach one, it will try
another. Once it has the file, it will calculate and verify a
checksum for the file. It next applies appropriate patches and checks
dependencies. It will automatically install other ports as needed.
Once everything is in place, it will compile the software. Finally,
it installs the software and documentation. When it works, which is
almost always, it is simply extraordinary. The port collection is an
installation option with FreeBSD. Alternately, you can visit
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">http://www.freebsd.org</a>. The
process is described in the <em class="emphasis">FreeBSD Handbook</em>.
</p><p>

When evaluating a new piece of software, I have the luxury of testing
the software on several different platforms. In general, I find the
FreeBSD port system the easiest approach to use. If I have trouble
with a FreeBSD port, I'll look for a Linux package next. If
that fails, I generally go to a generic source install. In my
experience, Solaris packages tend to be hard to find.<a name="INDEX-3002" /></a><a name="INDEX-3003" /></a>
