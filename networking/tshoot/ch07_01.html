<a name="INDEX-1608" /></a><a name="INDEX-1609" /></a><a name="INDEX-1610" /></a><a name="INDEX-1611" /></a>This chapter
is about monitoring devices with <em class="emphasis">Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP)</em>. It describes how SNMP can be used to
retrieve information from remote systems, to monitor systems, and to
alert you to problems. While other network management protocols
exist, SNMP is currently the most commonly used. While SNMP has other
uses, our primary focus will be on monitoring systems to ensure that
they are functioning properly and to collect information when they
aren't. The material in this chapter is expanded upon in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Performance Measurement Tools"</a>. 
</p><p>

This chapter begins with a brief review of SNMP. This description is
somewhat informal but should serve to convey enough of the basic
ideas to get you started if you are unfamiliar with SNMP. If you are
already familiar with the basic concepts and vocabulary, you can
safely skip over this section. Next I describe NET SNMP -- a
wonderful tool for learning about SNMP that can be used for many
simple tasks. Network monitoring using <em class="filename">tkined</em> is
next, followed by a few pointers to tools for Microsoft Windows.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="nettroubletools-CHP-7-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">7.1. Overview of SNMP</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1612" /></a><a name="INDEX-1613" /></a><a name="INDEX-1614" /></a><a name="INDEX-1615" /></a><a name="INDEX-1616" /></a>SNMP is a management protocol allowing
a management program to communicate, configure, or control remote
devices that have embedded SNMP agents. The basic idea behind SNMP is
to have a program or <em class="emphasis">agent</em> running on the remote
system that you can communicate with over the network. This
<em class="emphasis">agent</em> then can monitor systems and collect
information. Software on a management station sends messages to the
remote agent requesting information or directing it to perform some
specific task. While communication is usually initiated by the
management station, under certain conditions the agent may send an
unsolicited message or <em class="emphasis">trap</em> back to the
management station.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1617" /></a><a name="INDEX-1618" /></a>SNMP provides a framework for network
management. While SNMP is not the only management protocol or,
arguably, even the best management protocol, SNMP is almost
universal. It has a small footprint, can be implemented fairly
quickly, is extensible, is well documented, and is an open standard.
It resides at the application level of the TCP/IP protocol suite. On
the other hand, SNMP, particularly Version 1, is not a secure
protocol; it is poorly suited for real-time applications, and it can
return an overwhelming amount of information.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1619" /></a>SNMP is
an evolving protocol with a confusing collection of abbreviations
designating the various versions. Only the major versions are
mentioned here. Understanding the major distinctions among versions
can be important, because there are a few things you can't do
with earlier versions and because of differences in security provided
by the different versions. However, the original version, SNMPv1, is
still widely used and will be the primary focus of this chapter.
Generally, the later versions are backward compatible, so differences
in versions shouldn't cause too many operational problems.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1620" /></a><a name="INDEX-1621" /></a><a name="INDEX-1622" /></a><a name="INDEX-1623" /></a>The
second version has several competing variants. SNMPv2 Classic has
been superseded by community-based SNMPv2 or SNMPv2c. Two more secure
super-sets of SNMPv2c are SNMPv2u and SNMPv2*. SNMPv2c is the most
common of the second versions and is what is usually meant when you
see a reference to SNMPv2. SNMPv2 has not been widely adopted, but
its use is growing. SNMP-NG or SNMPv3 attempts to resolve the
differences between SNMPv2u and SNMPv2*. It is too soon to predict
how successful SNMPv3 will be, but it also appears to be growing in
popularity.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1624" /></a><a name="INDEX-1625" /></a><a name="INDEX-1626" /></a><a name="INDEX-1627" /></a>Although there are usually
legitimate reasons for the choice of terms, the nomenclature used to
describe SNMP can be confusing. For example, parameters that are
monitored are frequently referred to as <em class="emphasis">objects,</em>
although <em class="emphasis">variables</em> might have been a better
choice and is sometimes used. Basically, objects can be thought of as
data structures.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1628" /></a><a name="INDEX-1629" /></a><a name="INDEX-1630" /></a>Sometimes, the specialized
nomenclature doesn't seem to be worth the effort. For example,
SNMP uses <em class="emphasis">community strings</em> to control access.
In order to gain access to a device, you must give the community
string. If this sounds a lot like a password to you, you are not
alone. The primary difference is the way community strings are used.
The same community strings are often shared by a group or community
of devices, something frowned upon with passwords. Their purpose is
more to logically group devices than to provide security.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1631" /></a><a name="INDEX-1632" /></a><a name="INDEX-1633" /></a><a name="INDEX-1634" /></a><a name="INDEX-1635" /></a><a name="INDEX-1636" /></a><a name="INDEX-1637" /></a>An SNMP
<em class="emphasis">manager</em>, software on a central management
platform, communicates with an SNMP <em class="emphasis">agent</em>,
software located in the managed device, through SNMP
<em class="emphasis">messages</em>. With SNMPv1 there are five types of
messages. GET_REQUEST, GET_NEXT_REQUEST, and SET_REQUEST are sent by
the manager to the agent to request an action. In the first two
cases, the agent is asked to supply information, such as the value of
an object. The SET_REQUEST message asks the agent to change the value
of an object.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1638" /></a><a name="INDEX-1639" /></a><a name="INDEX-1640" /></a>The remaining messages,
GET_RESPONSE and TRAP, originate at the agent. The agent replies to
the first three messages with the GET_RESPONSE message. In each case,
the exchange is initiated by the manager. With the TRAP message, the
action is initiated by the agent. Like a hardware interrupt on a
computer, the TRAP message is the agent's way of getting the
attention of the manager. Traps play an essential role in network
management in that they alert you to problems needing attention.
Knowing that a device is down is, of course, the first step to
correcting the problem. And it always helps to be able to tell a
disgruntled user that you are aware of the problem and are working on
it. Traps are as close as SNMP gets to real-time processing.
Unfortunately, for many network problems (such as a crashed system)
traps may not be sent. Even when traps are sent, they could be
discarded by a busy router. UDP is the transport protocol, so there
is no error detection for lost packets. <a href="ch07_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-7-FIG-1">Figure 7-1</a>
summarizes the direction messages take when traveling between the
manager and agent.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-7-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="118" alt="Figure 7-1" src="figs/ntt_0701.gif" width="331" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 7-1. SNMP messages</h4>

<a name="INDEX-1641" /></a><a name="INDEX-1642" /></a>For a management station to send a packet,
it must know the IP address of the agent, the appropriate community
string or password used by the agent, and the name of the identifier
for the variable or object referenced. Unfortunately, SNMPv1 is very
relaxed about community strings. These are sent in clear text and can
easily be captured by a packet sniffer. One of the motivating factors
for SNMPv2 was to provide greater security. Be warned, however,
SNMPv2c uses plain text community strings.
<a name="INDEX-1643" /></a><a name="INDEX-1644" /></a><a name="INDEX-1645" /></a>
</p><p>


<a name="ch07-4-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>TIP: </b>
Most systems, by default, use
<tt class="literal">public</tt> for the read-only community string and
<tt class="literal">private</tt> for the read/write community string. When
you set up SNMP access on a device, you will be given the opportunity
to change these. If you don't want your system to be
reconfigurable by anyone on the Internet, you should change these.
When communicating with devices, use read-only community strings
whenever possible and read/write community strings only when
necessary. Use filters to block all SNMP traffic into or out of your
network. Most agents will also allow you to restrict which devices
you can send and receive SNMP messages to and from. Do this! For
simplicity and clarity, the examples in this chapter have been edited
to use <tt class="literal">public</tt> and <tt class="literal">private</tt>.
These are not the community strings I actually use.
</p><p>
</blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1646" /></a><a name="INDEX-1647" /></a><a name="INDEX-1648" /></a>Another advantage to SNMPv2 is
that two additional messages have been added. GET_BULK_REQUEST will
request multiple pieces of data with a single query, whereas
GET_REQUEST generates a separate request for each piece of data. This
can considerably improve performance. The other new message,
INFORM_REQUEST, allows one manager to send unsolicited information to
another.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1649" /></a><a name="INDEX-1650" /></a><a name="INDEX-1651" /></a><a name="INDEX-1652" /></a><a name="INDEX-1653" /></a><a name="INDEX-1654" /></a><a name="INDEX-1655" /></a><a name="INDEX-1656" /></a><a name="INDEX-1657" /></a>Collectively, the
objects are variables defined in the <em class="emphasis">Management Information
Base</em> (MIB). Unfortunately, MIB is an overused term that
means slightly different things in different contexts. There are some
formal rules for dealing with MIBs -- MIB formats are defined by
<em class="emphasis">Structure of Management Information</em> (SMI), the
syntax rules for MIB entries are described in <em class="emphasis">Abstract
Syntax Notation One</em> (ASN.1), and how the syntax is encoded
is given by <em class="emphasis">Basic Encoding Rules</em> (BER). Unless
you are planning to delve into the implementation of SNMP or decode
hex dumps, you can postpone learning SMI, ASN.1, and BER. And because
of the complexity of these rules, I advise against looking at hex
dumps. Fortunately, programs like <em class="filename">ethereal</em> do a
good job of decoding these packets, so I won't discuss these
rules in this book.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1658" /></a><a name="INDEX-1659" /></a><a name="INDEX-1660" /></a><a name="INDEX-1661" /></a>The actual
objects that are manipulated are identified by a unique,
authoritative <em class="emphasis">object identifier</em> (OID). Each OID
is actually a sequence of integers separated by decimal points,
sometimes called <em class="emphasis">dotted notation</em>. For example,
the OID for a system's description is
<em class="filename">1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1</em>. This OID arises from the
standardized organization of all such objects, part of which is shown
in <a href="ch07_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a>. The actual objects are the leaves of
the tree. To eliminate any possibility of ambiguity among objects,
they are named by giving their complete path from the root of the
tree to the leaf.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-7-FIG-2" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="307" alt="Figure 7-2" src="figs/ntt_0702.gif" width="484" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 7-2. Partial OID structure</h4>

<a name="INDEX-1662" /></a><a name="INDEX-1663" /></a><a name="INDEX-1664" /></a>As you can see from the figure, nodes are
given both names and numbers. Thus, the OID can also be given by
specifying the names of each node or <em class="emphasis">object
descriptor</em>. For example,
<em class="filename">iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr</em>
is the object descriptor that corresponds to the object identifier
<em class="filename">1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1</em>. The more concise numerical
names are used within the agents and within messages. The nonnumeric
names are used at the management station for the convenience of
users. Objects are coded directly into the agents and manipulated by
object descriptors. While management stations can mechanically handle
object descriptors, they must be explicitly given the mappings
between object descriptors and object identifiers if you want to call
objects by name. This is one role of the MIB files that ship with
devices and load onto the management station. These files also tell
the management station which identifiers are valid.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1665" /></a><a name="INDEX-1666" /></a><a name="INDEX-1667" /></a>As you might guess from
<a href="ch07_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a>, this is not a randomly created tree.
Through the standardization process, a number of identifiers have
been specified. In particular, the <em class="filename">mib-2</em> subtree
has a number of subtrees or <em class="emphasis">groups</em> of interest.
The <em class="filename">system</em> group,
<em class="filename">1.3.6.1.2.1.1</em>, has nodes used to describe the
system such as <em class="filename">sysDescr(1)</em>,
<em class="filename">sysObjectID(2)</em>,
<em class="filename">sysUpTime(3)</em>, and so on. These should be pretty
self-explanatory. Although not shown in the figure, the
<em class="filename">ip(4)</em> group has a number of objects such as
<em class="filename">ipForwarding(1)</em>, which indicates whether IP
packets will be forwarded, and <em class="filename">ipDefaultTTL(2)</em>,
which gives the default TTL when it isn't specified by the
transport layer. The <em class="filename">ip</em> group also has three
tables including the <em class="filename">ipRouteTable(20)</em>. While
this information can be gleaned from RFC 1213, which defines the MIB,
several books that present this material in a more accessible form
are listed in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Resources and References"</a>. Fortunately, there are
tools that can be used to investigate MIBs directly.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1668" /></a><a name="INDEX-1669" /></a><a name="INDEX-1670" /></a>In addition to standard entries,
companies may register private or <em class="emphasis">enterprise</em>
MIBs. These have extensions specific to their equipment. Typically,
these MIBs must be added to those on the management station if they
are not already there. They are usually shipped with the device or
can be downloaded over the Internet. Each company registers for a
node under the <em class="filename">enterprises</em> node
(<em class="filename">1.3.6.1.4.1</em>). These extensions are under their
respective registered nodes.
</p><p>

If you are new to SNMP, this probably seems pretty abstract. <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Resources and References"</a> also lists and discusses a number of sources
that describe the theory and architecture of SNMP in greater detail.
But you should know enough at this point to get started. The best way
to come to terms with SNMP and the structure of managed objects is by
experimentation, and that requires tools. I will try to clarify some
of these concepts as we examine SNMP management tools.<a name="INDEX-1671" /></a>
