<h2 class="sect1">8.4. Network-Monitoring Tools</h2>

<a name="INDEX-2072" /><a name="INDEX-2073" /><a name="INDEX-2074" /><a name="INDEX-2075" /><a name="INDEX-2076" /><a name="INDEX-2077" /><a name="INDEX-2078" /><a name="INDEX-2079" /><a name="INDEX-2080" />It should come as no surprise
that SNMP can be used to collect performance information. We have
already seen simple examples in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Device Monitoring with SNMP"</a>. Using
the raw statistics gathered with a tool like NET SNMP or even the
stripcharts in <em class="filename">tkined</em> is alright if you need
only a little data, but in practice you will want tools designed to
deal specifically with performance data. Which tool you use will
depend on what you want to do. One of your best choices from this
family of tools is <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. (Although it is not
discussed here, you also may want to look at
<em class="filename">scion</em>. This is from Merit Networks, Inc., and
will run under Windows as well as Unix.)
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-8-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.1. mrtg</h3>

<em class="filename">mrtg (Multirouter Traffic Grapher)</em><a name="INDEX-2081" /><a name="INDEX-2082" /><a name="INDEX-2083" /><a name="INDEX-2084" /><a name="INDEX-2085" /><a name="INDEX-2086" /><a name="INDEX-2087" /> was originally developed by Tobias
Oetiker with the support of numerous people, most notably Dave Rand.
This tool uses SNMP to collect statistics from network equipment and
creates web-accessible graphs of the statistics. It is designed to be
run periodically to provide a picture of traffic over time.
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> is ideally suited for identifying busy-hour
traffic. All you need to do is scan the graph looking for the largest
peaks.
</p>

<em class="emphasis">mrtg</em> is most commonly used to graph traffic
through router interfaces but can be configured for other uses. For
example, since NET SNMP can be used to collect disk usage data,
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> could be used to retrieve and graph the
amount of free space on the disk drive over time for a system running
<em class="filename">snmpd</em>. Because the graphs are web-accessible,
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> is well suited for remote measurement.
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> uses SNMP's GET command to collect
information. With the current implementation, collection is done by a
Perl module supplied as part of <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. No
separate installation of SNMP is needed.
</p>

<em class="filename">mrtg</em><a name="INDEX-2088" /><a name="INDEX-2089" /><a name="INDEX-2090" /><a name="INDEX-2091" /><a name="INDEX-2092" /><a name="INDEX-2093" /><a name="INDEX-2094" /><a name="INDEX-2095" /> is designed to be run regularly by
<em class="filename">cron</em>, typically every five minutes. However,
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> can be run as a standalone program, or the
sampling interval can be changed. Configuration files, generally
created with the <em class="filename">cfgmaker</em> utility, determine the
general appearance of the web pages and what data is collected.
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> generates graphs of traffic in GIF format
and HTML pages to display these graphs. Typically, these will be made
available by a web server running on the same computer as
<em class="filename">mrtg</em>, but the files can be viewed with a web
browser running on the same computer or the files can be moved to
another computer for viewing. This could be helpful when debugging
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> since the web server may considerably
complicate the installation, particularly if you are not currently
running a web server or are not comfortable with web server
configuration.
</p>

<a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-6">Figure 8-6</a> shows a typical web page generated by
<em class="filename">mrtg</em>. In this example, you can see some basic
information about the router at the top of the page and, below it,
two graphs. One shows traffic for the last 24 hours and the other
shows traffic for the last two weeks, along with summary statistics
for each. The monthly and yearly graphs have scrolled off the page.
This is the output for a single interface. Input traffic is shown in
green and output traffic is shown in blue, by default, on color
displays.
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="507" alt="Figure 8-6" src="figs/ntt_0806.gif" width="460" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-6. mrtg interface report</h4>

<a name="INDEX-2096" /><a name="INDEX-2097" /><a name="INDEX-2098" />It is possible to have
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> generate a summary web page with a graph
for each interface. Each graph is linked to the more complete traffic
report such as the one shown in <a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-6">Figure 8-6</a>. The
<em class="filename">indexmaker</em> utility is used to generate this page
once the configuration file has been
created.<a name="INDEX-2099" />
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.4.1.1. mrtg configuration file</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2100" /><a name="INDEX-2101" /><a name="INDEX-2102" /><a name="INDEX-2103" /><a name="INDEX-2104" />To use <em class="filename">mrtg</em>, you
will need a separate configuration file for each device. Each
configuration file will describe all the interfaces within the
device. Creating these files is the first step after installation.
While a sample configuration file is supplied as part of the
documentation, it is much easier to use the
<em class="filename">cfgmaker</em> script. An SNMP community string and
hostname or IP number must be supplied as parts to a compound
argument:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# cfgmaker public@172.16.2.1 &gt; mrtg.cfg</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2105" /><a name="INDEX-2106" />Since the
script writes the configuration to standard output, you'll need
to redirect your output to a file. If you want to measure traffic at
multiple devices, then you simply need to create a different
configuration file for each. Just give each a different (but
meaningful) name.
</p>

Once you have a basic configuration file, you can further edit it as
you see fit. As described next, this can be an involved process.
Fortunately, <em class="filename">cfgmaker</em> does a reasonable job. In
many cases, this will provide all you need, so further editing
won't be necessary.
</p>

Here is the first part of a fairly typical configuration file. (You
may want to compare this to the sample output shown in <a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-6">Figure 8-6</a>.)

<a name="INDEX-2107" />As you can see from the example, the
general format of a directive is <em class="replaceable">Keyword[Label]:
Arguments</em><em class="emphasis">.</em> Directives always start
in the first column of the configuration file. Their arguments may
extend over multiple lines, provided the additional lines leave the
first column blank. In the example, the argument to the first
<em class="filename">PageTop</em> directive extends for 10 lines.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2108" /><a name="INDEX-2109" /><a name="INDEX-2110" /><a name="INDEX-2111" />In this example, I've added the
second line -- specifying a directory where the working files will
be stored. This is a mandatory change. It should be set to a
directory that is accessible to the web server on the computer. It
will contain log files, home pages, and graphs for the most recent
day, week, month, and year for each interface. The interface label,
explained shortly, is the first part of a filename. Filename
extensions identify the function of each file.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2112" />Everything else, including the
files just described, is automatically generated. As you can see,
<em class="filename">cfgmaker</em> uses SNMP to collect some basic
information from the device, e.g., <em class="filename">sysName</em>,
<em class="filename">sysLocation</em>, and
<em class="filename">sysContact</em>, for inclusion in the configuration
file. This information has been used both in the initial comment
(lines beginning with <tt class="literal">#</tt>) and in the HTML code
under the <em class="filename">PageTop</em> directive. As you might guess,
<em class="filename">PageTop</em> determines what is displayed at the top
of the page in <a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-6">Figure 8-6</a>.
</p>

<em class="filename">cfgmaker</em><a name="INDEX-2113" /><a name="INDEX-2114" /><a name="INDEX-2115" /><a name="INDEX-2116" /> also determines the type of
interface by retrieving <em class="filename">ifType</em> and its maximum
operating speed by retrieving <em class="filename">ifSpeed</em>,
<tt class="literal">ethernetCsmacd</tt> and <tt class="literal">125.0</tt>
<tt class="literal">kBytes/s</tt> in this example. The interface type is
used by the <em class="filename">PageTop</em> directive. The speed is used
by both <em class="filename">PageTop</em> and the
<em class="filename">MaxBytes</em> directive. The
<em class="filename">MaxBytes</em> directive determines the maximum value
that a measured variable is allowed to reach. If a larger number is
retrieved, it is ignored. This is given in bytes per second, so if
you think in bits per second, don't be misled.
</p>

<em class="filename">cfgmaker</em><a name="INDEX-2117" /><a name="INDEX-2118" />
collects information on each interface and creates a section in the
configuration file for each. Only two interfaces are shown in this
fragment, but the omitted sections are quite similar. Each section
will begin with the <em class="filename">Target</em> directive. In this
example, the first interface is identified with the directive
<tt class="literal">Target[C3600]:</tt>
<tt class="literal">1:public@172.16.2.1</tt>. The interface was identified
by the initial scan by <em class="filename">cfgmaker</em>. The label was
obtained by doing name resolution on the IP address. In this case, it
came from an entry in <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-34">[34]</a> If name resolution fails, the IP and port numbers will be
used as a label. The argument to <em class="filename">Target</em> is a
combination of the port number, SNMP community string, and IP address
of the interface. You should be aware that adding or removing an
interface in a monitored device without updating the configuration
file can lead to bogus results.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-34" />[34]In this example, a different system name and hostname are used
to show where each is used. This is not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

The only other directive in this example is
<em class="filename">Title</em>, which determines the title displayed for
the HTML page. These examples are quite adequate for a simple page,
but <em class="filename">mrtg</em> provides both additional directives and
additional arguments that provide a great deal of flexibility.
</p>

By default, <em class="filename">mrtg</em> collects the SNMP objects
<em class="filename">ifInOctets</em> and <em class="filename">ifOutOctets</em>
for each interface. This can be changed with the
<em class="filename">Target</em> command. Here is an example of a small
test file (the recommended way to test <em class="filename">mrtg</em>)
that is used to collect the number of unicast and nonunicast packets
at an interface.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# cat test.cfg
WorkDir: /usr/local/share/doc/apache/mrtg

 &lt;/H1&gt;
 &lt;TABLE&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;System:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;NLRouter in "LL 214"&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Maintainer:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;"Joe Sloan"&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Interface:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Ethernet0/0 (1)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;IP:&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;C3600 (205.153.60.250)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
   &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Max Speed:&lt;/TD&gt;
       &lt;TD&gt;1250.0 kBytes/s (ethernetCsmacd)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
  &lt;/TABLE&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<em class="filename">mrtg</em><a name="INDEX-2119" /><a name="INDEX-2120" /><a name="INDEX-2121" /> knows a limited number of OIDs. These are
described in the <em class="filename">mibhelp.txt</em> file that comes
with<em class="filename"> mrtg</em>. Fortunately, you can use dotted
notation as well, so you aren't limited to objects with known
identifiers. Nor do you have to worry about MIBs. You can also use an
expression in the place of an identifier, e.g., the sum of two OIDs,
or you can specify an external program if you wish to collect data
not available through SNMP. There are a number of additional formats
and options available with <em class="filename">Target.</em>
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2122" /><a name="INDEX-2123" />Other keywords are available that
will allow you to customize <em class="filename">mrtg</em>'s
behavior. For example, you can use the <em class="filename">Interval</em>
directive to change the reported frequency of sampling. You'll
also need to change your <em class="filename">crontab</em> file to match.
If you don't want to use <em class="filename">cron</em>, you can use
the <em class="filename">RunAsDaemon</em> directive, in conjunction with
the <em class="filename">Interval</em> directive to set
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> up to run as a standalone program.
<em class="filename">Interval </em>takes an argument in minutes; for
example, <tt class="literal">Interval:</tt> <tt class="literal">10</tt> would
sample every 10 minutes. To enable <em class="filename">mrtg</em> to run
as a stand-alone program, the syntax is<em class="filename">
</em><tt class="literal">RunAsDaemon:</tt><em class="filename">
</em><tt class="literal">yes</tt>.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2124" /><a name="INDEX-2125" /><a name="INDEX-2126" /><a name="INDEX-2127" /><a name="INDEX-2128" />Several directives are useful
for controlling the appearance of your graphs. If you don't
want all four graphs, you can suppress the display of selected graphs
with the <em class="filename">Suppress</em> directive. For example,
<tt class="literal">Suppress[Testing]:</tt><em class="filename">
</em><tt class="literal">my</tt> will suppress the monthly and yearly
graphs. Use <em class="filename">d</em> and <em class="filename">w</em> for
daily and weekly graphs. You may use whatever combination you want.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2129" />One
annoyance with <em class="filename">mrtg</em> is that it scales each graph
to the largest value that has to be plotted.
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> shouldn't be faulted for this; it is
simply using what information it has. But the result can be graphs
with some very unusual vertical scales and sets of graphs that you
can't easily compare. This is something you'll definitely
want to adjust.
</p>

You can work around this problem with several of the directives
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> provides, but the approach you choose will
depend, at least in part, on the behavior of the data you are
collecting. The <em class="filename">Unscaled</em> directive suppresses
automatic scaling of data. It uses the value from
<em class="filename">MaxBytes</em> as maximum on the vertical scale. You
can edit <em class="filename">MaxBytes</em> if you are willing to have
data go off the top of the graph. If you change this, you should use
<em class="filename">AbsMax</em> to set the largest value that you expect
to see.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2130" /><a name="INDEX-2131" />Other commands allow you to change the
color, size, shape, and background of your graphs. You can also
change the directions that graphs grow. Here is an example that
changes the display of data to bits per second, has the display grow
from left to right, displays only the daily and weekly graphs, and
sets the vertical scale to 4000 bits per second:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Options[Testing]: growright,bits
Suppress[Testing]: my
MaxBytes[Testing]: 500
AbsMax[Testing]: 1250000
Unscaled[Testing]: dw</pre></blockquote>

Notice that you still need to give <em class="filename">MaxBytes</em> and
<em class="filename">AbsMax</em> in bytes.
</p>

Many more keywords are available. Only the most common have been
described here, but these should be more than enough to meet your
initial needs. See the mrtg sample configuration file and
documentation for others.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2132" />Once you have the configuration file, use
<em class="filename">indexmaker</em> to create a main page for all the
interfaces on a device. In its simplest form, you merely give the
configuration file and the destination file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# indexmaker mrtg.cfg &gt; /usr/local/www/data/mrtg/index.html</pre></blockquote>

You may specify a router name and a regular expression that will
match a subset of the interfaces if you want to limit what you are
looking at. For example, if you have a switch with a large number of
ports, you may want to monitor only the uplink ports.
</p>

You'll probably want to run <em class="filename">mrtg</em> manually
a couple of times. Here is an example using the configuration file
<em class="filename">test.cfg</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd2# mrtg test.cfg
Rateup WARNING: .//rateup could not read the primary log file for testing
Rateup WARNING: .//rateup The backup log file for testing was invalid as well
Rateup WARNING: .//rateup Can't remove testing.old updating log file
Rateup WARNING: .//rateup Can't rename testing.log to testing.old updating log f
ile</pre></blockquote>

The first couple of runs will generate warning messages about missing
log files and the like. These should go away after a couple of runs
and can be safely ignored<em class="emphasis">.</em>
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2133" />Finally,
you'll want to make an appropriate entry in your
<em class="filename">contab</em> file. For example, this entry will run
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> every five minutes on a FreeBSD system:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /usr/ports/net/mrtg/work/mrtg-2.8.12/r
un/mrtg /usr/ports/net/mrtg/work/mrtg-2.8.12/run/mrtg.cfg &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</pre></blockquote>

This should be all on a single line. The syntax is different on some
systems, such as Linux, so be sure to check your local manpages.

<h3 class="sect2">8.4.2. rrd and the Future of mrtg</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2134" /><a name="INDEX-2135" /><a name="INDEX-2136" />The original version of
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> had two deficiencies, a lack of both
scalability and portability. Originally, <em class="filename">mrtg</em>
was able to support only about 20 routers or switches. It used
external utilities to perform SNMP queries and create GIF
images -- <em class="filename">snmpget</em> from CMU SNMP and
<em class="filename">pnmtogif</em> from the PBM package, respectively.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2137" /><a name="INDEX-2138" />These issues were addressed by MRTG-2,
the second and current version of <em class="filename">mrtg</em>.
Performance was improved when Dave Rand contributed
<em class="filename">rateup</em> to the project. Written in C,
<em class="filename">rateup</em> improved both graph generation and
handling of the log files.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2139" /><a name="INDEX-2140" /><a name="INDEX-2141" /><a name="INDEX-2142" />The portability problem was addressed by
two changes. First, Simon Leinen's Perl script for collecting
SNMP is now used, eliminating the need for CMU SNMP. Second, Thomas
Boutell's GD library is now used to directly generate graphics.
At this point, <em class="filename">mrtg</em> is said to reasonably
support querying 500 ports on a regular basis.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2143" />As an ongoing project, the next goal is to
further improve performance and flexibility. Toward this goal, Tobias
Oetiker has written <em class="filename">rrd (Round Robin Database)</em>,
a program to further optimize the database and the graphing portion
of <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. Although MRTG-3, the next version of
<em class="filename">mrtg</em>, is not complete, <em class="filename">rrd</em>
has been completed and is available as a standalone program. MRTG-3
will be built on top of <em class="filename">rrd</em>.
</p>

<em class="filename">rrd</em><a name="INDEX-2144" /> is designed to store and
display time-series data. It is written in C and is available under
the GNU General Public License. <em class="filename">rrd</em> stores data
in a round-robin fashion so that older data is condensed and
eventually discarded. Consequently, the size of the database
stabilizes and will not continue to grow over time.<a name="INDEX-2145" /><a name="INDEX-2146" />

<h3 class="sect2">8.4.3. cricket</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2147" /><a name="INDEX-2148" /><a name="INDEX-2149" /><a name="INDEX-2150" />A number of frontends are available for
<em class="filename">rrd,</em> including Jeff Allen's
<em class="filename">cricket</em>. Allen, working at WebTV, was using
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> but found that it really wasn't
adequate to support the 9000 targets he needed to manage. Rather than
wait for MRTG-3, he developed <em class="filename">cricket</em>. At least
superficially, <em class="filename">cricket</em> has basically the same
uses as <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. But <em class="filename">cricket</em>
has been designed to be much more scalable.
<em class="filename">cricket</em> is organized around the concept of a
configuration tree. The configuration files for devices are organized
in a hierarchical manner so the general device properties can be
defined once at a higher level and inherited, while exceptions can be
simply defined at a lower level of the hierarchy. This makes
<em class="filename">cricket</em> much more manageable for larger
organizations with large numbers of devices. Since it is designed
around <em class="filename">rrd</em>, <em class="filename">cricket</em> is also
much more efficient.
</p>

<em class="filename">cricket</em><a name="INDEX-2151" /><a name="INDEX-2152" /><a name="INDEX-2153" /><a name="INDEX-2154" /><a name="INDEX-2155" /> does a very nice job of
organizing the pages that it displays. To access the pages, you will
begin by executing the <em class="filename">grapher.cgi</em> script on the
server. For example, if the server were at
<em class="emphasis">172.16.2.236</em> and CGI scripts were in the
<em class="filename">cgi-bin</em> directory, you would point your browser
to the URL
<em class="filename">http://172.16.2.236/cgi-bin/grapher.cgi</em>. This
will present you with a page organized around types of devices, e.g.,
routers, router interfaces, switches, along with descriptions of
each. From this you will select the type of device you want to
monitor. Depending on your choice, you may be presented with a list
of monitored devices items or with another subhierarchy such as that
shown in <a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-7">Figure 8-7</a>.
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-7" /><div class="figure"><img height="492" alt="Figure 8-7" src="figs/ntt_0807.gif" width="460" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-7. cricket router interfaces</h4>

You can quickly drill down to the traffic graph for the device of
interest. <a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-8">Figure 8-8</a> shows an example of a traffic
graph for a router interface on a router during a period of very low
usage (but you get the idea, I hope).
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-8" /><div class="figure"><img height="545" alt="Figure 8-8" src="figs/ntt_0808.gif" width="460" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-8. Traffic on a single interface</h4>

<a name="INDEX-2156" /><a name="INDEX-2157" /><a name="INDEX-2158" /><a name="INDEX-2159" />As you can see, this looks an awful lot
like the graphs from <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. Unlike with
<em class="filename">mrtg</em>, you have some control over which graphs
are displayed from the web page. Short-Term displays both hourly and
daily graphs, Long-Term displays both weekly and monthly graphs, and
Hourly, Daily, and All are just what you would expect.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-35">[35]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-35" />[35]<em class="filename">mrtg </em>uses Daily to mean an hour-by-hour
plot for 24 hours. <em class="filename">cricket </em>uses Hourly to mean
the same thing. This shouldn't cause any problems.</p>
</blockquote>

Of course, you will need to configure each option for
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> to work correctly. You will need to go
through the hierarchy and identify the appropriate targets, set SNMP
community strings, and add any descriptions that you want. Here is
the <em class="filename">interfaces</em> file in the
<em class="filename">router-interfaces</em> subdirectory of the
<em class="filename">cricket-config</em> directory, the directory that
contains the configuration tree. (This file corresponds to the output
shown in <a href="ch08_04.html#nettroubletools-CHP-8-FIG-8">Figure 8-8</a>.)
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">target --default--
        router = NLCisco
        snmp-community=public

target Ethernet0_0
        interface-name  =       Ethernet0/0
        short-desc      =       "Gateway to Internet"

target Ethernet0_1
        interface-name  =       Ethernet0/1
        short-desc      =       "172.16.1.0/24 subnet"

target Ethernet0_2
        interface-name  =       Ethernet0/2
        short-desc      =       "172.16.2.0/24 subnet"

target Ethernet0_3
        interface-name  =       Ethernet0/3
        short-desc      =       "172.16.3.0/24 subnet"

target Null0
        interface-name  =       Null0
        short-desc      =       ""</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2160" /><a name="INDEX-2161" />While this may look simpler than an
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> configuration file, you'll be dealing
with a large number of these files. If you make a change to the
configuration tree, you will need to recompile the configuration tree
before you run <em class="filename">cricket</em>. As with
<em class="filename">mrtg</em>, you will need to edit your
<em class="filename">crontab</em> file to execute the
<em class="filename">collector</em> script on a regular basis.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2162" /><a name="INDEX-2163" />On the whole,
<em class="filename">cricket</em> is considerably more difficult to learn
and to configure than <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. One way that
<em class="filename">cricket</em> gains efficiency is by using CGI scripts
to generate web pages only when they are needed rather than after
each update. The result is that the pages are not available unless
you have a web server running on the same computer that
<em class="filename">cricket</em> is running on. Probably the most
difficult part of the <em class="filename">cricket</em> installation is
setting up your web server and the <em class="filename">cricket</em>
directory structure so that the scripts can be executed by the web
server without introducing any security holes. Setting up a web
server and web security are beyond the scope of this book.
</p>

Unless you have such a large installation that
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> doesn't meet your needs, my advice
would be to start with <em class="filename">mrtg</em>. It's nice to
know that <em class="filename">cricket</em> is out there. And if you
really need it, it is a solid package worth learning. But
<em class="filename">mrtg</em> is easier to get started with and will meet
most people's needs.<a name="INDEX-2164" /><a name="INDEX-2165" /><a name="INDEX-2166" /><a name="INDEX-2167" /><a name="INDEX-2168" /> <a name="INDEX-2169" /><a name="INDEX-2170" /><a name="INDEX-2171" /><a name="INDEX-2172" /><a name="INDEX-2173" />
