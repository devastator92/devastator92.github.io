In the last chapter, we attempted to answer a fundamental question,
"Do we have a working network connection?" We used tools
such as <em class="filename">ping</em> to verify basic connectivity. But
simple connectivity is not enough for many purposes. For example, an
ISP can provide connectivity but not meet your needs or expectations.
If your ISP is not providing the level of service you think it
should, you will need something to base your complaints on. Or, if
the performance of your local network isn't adequate, you will
want to determine where the bottlenecks are located before you start
implementing expensive upgrades. In this chapter, we will try to
answer the question, "Is our connection performing
reasonably?"
</p><p>

We will begin by looking at ways to determine which links or
individual connections compose a path. This discussion focuses on the
tool <em class="filename">traceroute</em>. Next, we will turn to several
tools that allow us to identify those links along a path that might
cause problems. Once we have identified individual links of interest,
we will examine some simple ways to further characterize the
performance of those links, including estimating the bandwidth of a
connection and measuring the available throughput.

<h2 class="sect1">4.1. Path Discovery with traceroute</h2>

<a name="INDEX-665" /></a><a name="INDEX-666" /></a><a name="INDEX-667" /></a><a name="INDEX-668" /></a><a name="INDEX-669" /></a>This section describes
<em class="filename">traceroute</em>, a tool used to discover the links
along a path. While this is the first step in investigating a
path's behavior and performance, it is useful for other tasks
as well. In the previous discussion of <em class="filename">ping</em>, it
was suggested that you work your way, hop by hop, toward a device you
can't reach to discover the point of failure. This assumes that
you know the path.
</p><p>

Path discovery is also an essential step in diagnosing routing
problems. While you may fully understand the structure of your
network and know what path you want your packets to take through your
network, knowing the path your packets actually take is essential
information and may come as a surprise.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-670" /></a><a name="INDEX-671" /></a>Once packets leave your network,
you have almost no control over the path they actually take to their
destination. You may know very little about the structure of adjacent
networks. Path discovery can provide a way to discover who their ISP
is, how your ISP is connected to the world, and other information
such as peering arrangements. <em class="filename">traceroute</em> is the
tool of choice for collecting this kind of information.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-672" /></a><a name="INDEX-673" /></a>The <em class="filename">traceroute</em>
program was written by Van Jacobson and others. It is based on a
clever use of the <em class="emphasis">Time-To-Live</em> (TTL) field in
the IP packet's header. The TTL field, described briefly in the
last chapter, is used to limit the life of a packet. When a router
fails or is misconfigured, a routing loop or circular path may
result. The TTL field prevents packets from remaining on a network
indefinitely should such a routing loop occur. A packet's TTL
field is decremented each time the packet crosses a router on its way
through a network. When its value reaches 0, the packet is discarded
rather than forwarded. When discarded, an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED message
is sent back to the packet's source to inform the source that
the packet was discarded. By manipulating the TTL field of the
original packet, the program <em class="filename">traceroute</em> uses
information from these ICMP messages to discover paths through a
network.
</p><p>

<em class="filename">traceroute</em><a name="INDEX-674" /></a><a name="INDEX-675" /></a> sends a series of UDP packets with the
destination address of the device you want a path to.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-16">[16]</a> By default,
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> sends sets of three packets to
discover each hop. <em class="filename">traceroute</em> sets the TTL field
in the first three packets to a value of 1 so that they are discarded
by the first router on the path. When the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED messages
are returned by that router, <em class="filename">traceroute</em> records
the source IP address of these ICMP messages. This is the IP address
of the first hop on the route to the destination.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-16" /></a>[16]<em class="filename">tracert</em>, a Windows variant of
<em class="filename">traceroute</em>, uses ICMP rather than UDP.
<em class="filename">tracert</em> is discussed later in this
chapter.</p><p> </blockquote>

Next, three packets are sent with their TTL field set to 2. These
will be discarded by the second router on the path. The ICMP messages
returned by this router reveal the IP address of the second router on
the path. The program proceeds in this manner until a set of packets
finally has a TTL value large enough so that the packets reach their
destination.
</p><p>

Typically, when the probe packets finally have an adequate TTL and
reach their destination, they will be discarded and an ICMP
PORT_UNREACHABLE message will be returned. This happens because
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> sends all its probe packets with what
should be invalid port numbers, i.e., port numbers that aren't
usually used. To do this, <em class="filename">traceroute</em> starts with
a very large port number, typically 33434, and increments this value
with each subsequent packet. Thus, each of the three packets in a set
will have three different unlikely port numbers. The receipt of ICMP
PORT_UNREACHABLE messages is the signal that the end of the path has
been reached. Here is a simple example of using
<em class="filename">traceroute</em>:

<a name="INDEX-676" /></a><a name="INDEX-677" /></a><a name="INDEX-678" /></a>The results should be fairly
self-explanatory. This particular path was 16 hops long. Reverse name
lookup is attempted for the IP address of each device, and, if
successful, these names are reported in addition to IP addresses.
Times are reported for each of the three probes sent. They are
interpreted in the same way as times with <em class="filename">ping</em>.
(However, if you just want times for one hop,
<em class="filename">ping</em> is generally a better choice.)
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-679" /></a><a name="INDEX-680" /></a>Although no packets were lost in
this example, should a packet be lost, an asterisk is printed in the
place of the missing time. In some cases, all three times may be
replaced with asterisks. This can happen for several reasons. First,
the router at this hop may not return ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED messages.
Second, some older routers may incorrectly forward packets even
though the TTL is 0. A third possibility is that ICMP messages may be
given low priority and may not be returned in a timely manner.
Finally, beyond some point of the path, ICMP packets may be blocked.

<a name="INDEX-681" /></a><a name="INDEX-682" /></a><a name="INDEX-683" /></a><a name="INDEX-684" /></a><a name="INDEX-685" /></a>Other
routing problems may exist as well. In some instances
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> will append additional messages to
the end of lines in the form of an exclamation point and a letter.
<tt class="literal">!H</tt>, <tt class="literal">!N</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">!P</tt> indicate, respectively, that the host, network,
or protocol is unreachable. <tt class="literal">!F</tt> indicates that
fragmentation is needed. <tt class="literal">!S</tt> indicates a source
route failure.

<h3 class="sect2">4.1.1. Options</h3>

<a name="INDEX-686" /></a><a name="INDEX-687" /></a><a name="INDEX-688" /></a><a name="INDEX-689" /></a>Two options control how much information
is printed. Name resolution can be disabled with the
<em class="filename">-n</em> option. This can be useful if name resolution
fails for some reason or if you just don't want to wait on it.
The <em class="filename">-v</em> option is the verbose flag. With this
flag set, the source and packet sizes of the probes will be reported
for each packet. If other ICMP messages are received, they will also
be reported, so this can be an important option when troubleshooting.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-690" /></a><a name="INDEX-691" /></a>Several options may be used to alter the
behavior of <em class="filename">traceroute</em>, but most are rarely
needed. An example is the <em class="filename">-m</em> option. The TTL
field is an 8-bit number allowing a maximum of 255 hops. Most
implementations of <em class="filename">traceroute</em> default to trying
only 30 hops before halting. The <em class="filename">-m</em> option can
be used to change the maximum number of hops tested to any value up
to 255.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-692" /></a><a name="INDEX-693" /></a>As noted earlier,
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> usually receives a PORT_UNREACHABLE
message when it reaches its final destination because it uses a
series of unusually large port numbers as the destination ports.
Should the number actually match a port that has a running service,
the PORT_UNREACHABLE message will not be returned. This is rarely a
problem since three packets are sent with different port numbers,
but, if it is, the <em class="filename">-p</em> option lets you specify a
different starting port so these ports can be avoided.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-694" /></a><a name="INDEX-695" /></a><a name="INDEX-696" /></a>Normally, <em class="filename">traceroute</em>
sends three probe packets for each TTL value with a timeout of three
seconds for replies. The default number of packets per set can be
changed with the <em class="filename">-q</em> option. The default timeout
can be changed with the <em class="filename">-w</em> option.
</p><p>

Additional options support how packets are routed. See the manpage
for details on these if needed.

<h3 class="sect2">4.1.2. Complications with traceroute</h3>

<a name="INDEX-697" /></a>The
information <em class="filename">traceroute</em> supplies has its
limitations. In some situations, the results returned by
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> have a very short shelf life. This is
particularly true for long paths crossing several networks and ISPs.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-698" /></a><a name="INDEX-699" /></a>You should also recall that a
router, by definition, is a computer with multiple network
interfaces, each with a different IP address. This raises an obvious
question: which IP address should be returned for a router?
For<em class="filename"> traceroute</em>, the answer is dictated by the
mechanism it uses to discover the route. It can report only the
address of the interface receiving the packet. This means a quite
different path will be reported if <em class="filename">traceroute</em> is
run in the reverse direction.
</p><p>

Here is the output when the previous example is run again from what
was originally the destination to what was originally the source,
i.e., with the source and destination exchanged:

Trace complete.</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-700" /></a><a name="INDEX-701" /></a><a name="INDEX-702" /></a>There are several obvious differences.
First, the format is slightly different because this example was run
using Microsoft's implementation of
<em class="filename">traceroute</em>, <em class="filename">tracert</em>. This,
however, should present no difficulty.
</p><p>

A closer examination shows that there are more fundamental
differences. The second trace is not simply the first trace in
reverse order. The IP addresses are not the same, and the number of
hops is different.
</p><p>

There are two things going on here. First, as previously mentioned,
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> reports the IP number of the
interface where the packet arrives. The reverse path will use
different interfaces on each router, so different IP addresses will
be reported. While this can be a bit confusing at first glance, it
can be useful. By running <em class="filename">traceroute</em> at each end
of a connection, a much more complete picture of the connection can
be created.
</p><p>

<a href="ch04_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-4-FIG-1">Figure 4-1</a> shows the first six hops on the path
starting from the source for the first trace as reconstructed from
the pair of traces. We know the packet originates at
<em class="filename">205.153.61.178</em>. The first trace shows us the
first hop is <em class="filename">205.153.61.1</em>. It leaves this router
on interface <em class="filename">205.153.60.1</em> for
<em class="filename">205.153.60.2</em>. The second of these addresses is
just the next hop in the first trace. The first address comes from
the second trace. It is the last hop before the destination. It is
also reasonable in that we have two addresses that are part of the
same class C network. With IP networks, the ends of a link are part
of the link and must have IP numbers consistent with a single
network.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-4-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="435" alt="Figure 4-1" src="figs/ntt_0401.gif" width="191" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-1. First six hops on path </h4>

From the first trace, we know packets go from the
<em class="filename">205.153.60.2</em> to
<em class="filename">165.166.36.17</em>. From the reverse trace, we are
able to deduce that the other end of the
<em class="filename">165.166.36.17</em> link is
<em class="filename">165.166.36.18</em>. Or, equivalently, the outbound
interface for the <em class="filename">205.153.60.2</em> router has the
address <em class="filename">165.166.36.18</em>.
</p><p>

In the same manner, the next router's inbound interface is
<em class="filename">165.166.36.17,</em> and its outbound interface is
<em class="filename">165.166.36.34</em>. This can be a little confusing
since it appears that these last three addresses should be on the
same network. On closer examination of this link and adjacent links,
it appears that this class B address is using a subnet mask of
<em class="filename">/20</em>. With this assumption, the addresses are
consistent.
</p><p>

We can proceed in much the same manner to discover the next few
links. However, when we get to the seventh entry in the first trace
(or to the eighth entry working backward in the second trace), the
process breaks down. The reason is simple -- we have asymmetric
paths across the Internet. This also accounts for the difference in
the number of hops between the two traces.
</p><p>

In much the same way we mapped the near end of the path, the remote
end can be reconstructed as well. The paths become asymmetric at the
seventh router when working in this direction. <a href="ch04_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-4-FIG-2">Figure 4-2</a> shows the first four hops. We could probably
fill in the remaining addresses for each direction by running
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> to the specific machine where the
route breaks down, but this probably isn't worth the effort.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-4-FIG-2" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="325" alt="Figure 4-2" src="figs/ntt_0402.gif" width="186" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-2. First four hops on reverse path</h4>

<a name="INDEX-703" /></a><a name="INDEX-704" /></a><a name="INDEX-705" /></a><a name="INDEX-706" /></a>One possible surprise in <a href="ch04_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-4-FIG-2">Figure 4-2</a> is that we have the same IP number,
<em class="filename">205.160.97.41</em>, on each interface at the first
hop. The explanation is that dial-in access is being used. The IP
number <em class="filename">205.166.97.122</em> is assigned to the host
when the connection is made. <em class="filename">205.160.97.41</em> must
be the access router. This numbering scheme is normal for an access
router.
</p><p>

Although we haven't constructed a complete picture of the
path(s) between these two computers, we have laid out the basic
connection to our network through our ISP. This is worth working out
well in advance of any problems. When you suspect problems, you can
easily ping these intermediate routers to pinpoint the exact location
of a problem. This will tell you whether it is your problem or your
ISP's problem. This can also be nice information to have when
you call your ISP.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-707" /></a><a name="INDEX-708" /></a><a name="INDEX-709" /></a>To construct the bidirectional path using
the technique just described, you need access to a second, remote
computer on the Internet from which you can run
<em class="filename">traceroute</em>. Fortunately, this is not a problem.
There are a number of sites on the Internet, which, as a service to
the network community, will run <em class="filename">traceroute</em> for
you. Often called <em class="emphasis">looking glasses</em>, such sites
can provide a number of other services as well. For example, you may
be able to test how accessible your local DNS setup is by observing
how well <em class="filename">traceroute</em> works. A list of such sites
can be found at <a href="http://www.traceroute.org/">http://www.traceroute.org</a>. Alternately, the search string "web
traceroute" or "traceroute looking glass" will
usually turn up a number of such sites with most search engines.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-710" /></a><a name="INDEX-711" /></a><a name="INDEX-712" /></a>In theory, there is an alternative way
to find this type of information with some implementations of
<em class="filename">traceroute</em>. Some versions of
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> support <em class="emphasis">loose source
routing</em>, the ability to specify one or more intermediate
hops that the packets must go through. This allows a packet to be
diverted through a specific router on its way to its destination.
(<em class="emphasis">Strict source routing</em> may also be available.
This allows the user to specify an exact path through a network.
While loose source routing can take any path that includes the
specified hops, strict source routing must exactly follow the given
path.)
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-713" /></a><a name="INDEX-714" /></a><a name="INDEX-715" /></a>To construct a detailed list
of all devices on a path, the approach is to use
<em class="filename">traceroute</em> to find a path from the source host
to itself, specifying a route through a remote device. Packets leave
the host with the remote device as their initial destination. When
the packets arrive at the remote device, that device replaces the
destination address with the source's address, and the packets
are redirected back to the source. Thus, you get a picture of the
path both coming and going. (Of course, source routing is not limited
to just this combination of addresses.)
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-716" /></a>At least, that is how it should
work in theory. In practice, many devices no longer support source
routing. Unfortunately, source routing has been used in IP spoofing
attacks. Packets sent with a spoofed source address can be diverted
so they pass through the spoofed device's network. This
approach will sometimes slip packets past firewalls since the packet

This is shown in <a href="ch04_01.html#nettroubletools-CHP-4-FIG-3">Figure 4-3</a>. Without source
routing, the packet would come into the firewall on the wrong
interface and be discarded. With source routing, the packet arrives
on the correct interface and passes through the firewall. Because of
problems like this, source routing is frequently disabled.

One final word of warning regarding
<em class="filename">traceroute -- </em>buggy or nonstandard
implementations exist. Nonstandard isn't necessarily bad; it
just means you need to watch for differences. For example, see the
