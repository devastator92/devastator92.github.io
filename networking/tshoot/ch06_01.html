<a name="INDEX-1288" /></a><a name="INDEX-1289" /></a><a name="INDEX-1290" /></a><a name="INDEX-1291" /></a>The earlier
chapters in this book focused on collecting information on the
smaller parts of a network, such as the configuration of an
individual computer or the path between a pair of computers. Starting
with this chapter, we will broaden our approach and look at tools
more suited to collecting information on IP networks as a whole. The
next three closely related chapters deal with managing and
troubleshooting devices distributed throughout a network. This
chapter focuses on device discovery and mapping. Additional
techniques and tools for this purpose are presented in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Device Monitoring with SNMP"</a>, once <em class="emphasis">Simple Network Management
Protocol</em> (SNMP) has been introduced. <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Performance Measurement Tools"</a> focuses on the collection of information on
traffic patterns and device utilization throughout the network.
</p><p>

This chapter begins with a brief discussion of the relationship
between network management and troubleshooting. This is followed by a
discussion of ways to map out the IP addresses that are being used on
your network and ways to find which IP addresses correspond to which
hosts. This is followed by a description of ways to discover more
information on these hosts based on the network services they support
and other forensic information. The chapter briefly discusses
scripting tools, then describes the network mapping and monitoring
tool, <em class="filename">tkined</em>. The chapter concludes with a brief
description of related tools for use with Microsoft Windows
platforms.

<h2 class="sect1">6.1. Troubleshooting Versus Management</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1292" /></a><a name="INDEX-1293" /></a>Some of the tools in the next few
chapters may seem only marginally related to troubleshooting. This is
not a totally unfair judgment. Of course, troubleshooting is an
unpredictable business, and any tools that can provide information
may be useful in some circumstances. Often you will want to use tools
that were designed with another purpose in mind.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1294" /></a>But these tools were
not included just on the off chance they might be useful. Many of the
tools described here, while typically used for management, are just
as useful for troubleshooting. In a very real sense, troubleshooting
and management are just different sides of the same coin. Ideally,
management deals with problems before they happen, while
troubleshooting deals with problems after the fact. With this in
mind, it is worth reviewing management software with an eye on how it
can be used as troubleshooting software.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-6-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.1. Characteristics of Management Software</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1295" /></a><a name="INDEX-1296" /></a>Everyone seems to have
a different idea of exactly what management software should do.
Ideally, network management software will provide the following:
</p><p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Discovery and mapping</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1297" /></a><a name="INDEX-1298" /></a>Discovery includes
both the automatic detection of all devices on a network and the
collection of basic information about each device, such as the type
of each device, its MAC address and IP address, the type of software
being used, and, possibly, the services it provides. Mapping is the
creation of a graphical representation of the network showing
individual interconnections as well as overall topology.
</p><p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Event monitoring</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1299" /></a>Once a picture of the network has been
created, each device may be monitored to ensure continuous operation.
This can be done passively, by waiting for the device to send an
update or alert, or by actively polling the device.
</p><p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Remote configuration</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1300" /></a><a name="INDEX-1301" /></a>You should be able to connect to each
device and then examine and change its configuration. It should also
be possible to collectively track configuration information, such as
which IP addresses are in use.
</p><p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Metering and performance management</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1302" /></a><a name="INDEX-1303" /></a><a name="INDEX-1304" /></a><a name="INDEX-1305" /></a><a name="INDEX-1306" /></a>Information on resource
utilization should be collected. Ideally, this information should be
available in a usable form for purposes such as trend analysis and
capacity planning.
</p><p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Software management</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1307" /></a><a name="INDEX-1308" /></a><a name="INDEX-1309" /></a>Being able to install and
configure software remotely is rapidly becoming a necessity in larger
organizations. Being able to track licensing can be essential to
avoid legal problems. Version management is also important.
</p><p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Security and accounting</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-1310" /></a><a name="INDEX-1311" /></a>Depending on the sensitivity of data,
the organization's business model, and access and billing
policies, it may be necessary to control or track who is using what
on the network.
</p><p>
</dd>

</dl>

It doesn't take much imagination to see how most of these
functions relate to troubleshooting. This chapter focuses on
discovery and mapping. <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Device Monitoring with SNMP"</a> will discuss
event monitoring and the remote configuration of hardware and
software. Metering and performance management are discussed in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Performance Measurement Tools"</a>. Security is discussed throughout the next
three chapters as appropriate.

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-6-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.2. Discovery and Mapping Tools</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1312" /></a><a name="INDEX-1313" /></a><a name="INDEX-1314" /></a><a name="INDEX-1315" /></a><a name="INDEX-1316" /></a>A wide range of tools is available. At the
low end are <em class="emphasis">point tools --</em> tools designed to
deal with specific tasks or closely related tasks. Several of the
tools we will examine, such as <em class="filename">arpwatch</em> and
<em class="filename">nmap</em>, fall in this category. Such tools tend to
be well focused and do their job well. Typically, they are very easy
to learn to use and are usually free or quite inexpensive.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1317" /></a><a name="INDEX-1318" /></a>Also found
at the low end are toolkits and scripting languages for creating your
own applications. Unlike most prebuilt tools, these can be extremely
difficult to both learn and use, but they often give you the greatest
degree of control. The quality of the final tool will ultimately
depend on how much effort and skill you put into its creation. The
initial outlay may be modest, but the development time can be
extremely costly. Nonetheless, some people swear by this approach.
The idea is that time is spent once to develop a tool that saves time
each time it is used. We will look very briefly at the scripting
language <em class="emphasis">Tcl</em> and its extensions. The primary
goal here will be to describe the issues and provide information on
how to get started.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1319" /></a>At the middle of the range are integrated
packages. This type of software addresses more than one aspect of
network management. They typically include network discovery,
mapping, and monitoring programs but may include other functionality
as well. Typically they are straightforward to use but don't
perform well with very large, diverse networks.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1320" /></a>Finally, at the high end are
frameworks. Roughly, these are packages that can be easily extended.
Since you can extend functionality by adding modules, frameworks are
better suited for larger, diverse networks. But be warned, dividing
lines among these last categories are not finely drawn.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1321" /></a><a name="INDEX-1322" /></a><a name="INDEX-1323" /></a><a name="INDEX-1324" /></a><a name="INDEX-1325" /></a><a name="INDEX-1326" /></a><a name="INDEX-1327" /></a><a name="INDEX-1328" /></a>Unfortunately, at the time of
this writing, there aren't many freely available packages at
these higher levels. The leading contenders are really works in
progress. <em class="filename">tkined</em> is described in this chapter
and the next because it seemed, at the time this was written, to be
further along and fairly stable. But there are at least two other
projects making rapid progress in this area that are worth
considering. The work of Open Network Management Systems (<a href="http://www.opennms.org/">http://www.opennms.org</a>) is truly outstanding
and making terrific progress. The other is the <em class="filename">GxSNMP SNMP
Manager</em> (<a href="http://www.gxsnmp.org/">http://www.gxsnmp.org</a>), a part of the GNOME
project. Both are open source (<a href="http://opensource.org/">http://opensource.org</a>) projects, and both
appear to have a committed base of supporters and are likely to be
successful. At the time this was written, both had begun to release
viable tools, particularly the Open Network Management Systems folks.
(Linux users may want to also consider <em class="filename">Cheops</em>.)

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-6-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.3. Selecting a Product</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1329" /></a><a name="INDEX-1330" /></a><a name="INDEX-1331" /></a>It may seem strange that a book
devoted to noncommercial software would recommend buying software,
but network management is one area in which you should at least
consider the possibility. Commercial products are not without
problems, but noncommercial mapping and management tools are
relatively scarce. Depending on the size of the network you are
dealing with, you may have little choice but to consider commercial
products at this time.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1332" /></a>The key factors are the size of your
network, the size of your budget, and the cost of a nonfunctioning
network. With point tools, you will be forced to put the pieces
together. Certainly, this is something you can do with a small
network. If you are responsible for a single LAN or small number of
LANs and if you can tolerate being down for a few hours at a time,
then you can probably survive with the noncommercial tools described
here. But if you are responsible for a larger network or one that is
rapidly changing, then you should consider commercial tools. While
these may be quite expensive, they may be essential for a large
network. And if you are really dealing with a large number of
machines, the cost per machine may not be that high.
</p><p>

Even if you feel compelled to buy commercial management software, you
should read the rest of this chapter. Several of the point tools
described here can be used in conjunction with commercial tools. Some
of these tools, because they are designed for a single function, will
perform better than commercial tools that attempt to do everything.
In a few instances, noncommercial tools address issues not addressed
by commercial tools.<a name="INDEX-1333" /></a><a name="INDEX-1334" /></a>
