<a name="INDEX-5" /></a><a name="INDEX-6" /></a><a name="INDEX-7" /></a><a name="INDEX-8" /></a>The first step in diagnosing a
network problem is to collect information. This includes collecting
information from your users as to the nature of the problems they are
having, and it includes collecting data from your network. Your
success will depend, in large part, on your efficiency in collecting
this information and on the quality of the information you collect.
This book is about tools you can use and techniques and strategies to
optimize their use. Rather than trying to cover all aspects of
troubleshooting, this book focuses on this first crucial step, data
collection.
</p><p>

There is an extraordinary variety of tools available for this
purpose, and more become available daily. Very capable people are
selflessly devoting enormous amounts of time and effort to developing
these tools. We all owe a tremendous debt to these individuals. But
with the variety of tools available, it is easy to be overwhelmed.
Fortunately, while the number of tools is large, data collection need
not be overwhelming. A small number of tools can be used to solve
most problems. This book centers on a core set of freely available
tools, with pointers to additional tools that might be needed in some
circumstances.
</p><p>

This first chapter has two goals. Although general troubleshooting is
not the focus of the book, it seems worthwhile to quickly review
troubleshooting techniques. This review is followed by an examination
of troubleshooting from a broader administrative context -- using
troubleshooting tools in an effective, productive, and responsible
manner. This part of the chapter includes a discussion of
documentation practices, personnel management and professionalism,
legal and ethical concerns, and economic considerations. General
troubleshooting is revisited in <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Troubleshooting Strategies"</a>, once we
have discussed available tools. If you are already familiar with
these topics, you may want to skim or even skip this chapter.
</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="nettroubletools-CHP-1-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">1.1. General Approaches to Troubleshooting</h2>

<a name="INDEX-9" /></a>Troubleshooting is a complex process
that is best learned through experience. This section looks briefly
at how troubleshooting is done in order to see how these tools fit
into the process. But while every problem is different, a key step is
collecting information.
</p><p>

Clearly, the best way to approach troubleshooting is to avoid it. If
you never have problems, you will have nothing to correct. Sound
engineering practices, redundancy, documentation, and training can
help. But regardless of how well engineered your system is, things
break. You can avoid troubleshooting, but you can't escape it.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-10" /></a><a name="INDEX-11" /></a>It may seem unnecessary to say, but go for
the quick fixes first. As long as you don't fixate on them,
they won't take long. Often the first thing to try is resetting
the system. Many problems can be resolved in this way. Bit rot,
cosmic rays, or the alignment of the planets may result in the system
entering some strange state from which it can't exit. If the
problem really is a fluke, resetting the system may resolve the
problem, and you may never see it again. This may not seem very
satisfying, but you can take your satisfaction in going home on time
instead.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-12" /></a><a name="INDEX-13" /></a><a name="INDEX-14" /></a>Keep in mind
that there are several different levels in resetting a system. For
software, you can simply restart the program, or you may be able to
send a signal to the program so that it reloads its initialization
file. From your users' perspective, this is the least
disruptive approach. Alternately, you might restart the operating
system but without cycling the power, i.e., do a <em class="emphasis">warm
reboot</em>. Finally, you might try a <em class="emphasis">cold
reboot</em> by cycling the power.
</p><p>

You should be aware, however, that there can be some dangers in
resetting a system. For example, it is possible to inadvertently make
changes to a system so that it can't reboot. If you realize you
have done this in time, you can correct the problem. Once you have
shut down the system, it may be too late. If you don't have a
backup boot disk, you will have to rebuild the system. These are,
fortunately, rare circumstances and usually happen only when you have
been making major changes to a system.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-15" /></a>When
making changes to a system, remember that scheduled maintenance may
involve restarting a system. You may want to test changes you have
made, including their impact on a system reset, prior to such
maintenance to ensure that there are no problems. Otherwise, the
system may fail when restarted during the scheduled maintenance. If
this happens, you will be faced with the difficult task of deciding
which of several different changes are causing problems.
</p><p>

Resetting the system is certainly worth trying once. Doing it more
than once is a different matter. With some systems, this becomes a
way of life. An operating system that doesn't provide adequate
memory protection will frequently become wedged so that rebooting is
the only option.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> Sometimes you may
want to limp along resetting the system occasionally rather than
dealing with the problem. In a university setting, this might get you
through exam week to a time when you can be more relaxed in your
efforts to correct the underlying problem. Or, if the system is to be
replaced in the near future, the effort may not be justified.
Usually, however, when rebooting becomes a way of life, it is time
for more decisive action.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /></a>[1]Do you know what operating system
I'm tactfully not naming?</p><p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-16" /></a><a name="INDEX-17" /></a><a name="INDEX-18" /></a><a name="INDEX-19" /></a><a name="INDEX-20" /></a>Swapping
components and reinstalling software is often the next thing to try.
If you have the spare components, this can often resolve problems
immediately. Even if you don't have spares, switching
components to see if the problem follows the equipment can be a
simple first test. Reinstalling software can be much more
problematic. This can often result in configuration errors that will
worsen problems. The old, installed version of the software can make
getting a new, clean installation impossible. But if the install is
simple or you have a clear understanding of exactly how to configure
the software, this can be a relatively quick fix.
</p><p>

While these approaches often work, they aren't what we usually
think of as troubleshooting. You certainly don't need the tools
described in this book to do them. Once you have exhausted the quick
solutions, it is time to get serious. First, you must understand the
problem, if possible. Problems that are not understood are usually
not fixed, just postponed.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-21" /></a><a name="INDEX-22" /></a>One standard admonition is to ask the
question "has anything changed recently?" Overwhelmingly,
most problems relate to changes to a working system. If you can
temporarily change things back and the problem goes away, you have
confirmed your diagnosis.
</p><p>

Admittedly, this may not help with an installation where everything
is new. But even a new installation can and should be grown. Pieces
can be installed and tested. New pieces of equipment can then be
added incrementally. When this approach is taken, the question of
what has changed once again makes sense.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-23" /></a><a name="INDEX-24" /></a>Another admonition is to change only
one thing at a time and then to test thoroughly after each change.
This is certainly good advice when dealing with routine failures. But
this approach will not apply if you are dealing with a system
failure. (See the upcoming sidebar on system failures.) Also, if you
do find something that you know is wrong but fixing it doesn't
fix your problem, do you really want to change it back? In this case,
it is often better to make a note of the additional changes you have
made and then proceed with your troubleshooting.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-25" /></a><a name="INDEX-26" /></a><a name="INDEX-27" /></a><a name="INDEX-28" /></a><a name="INDEX-29" /></a>A
key element to successful debugging is to control the focus of your
investigation so that you are really dealing with the problem. You
can usually focus better if you can break the problem into pieces.
Swapping components, as mentioned previously, is an example of this
approach. This technique is known by several names -- problem
decomposition, divide and conquer, binary search, and so on. This
approach is applicable to all kinds of troubleshooting. For example,
when your car won't start, first decide whether you have an
electrical or fuel supply problem. Then proceed accordingly. <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Troubleshooting Strategies"</a> outlines a series of specific steps you might
want to consider.
</p><p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-1-SIDEBAR-1" /></a><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">System Failures</h4>

<a name="INDEX-30" /></a><a name="INDEX-31" /></a><a name="INDEX-32" /></a>The troubleshooting I have described so
far can be seen roughly as dealing with <em class="emphasis">normal</em>
<em class="emphasis">failures</em> (although there may be nothing terribly
normal about them). A second general class of problems is known as
<em class="emphasis">system failures</em>. System failures are problems
that stem from the interaction of the parts of a complex system in
unexpected ways. They are most often seen when two or more subsystems
fail at about the same time and in ways that interact. However,
system failures can result through interaction of subsystems without
any ostensible failure in any of the subsystems.
</p><p>

A classic example of a system failure can be seen in the movie
<em class="emphasis">China Syndrome</em>. In one scene the reactor scrams,
the pumps shut down, and the water-level indicator on a strip-chart
recorder sticks. The water level in the reactor becomes dangerously
low due to the pump shutdown, but the problem is not recognized
because the indicator gives misleading information. These two
near-simultaneous failures conceal the true state of the reactor.
</p><p>

System failures are most pernicious in systems with tight coupling
between subsystems and subsystems that are linked in nonlinear or
nonobvious ways. Debugging a system failure can be extremely
difficult. Many of the more standard approaches simply don't
work. The strategy of decomposing the system into subsystems becomes
difficult, because the symptoms misdirect your efforts. Moreover, in
extreme cases, each subsystem may be operating correctly -- the
problem stems entirely from the unexpected interactions.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-33" /></a><a name="INDEX-34" /></a><a name="INDEX-35" /></a><a name="INDEX-36" /></a><a name="INDEX-37" /></a>If you suspect you have a system
failure, the best approach, when feasible, is to substitute entire
subsystems. Your goal should not be to look for a restored
functioning system, but to look for <em class="emphasis">changes</em> in
the symptoms. Such changes indicate that you may have found one of
the subsystems involved. (Conversely, if you are working with a
problem and the symptoms change when a subsystem is replaced, this is
strong indication of a system failure.)
</p><p>

Unfortunately, if the problem stems from unexpected interaction of
nonfailing systems, even this approach will not work. These are
extremely difficult problems to diagnose. Each problem must be
treated as a unique, special problem. But again, an important first
step is collecting information.
