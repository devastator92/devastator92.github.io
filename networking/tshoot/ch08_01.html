<a name="INDEX-1936" /></a>Everything on your network may be
working, but using it can still be a frustrating experience. Often, a
poorly performing system is worse than a broken system. As a user on
a broken system, you know when to give up and find something else to
do. And as an administrator, it is usually much easier to identify a
component that isn't working at all than one that is still
working but performing poorly. In this chapter, we will look at tools
and techniques used to evaluate network performance.
</p><p>

This chapter begins with a brief overview of the types of tools
available. Then we look at <em class="filename">ntop</em>, an excellent
tool for watching traffic on your local network. Next, I describe
<em class="filename">mrtg</em>, <em class="filename">rrd</em>, and
<em class="filename">cricket</em> -- tools for collecting traffic data
from remote devices over time. RMON, monitoring extensions to SNMP,
is next. We conclude with tools for use on Microsoft Windows systems.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1937" /></a>Don't
overlook the obvious! Although we will look at tools for measuring
traffic, user dissatisfaction is probably the best single indicator
of the health of your network. If users are satisfied, you
needn't worry about theoretical problems. And if users are
screaming at your door, then it doesn't matter what the numbers
prove.

<h2 class="sect1">8.1. What, When, and Where</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1938" /></a>Network performance will depend on
many things -- on the applications you are using and how they are
configured, on the hosts running these applications, on the
networking devices, on the structure and design of the network as a
whole, and on how these pieces interact with one another. Even though
the focus of this chapter is restricted to network performance, you
shouldn't ignore the other pieces of the puzzle. Problems may
arise from the interaction of these pieces, or a problem with one of
the pieces may look like a problem with another piece. A
misconfigured or poorly designed application can significantly
increase the amount of traffic on a network. For example, Version 1.1
of the HTTP protocol provides for persistent connections that can
significantly reduce traffic. Not using this particular feature is
unlikely to be a make or break issue. My point is, if you look only
at the traffic on a network without considering software
configurations, you may seem to have a hardware capacity problem when
a simple change in software might lessen the problem and, at a
minimum, buy you a little more time.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1939" /></a><a name="INDEX-1940" /></a><a name="INDEX-1941" /></a><a name="INDEX-1942" /></a>This chapter will focus on tools
used to collect information on network performance. The first step in
analyzing performance is measuring traffic. In addition to problem
identification and resolution, this should be done as part of
capacity planning and capacity management (tuning). Several books
listed in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Resources and References"</a> provide general discussions of
application and host performance analysis.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1943" /></a>Of the issues related to measuring
network traffic, the most important ones are what to measure, how
often, and where. Although there are no simple answers to any of
these questions, what to measure is probably the hardest of the
three. It is extremely easy to end up with so much data that you
don't have time to analyze it. Or you may collect data that
doesn't match your needs or that is in an unusable format. If
you keep at it, eventually you will learn from experience what is
most useful. Take the time to think about how you will use the data
before you begin. Be as goal directed as possible. Just realize that,
even with the most careful planning, when faced with a new, unusual
problem, you'll probably think of something you wish you had
been measuring.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1944" /></a>If you are looking at the performance of
your system over time, then data at just one point in time will be of
little value. You will need to collect data periodically. How often
you collect will depend on the granularity or frequency of the events
you want to watch. For many tasks, the ideal approach is one that
periodically condenses and eventually discards older data.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1945" /></a><a name="INDEX-1946" /></a><a name="INDEX-1947" /></a>Unless your network is really
unusual, the level of usage will vary with the time of day, the day
of the week, and the time of the year. Most performance related
problems will be most severe at the busiest times. In telephony, the
hour when traffic is heaviest is known as the <em class="emphasis">busy
hour</em>, and planning centers around traffic at this time. In
a data network, for example, the busy hour may be first thing in the
morning when everyone is logging on and checking their email, or it
could be at noon when everyone is web surfing over their lunch hour.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1948" /></a><a name="INDEX-1949" /></a>Knowing usage patterns can simplify
data collection since you'll need to do little collecting when
the network is underutilized. Changes in usage patterns can indicate
fundamental changes in your network that you'll want to be able
to identify and explain. Finally, knowing when your network is least
busy should give you an idea of the most convenient times to do
maintenance.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1950" /></a><a name="INDEX-1951" /></a><a name="INDEX-1952" /></a><a name="INDEX-1953" /></a><a name="INDEX-1954" /></a><a name="INDEX-1955" /></a><a name="INDEX-1956" /></a><a name="INDEX-1957" /></a><a name="INDEX-1958" /></a>I have divided traffic-measurement tools
into three rough categories based on where they are used within a
network. Tools that allow you to capture traffic coming into or going
out of a particular machine are called
<em class="emphasis">host-monitoring</em> tools. Tools that place an
interface in promiscuous mode and allow you to capture all the
traffic at an interface are called
<em class="emphasis">point-monitoring</em> tools. Finally, tools that
build a global picture of network traffic by querying other hosts
(which are in turn running either host-monitoring or point-monitoring
tools) are called <em class="emphasis">network-monitoring</em> tools. Both
host monitoring and point monitoring should have a minimal impact on
network traffic. With the exception of DNS traffic, they
shouldn't be generating additional traffic. This is not true
for network-monitoring tools.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1959" /></a><a name="INDEX-1960" /></a>Because of their roles within a
network, devices such as switches and routers don't easily fit
into this classification scheme. If a single switch interconnects all
devices in a subnet, then it will see all the local traffic. If,
however, multiple switches are used and you aren't mirroring
traffic, each switch will see only part of the traffic. Routers will
see only traffic moving between networks. While this is ideal for
measuring traffic between local and remote devices, it is not helpful
in understanding strictly local traffic. The problem should be
obvious. If you monitor the wrong device, you may easily miss
bottlenecks or other problems. Before collecting data, you need to
understand the structure of your network so you can understand what
traffic is actually being seen. This is one reason the information in
<a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Device Discovery and Mapping"</a>, is important.
</p><p>

Finally, you certainly won't want to deal with raw data on a
routine basis. You will want tools that present the data in a useful
manner. For time-series data, graphs and summary statistics are
usually the best choice.<a name="INDEX-1961" /></a>
