<h2 class="sect1">6.6. Politics and Security</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1563" /><a name="INDEX-1564" /><a name="INDEX-1565" /><a name="INDEX-1566" /><a name="INDEX-1567" />You should have a legitimate reason and
the authority to use the tools described here. Some of these tools
directly probe other computers on the network. Even legitimate uses
of these tools can create surprises for users and may, in some
instances, result in considerable ill will and mistrust. For example,
doing security probes to discover weaknesses in your network may be a
perfectly reasonable thing to do, provided that is your
responsibility. But you don't want these scans to come as a
surprise to your users. I, for one, strongly resent unexpected
probing of my computer regardless of the reason. Often, a
well-meaning individual has scanned a network only to find himself
with a lot of explaining to do. The list of people who have made this
mistake includes several big names in the security community.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1568" /><a name="INDEX-1569" />With the rise of personal firewalls
and monitoring tools, more and more users are monitoring what is
happening on their local networks and at their computers. Not all of
these users really understand the results returned by these tools, so
you should be prepared to deal with misunderstandings. Reactions can
be extreme, even from people who should know enough to put things in
context.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1570" /><a name="INDEX-1571" /><a name="INDEX-1572" /><a name="INDEX-1573" /><a name="INDEX-1574" />The
first time I used <em class="filename">CiscoWorks</em> for Windows, the
program scanned the network with, among others, CMIP packets. This,
of course, is a perfectly natural thing to do. Unfortunately, another
machine on the network had been configured in a manner that, when it
saw the packet, it began blocking all subsequent packets from the
management station. It then began logging all subsequent traffic from
the management station as attacks. This included the System Messaged
Blocks (SMB) that are a normal part of the network background noise
created by computers running Microsoft Windows. A couple of days
later I received a very concerned email regarding a 10-page log of
attacks originating from the management station. To make matters
worse, the clock on the "attacked" computer was off a
couple of hours. The times recorded for the alleged attacks
didn't fall in the block of time I had run
<em class="filename">CiscoWorks</em>. It did include, however, blocks of
times I knew the management station was offline. Before it was all
sorted out, my overactive imagination had turned it into a malicious
attack with a goal of casting blame on the management station when it
was nothing more than a misunderstanding.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-29">[29]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-29" />[29]This
problem could have been lessened if both had been running NTP. NTP is
discussed in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Miscellaneous Tools"</a>.</p> </blockquote>

It is best to deal with such potential problems in advance by clearly
stating what you will be doing and why. If you can't justify
it, then perhaps you should reconsider exactly why you are doing it.
A number of sites automatically block networks or hosts they receive
scans from. And within some organizations, unauthorized scanning may
be grounds for dismissal. You should consider developing a formal
policy clearly stating when and by whom scanning may and may not be
done.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1575" /><a name="INDEX-1576" /><a name="INDEX-1577" /><a name="INDEX-1578" /><a name="INDEX-1579" />This leads to an important point: you
really should have a thorough understanding of how scanning tools
work before you use them. For example, some SNMP tools have you enter
a list of the various SNMP passwords (community strings) you use on
your network. In the automatic discovery mode, it will probe for SNMP
devices by trying each of these passwords in turn on each machine on
the network. This is intended to save the network manager from having
to enter this information for each individual device. However, it is
a simple matter for scanned machines to capture these passwords.
Tools like <em class="filename">dsniff</em> are designed specifically for
that purpose. I strongly recommend watching the behavior of whatever
scanning tools you use with a tool like <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>
or <em class="filename">ethereal</em> to see what it is actually doing.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1580" />Unfortunately, some of the
developers of these tools can't seem to decide whether they are
writing for responsible users or crackers. As previously noted, some
tools include questionable features, such as support stealth scans or
forged IP addresses. In general, I have described only those features
for which I can see a legitimate use. However, sometimes there is no
clear dividing line. For example, forged IP addresses can be useful
in testing firewalls. When I have described such features, I assume
that you will be able to distinguish between appropriate and
inappropriate uses.
