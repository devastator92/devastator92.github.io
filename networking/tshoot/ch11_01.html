This chapter contains odds and ends that don't really fit any
of the categories described in previous chapters. Most of the
software presented here isn't really designed with network
troubleshooting in mind, but it is, nonetheless, quite useful. These
are tools that will make your life easier. With a few notable
exceptions, you should already be familiar with most of the tools
described here. Consequently, the descriptions of the tools are, for
the most part, fairly brief. Feel free to jump around in this chapter
as needed.

remote systems, you will need to log on remotely. Even with small
networks, it isn't reasonable to jump up and run to the remote
system every time you need to do this. This section has three
subsections. First, a quick review of techniques you can use to
record or log your activities when using familiar tools like
<em class="filename">telnet</em>, <em class="filename">rlogin</em>, and X
Windows. Next comes a discussion of <em class="filename">vnc</em>, a tool
that allows you to view a computer's graphical display
remotely. Then I briefly discuss security concerns for these tools
including a short description of <em class="filename">ssh</em>.

<h3 class="sect2">11.1.1. Automating Documentation</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2639" /></a><a name="INDEX-2640" /></a><a name="INDEX-2641" /></a>This book has assumed
that you are familiar with tools like <em class="filename">telnet</em>,
<em class="filename">rlogin</em>, and X Windows. To use these tools
effectively, you'll want to be able to record or log your
activities from time to time. Arguably, one reason documentation is
so often flawed is that it is usually written after the fact. This is
often done from memory or an incomplete set of notes several days
after changes have been made. While the best time to write
documentation is as you go, often this simply isn't possible.
When your network is down and management is calling every five
minutes asking if it's fixed yet, you probably won't be
pausing to write much down.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2642" /></a><a name="INDEX-2643" /></a><a name="INDEX-2644" /></a>There are a few things you can do to
help simplify writing documentation after the fact. First, get
copious printouts at every stage, preferably with some kind of time
and date stamp. When a production system is down, it is not the time
to worry about the cost of paper. Several commands you are probably
already familiar with may be easy to overlook with the stress of
dealing with a dead system.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2645" /></a><a name="INDEX-2646" /></a><a name="INDEX-2647" /></a><a name="INDEX-2648" /></a><a name="INDEX-2649" /></a><a name="INDEX-2650" /></a>If you are using X Windows, you can use
the <em class="filename">xwd</em> command to capture windows. To use this
command, in an <em class="filename">xterm</em> window, type:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# xwd -out xwdfile</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2651" /></a><a name="INDEX-2652" /></a><a name="INDEX-2653" /></a>You can then click on the window you want
to capture. In this example, the file <em class="filename">xwdfile</em>
will be created in the current directory. The file can be examined
later or printed using tools such as <em class="filename">xv</em> or
<em class="filename">gimp</em>. Be sure to give these files meaningful
names so that you can sort things out later.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2654" /></a><a name="INDEX-2655" /></a><a name="INDEX-2656" /></a>If you are using a text-based interface
and are interested in capturing the output of a single command, you
may be able to use the <em class="filename">tee</em> command. This command
allows you to send output from a command to both the screen and a
file. For example, the following command will display the output of
the command <tt class="literal">arp -a</tt> on the screen and write it to
the file <em class="filename">outfile</em>:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# arp -a | tee outfile</pre></blockquote>

The <em class="filename">tee</em> command may require special measures to
work. For example, you must use the option <em class="filename">-l</em>
with <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> if you want to use
<em class="filename">tee</em>. An example was given in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Packet Capture"</a>. As with <em class="filename">xwd</em>, you should
be careful to use meaningful filenames, particularly if you are
capturing windows on the fly.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2657" /></a><a name="INDEX-2658" /></a><a name="INDEX-2659" /></a>An alternative to
<em class="filename">tee</em> is <em class="filename">script</em>. It can be
used to capture the output of a single command or a series of
commands. To capture a series of commands, you start
<em class="filename">script</em> and then issue the commands of interest.
For example, the following command will create the file
<em class="filename">scriptfile</em> and return to the system prompt:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# script scriptfile
Script started, output file is scriptfile</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-2660" /></a>Everything that is
displayed on your terminal will be logged to the file
<em class="filename">scriptfile</em>. One advantage of logging a series of
commands is that you can embed documentation into the file as you go.
Simply type the comment character for your shell, and everything else
you type on the line will be ignored. For example, with the Bourne
shell, you might type something like:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# #Well, the foo program didn't work.  \
&gt;Let's try the bar program.</pre></blockquote>

The "\" character was used to continue the comment on a
new line.
</p><p>

When you are done logging a session, type <tt class="literal">exit</tt> or
press Ctrl+D as in:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# exit

Script done, output file is scriptfile</pre></blockquote>

You can now print or edit the file as desired.</p><p>

One option that is often overlooked is to include a command with the
<em class="filename">script </em>command. For example:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# script scriptfile ifconfig -a</pre></blockquote>

will run the program <em class="filename">ifconfig -a,</em> writing the
output to the file <em class="filename">scriptfile</em> and displaying the
output on the screen as well. This file will include two time and
date stamps, one at the beginning and one at the end of the file.
</p><p>

You should be aware of a few problems with using
<em class="filename">script</em>. First, the file can get very big very
quickly. This shouldn't be much of a problem unless you are
pressed for disk space, but it can be painful to read after the fact.
Second, it is all too easy to lose the file. For example, if a system
crashes or is halted, the file may be lost in the process. Third,
commands that directly control the screen such as
<em class="filename">vi</em> tend to fill the output file with garbage.
Finally, since a new shell is started by <em class="filename">script</em>,
environmental changes made while <em class="filename">script</em> is
running may be lost.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2661" /></a><a name="INDEX-2662" /></a><a name="INDEX-2663" /></a>If you are connecting to a remote
system using a variant of <em class="filename">telnet</em>, you may be
able to log the session or print the screen. This is particularly
true for PC implementations of <em class="filename">telnet</em>. See the
documentation for the version you are using.

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-11-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.2. vnc</h3>

<em class="filename">vnc</em><a name="INDEX-2664" /></a><a name="INDEX-2665" /></a><a name="INDEX-2666" /></a><a name="INDEX-2667" /></a>, short for <em class="emphasis">virtual network
computing</em>, was developed by what is now the AT&amp;T
Laboratories at Cambridge. <em class="filename">vnc</em> is actually a
pair of programs. One is a server<em class="emphasis">,</em> which
generates and sends the local display's contents to another
computer. The other is a viewer, which reconstructs the
server's display. You use the computer running the viewer
program to control the remote computer running the server program. An
application, for example, would actually be running on the
server's CPU but controlled by the station running the viewer.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2668" /></a><a name="INDEX-2669" /></a><a name="INDEX-2670" /></a>The program's implementation is
based on the concept of a <em class="emphasis">remote frame buffer</em>
(i.e., remote video display memory). The server maintains the frame
buffer, a picture of the server's display, and sends it to the
viewer. The viewer recreates the display on the local host. The
updates to the remote frame buffer may be the complete contents of
the frame buffer or, to minimize the impact on bandwidth, just what
has changed since the last update.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2671" /></a><a name="INDEX-2672" /></a><a name="INDEX-2673" /></a>In a Unix environment,
<em class="filename">vnc</em> provides a way to deliver an X Windows
session to a host that may not support a native X Windows connection.
On the surface, a <em class="filename">vnc</em> connection probably seems
a lot like an X Windows connection. There are, however, some
fundamental differences. <em class="filename">vnc</em> is designed so the
viewer is a very thin client. Unlike an X Windows, almost no work is
done at the viewer, and the client software is stateless. And
<em class="filename">vnc</em> is freely available on some non-Unix systems
where X Window isn't.
</p><p>

<em class="filename">vnc</em><a name="INDEX-2674" /></a> can run in one of two modes. In
<em class="emphasis">view only mode</em>, the screen is displayed, but the
viewer is not given control of the server's mouse or keyboard.
If view only mode is not selected, the viewer will share control of
the mouse and keyboard. Please note, the mouse and keyboard will not
necessarily be disabled at the server.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2675" /></a>To use <em class="filename">vnc</em> in a
Unix environment, <em class="filename">telnet</em> to the remote computer
and start the <em class="filename">vnc</em> server with the
<em class="filename">vncserver</em> command. The first time you run it, it
will create a <em class="filename">.vnc</em> directory under your home
directory and will query you for a connection password that will be
used for all future sessions. (You can change this with the
<em class="filename">vncpasswd</em> command.)
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">lnx1$ vncserver

You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password:
Verify:

New 'X' desktop is lnx1.lander.edu:1

Creating default startup script /home/jsloan/.vnc/xstartup
Starting applications specified in /home/jsloan/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /home/jsloan/.vnc/lnx1.lander.edu:1.log</pre></blockquote>

The command returns an address or hostname and a display number for
the newly created display, in this instance
<tt class="literal">lnx1.lander.edu:1</tt>. (Alternately, you could start
the <em class="filename">vnc</em> server while seated at the machine and
then go to the client. This will be necessary if you want to run the
server on a Microsoft Windows platform.)
</p><p>

Next, connect a viewer to the display. To start the viewer on a Unix
system, start an X Window session and then use the
<em class="filename">vncviewer</em> command with the host and display
number returned by the viewer program as an argument to the command.
By default, <em class="filename">vncserver</em> uses the
<em class="filename">twm</em> X Window manager, but this can be
reconfigured.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-39">[39]</a> If you are used
to all the clutter that usually comes with <em class="filename">gnome</em>
or something similar, the display may seem a little austere at first
but will perform better. The basic functionality you need will be
there, and you will be able to run whichever X programs you need.
</p><p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-39" /></a>[39]To change the window manager, edit the
file <em class="filename">xstartup</em> in the <em class="filename">.vnc</em>
directory. For example, if you use <em class="filename">gnome</em>, you
would change <tt class="literal">twm</tt> to <tt class="literal">exec</tt>
<tt class="literal">gnome-session.</tt></p><p> </blockquote>

<em class="filename">vnc</em><a name="INDEX-2676" /></a> starts a number of processes;
you'll want to be sure that they are all stopped when you are
done. You can stop <em class="filename">vnc</em> with the
<em class="filename">-kill</em> option as shown here:
</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">lnx1$ vncserver -kill :1
Killing Xvnc process ID 6171</pre></blockquote>

Note that you need to specify only the display number, in this case
<tt class="literal">:1</tt>. You should also be aware that this sometimes
misses a process on some systems. You may need to do a little extra
housekeeping now and then.
</p><p>

Once running, <em class="filename">vnc</em> supports sending special
keystroke combinations such as Ctrl-Alt-Del. If both systems support
it, you can cut and paste ASCII data between windows.
</p><p>

<em class="filename">vnc</em><a name="INDEX-2677" /></a><a name="INDEX-2678" /></a><a name="INDEX-2679" /></a> also provides a reasonable level of
security. Once the password has been set, it is not transmitted over
the network. Rather, a challenge response system is used. In addition
to the password, the Microsoft Windows version of
<em class="filename">vncserver</em> can be configured to accept
connections from only a specific list of hosts. It can also be
configured to use a secure shell (SSH) session. The default port can
be reassigned to simplify configuration with firewalls.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2680" /></a><a name="INDEX-2681" /></a><a name="INDEX-2682" /></a><a name="INDEX-2683" /></a>The
viewer and server can be on the same or different machines or can
even be used on different architectures. <em class="filename">vnc</em>
will run on most platforms. In particular, the viewer will run on
just about any Microsoft Windows machine including Windows CE. It
will run under an X Window session, on Macintoshes, and as plug-ins
for web browsers. <em class="filename">vnc</em> is available in Java, and
the server contains a small web server that can be accessed by some
Java-aware browsers. To do this, you simply add 5800 to the window
number for the HTTP port number. In the previous example, the window
was <tt class="literal">:1</tt>, so the HTTP port number would be
<tt class="literal">:5801</tt>, and the URL would be <em class="emphasis">http://lnx1.lander.edu:5801</em>. 
</p><p>

There is substantial documentation available at the AT&amp;T
Laboratories web site, <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc</a>.<a name="INDEX-2684" /></a><a name="INDEX-2685" /></a>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-11-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.3. ssh</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2686" /></a><a name="INDEX-2687" /></a>One of the problems with
<em class="filename">telnet</em>, <em class="filename">rlogin</em>,
<em class="filename">rsh</em>, and the like is a lack of security.
Passwords are sent in clear text and can be easily captured by any
computer they happen to pass. And with the r-services, it can be very
easy to mimic a trusted system. Attach a laptop to the network, set
the IP address appropriately, and there is a good chance you can
mimic a trusted host.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2688" /></a><a name="INDEX-2689" /></a>One alternative is <em class="filename">ssh</em>,
written by Tatu Yl&ouml;nen, a replacement for the r-services that
uses encryption. While the original version is free, with Version 2
<em class="filename">ssh</em> has evolved into a commercial product,
marketed by SSH Communications Security, Inc. However, Version 2 is
freely available for academic and noncommercial use. Recently, the
OpenSSH project, a spin-off of the OpenBSD project, released a free
port that is compatible with both versions of
<em class="filename">ssh</em> and is covered by the standard BSD license.
</p><p>

<em class="filename">ssh</em><a name="INDEX-2690" /></a><a name="INDEX-2691" /></a><a name="INDEX-2692" /></a><a name="INDEX-2693" /></a><a name="INDEX-2694" /></a><a name="INDEX-2695" /></a><a name="INDEX-2696" /></a><a name="INDEX-2697" /></a> is actually a
set of programs that uses encryption to both authenticate users and
provide encrypted sessions. It provides four levels of
authentication, ranging from trusted users and systems, like
<em class="filename">rsh</em> and <em class="filename">rlogin</em>, to
RSA-based authentication. By doing host authentication as well as
user authentication, DNS, IP, and route spoofing attacks can be
circumvented.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2698" /></a>On
the downside, <em class="filename">ssh</em> provides minimal protection
once your systems have been compromised. Version 1 of the SSH
protocol has also been compromised by man-in-the-middle attacks when
incorrectly configured. Also, some of its authentication methods can
be relatively insecure. <em class="filename">ssh</em> is not trivial to
configure correctly, but fortunately, there is a fair amount of
documentation available for <em class="filename">ssh</em>, including two
books devoted exclusively to <em class="filename">ssh</em>. If you need
particularly robust security, pay close attention to how you
configure it or consider Version 2.
</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2699" /></a><a name="INDEX-2700" /></a><a name="INDEX-2701" /></a>The
legality of <em class="filename">ssh</em> is yet another question. Since
encryption is sometimes the subject of peculiar laws in some
countries, using or exporting <em class="filename">ssh</em> may not be
legal. The OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects avoid some of these problems
by developing code outside of the United States. Consequently, the
distribution of their code is not subject to the United States'
peculiar munitions export laws since it can be obtained outside the
United States.
</p><p>

Despite these concerns, <em class="filename">ssh</em> is something you
should definitely consider if security is an issue.<a name="INDEX-2702" /></a><a name="INDEX-2703" /></a><a name="INDEX-2704" /></a><a name="INDEX-2705" /></a><a name="INDEX-2706" /></a><a name="INDEX-2707" /></a><a name="INDEX-2708" /></a>
