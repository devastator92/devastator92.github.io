<h2 class="sect1">2.2. System Configuration Files</h2>

<a name="INDEX-293" /><a name="INDEX-294" /><a name="INDEX-295" /><a name="INDEX-296" />A major problem with
configuration files under Unix is that there are so many of them in
so many places. On a multiuser system that provides a variety of
services, there may be scores of configuration files scattered among
dozens of directories. Even worse, it seems that every implementation
of Unix is different. Even different releases of the same flavor of
Unix may vary. Add to this the complications that multiple
applications contribute and you have a major undertaking. If you are
running a number of different platforms, you have your work cut out
for you.
</p>

For these reasons, it is unrealistic to attempt to give an exhaustive
list of configuration files. It is possible, however, to discuss
configuration files by categories. The categories can then serve as a
guide or reminder when you construct your own lists so that you
don't overlook an important group of files. Just keep in mind
that what follows is only a starting point. You will have to discover
your particular implementations of Unix one file at a time.
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-2-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.1. Basic Configuration Files</h3>

<a name="INDEX-297" /><a name="INDEX-298" /><a name="INDEX-299" /><a name="INDEX-300" />There are a number of fairly standard
configuration files that seem to show up on most systems. These are
usually, but not always, located in the <em class="filename">/etc</em>
directory. (For customization, you may see a number of files in the
<em class="filename">/usr/local</em> or <em class="filename">/usr/opt</em>
directories or their subdirectories.) When looking at files, this is
clearly the first place to start. Your system will probably include
many of the following: <em class="filename">defaultdomain</em>,
<em class="filename">defaultroute</em>, <em class="filename">ethers</em>,
<em class="filename">gateways</em>,
<em class="filename">host.conf</em>,<em class="filename">
hostname</em>,<em class="filename"> hosts</em>,
<em class="filename">hosts.allow</em>, <em class="filename">hosts.equiv</em>,
<em class="filename">inetd.conf</em>, <em class="filename">localhosts</em>,
<em class="filename">localnetworks</em>, <em class="filename">named.boot</em>,
<em class="filename">netmasks</em>, <em class="filename">networks</em>,
<em class="filename">nodename</em>, <em class="filename">nsswitch.conf</em>,
<em class="filename">protocols</em>, <em class="filename">rc</em>,
<em class="filename">rc.conf, rc.local</em>,
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>, and<em class="filename"> services</em>.
You won't find all of these on a single system. Each version
and release will have its own conventions. For example, Solaris puts
the host's name in <em class="filename">nodename</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a>
With BSD, it is set in <em class="filename">rc.conf</em>. Customizations
may change these as well. Thus, the locations and names of files will
vary from system to system.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" />[7]The hostname may be used in other files as well so don't
try to change the hostname by editing these files. Use the
<em class="filename">hostname</em> command instead.</p> </blockquote>

One starting point might be to scan all the files in
<em class="filename">/etc</em> and its subdirectories, trying to identify
which ones are relevant. In the long run, you may want to know the
role of all the files in <em class="filename">/etc</em>, but you
don't need to do this all at once.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-301" /><a name="INDEX-302" />There are a few files or groups of files
that will be of particular interest. One of the most important is
<em class="filename">inetd.conf</em>. While we can piece together what is
probably being handled by <em class="filename">inetd</em> by using
<em class="filename">ps</em> in combination with
<em class="filename">netstat</em>, an examination of
<em class="filename">inetd.conf</em> is usually much quicker and safer. On
an unfamiliar system, this is one of the first places you will want
to look. Be sure to compare this to the output provided by
<em class="filename">netstat</em>. Services that you can't match to
running processes or <em class="filename">inetd</em> are a cause for
concern.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-303" /><a name="INDEX-304" />You will also want to examine files like
<em class="filename">host.conf</em>, <em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>, and
<em class="filename">nsswitch.conf</em> to discover how name resolution is
done. Be sure to examine files that establish trust relationships
like <em class="filename">hosts.allow</em>. This is absolutely essential
if you are having, or want to avoid, security problems. (There is
more on some of these files in the discussion of
<em class="filename">tcpwrappers</em> in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Miscellaneous Tools"</a>.)
</p>

Finally, there is one group of these files, the
<em class="filename">rc</em> files, that deserve particular attention.
These are discussed separately in the later section on startup files
and scripts.

<h3 class="sect2">2.2.2. Configuration Programs</h3>

<a name="INDEX-305" /><a name="INDEX-306" /><a name="INDEX-307" /><a name="INDEX-308" />Over the years, Unix has been heavily
criticized because of its terse command-line interface. As a result,
many GUI applications have been developed. System administration has
not escaped this trend. These utilities can be used to display as
well as change system configurations.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-309" /><a name="INDEX-310" /><a name="INDEX-311" /><a name="INDEX-312" /><a name="INDEX-313" /><a name="INDEX-314" />Once again, every flavor of
Unix will be different. With Solaris, <em class="filename">admintool</em>
was the torchbearer for years. In recent years, this has been
superseded with <em class="filename">Solstice AdminSuite</em>. With
FreeBSD, select the <em class="filename">configure</em> item from the menu
presented when you run <em class="filename">/stand/sysinstall</em>. With
Linux you can use <em class="filename">linuxconf</em>. Both the menu and
GUI versions of this program are common. The list goes on.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-2-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.3. Kernel</h3>

<a name="INDEX-315" /><a name="INDEX-316" /><a name="INDEX-317" />It's natural to assume
that examining the kernel's configuration might be an important
first step. But while it may, in fact, be essential in resolving some
key issues, in general, it is usually not the most productive place
to look. You may want to postpone this until it seems absolutely
necessary or you have lots of free time.
</p>

As you know, the first step in starting a system is loading and
initializing the kernel. Network services rely on the kernel being
configured correctly. Some services will be available only if first
enabled in the kernel. While examining the kernel's
configuration won't tell you which services are actually being
used, it can give some insight into what is not available. For
example, if the kernel is not configured to forward IP packets, then
clearly the system is not being used as a router, even if it has
multiple interfaces. On the other hand, it doesn't immediately
follow that a system is configured as a firewall just because the
kernel has been compiled to support filtering.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-318" /><a name="INDEX-319" />Changes to the kernel will
usually be required only when building a new system, installing a new
service or new hardware, or tuning system performance. Changing the
kernel will not normally be needed to simply discover how a system is
configured. However, changes may be required to use some of the tools
described later in this book. For example, some versions of FreeBSD
have not, by default, enabled the Berkeley packet filter
pseudodriver. Thus, it is necessary to recompile the kernel to enable
this before some packet capture software, such as
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>, can be run on these systems.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-320" /><a name="INDEX-321" /><a name="INDEX-322" />To recompile a kernel, you'll
need to consult the documentation for your operating system for the
specifics. Usually, recompiling a kernel first requires editing
configuration files. This may be done manually or with the aid of a
utility created for this task. For example, with Linux, the command
<em class="filename">make config</em> runs an interactive program that
sets appropriate parameters.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a>
BSD uses a program called <em class="filename">config</em>. If you can
locate the configuration files used, you can see how the kernel was
configured. But, if the kernel has been rebuilt a number of times
without following a consistent naming scheme, this can be
surprisingly difficult.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-8" />[8]You can also use
<em class="filename">make xconfig </em>or <em class="filename">make
menuconfig</em>. These are more interactive, allowing you to go
back and change parameters once you have moved on. <em class="filename">make
config </em>is unforgiving in this respect.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-323" />As an example, on BSD-derived systems,
the kernel configuration files are usually found in the directory
<em class="filename">/sys/</em><em class="replaceable">arch</em><em class="filename">/</em><em class="emphasis">conf</em><em class="filename">/</em><em class="replaceable">kernel</em>where <em class="replaceable">arch</em> corresponds to the
architecture of the system and <em class="replaceable">kernel</em> is
the name of the kernel. With FreeBSD, the file might be
<em class="filename">/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC</em> if the kernel has not
been recompiled. In Linux, the configuration file is
<em class="filename">.config</em> in whatever directory the kernel was
unpacked in, usually <em class="filename">/usr/src/linux/</em>.
</p>

As you might expect, lines beginning with a <tt class="literal">#</tt> are
comments. What you'll probably want to look for are lines
specifying unusual options. For example, it is not difficult to guess
that the following lines from a FreeBSD system indicate that the
machine may be used as a firewall:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">...
#  Firewall options
options         IPFIREWALL
options         IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=25
...</pre></blockquote>

Some entries can be pretty cryptic, but hopefully there are some
comments. The Unix manpages for a system may describe some options.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-324" /><a name="INDEX-325" />Unfortunately, there is very little
consistency from one version of Unix to the next on how such files
are named, where they are located, what information they may contain,
or how they are used. For example, Solaris uses the file
<em class="emphasis">/etc/system</em> to hold some directives, although
there is little of interest in this file for our purposes. IRIX keeps
its files in the <em class="filename">/var/sysgen/system</em> directory.
For Linux, take a look at <em class="filename">/etc/conf.modules</em>. The
list goes on.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-9" />[9]While general configuration parameters
should be in a single file, a huge number of files are actually
involved. If you have access to FreeBSD, you might look at
<em class="filename">/sys/conf/files </em>to get some idea of this. This
is a list of the files FreeBSD uses.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-326" /><a name="INDEX-327" /><a name="INDEX-328" />It is usually possible to
examine or change selected system parameters for an existing kernel.
For example, Solaris has the utilities <em class="filename">sysdef</em>,
<em class="filename">prtconf</em>, and <em class="filename">ndd</em>. For our
purposes, <em class="filename">ndd</em> is the most interesting and should
provide the flavor of how such utilities work.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-329" />Specifically,
<em class="filename">ndd</em> allows you to get or set driver
configuration parameters. You will probably want to begin by listing
configurable options. Specifying the driver (i.e.,
<em class="filename">/dev/arp</em>, <em class="filename">/dev/icmp</em>,
<em class="filename">/dev/ip</em>, <em class="filename">/dev/tcp</em>, and
<em class="filename">/dev/udp</em>) with the <em class="filename">?</em> option
will return the parameters available for that driver. Here is an
example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sol1# ndd /dev/arp ?
?                             (read only)
arp_cache_report              (read only)
arp_debug                     (read and write)
arp_cleanup_interval          (read and write)</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-330" />This shows three parameters that can
be examined, although only two can be changed. We can examine an
individual parameter by using its name as an argument. For example,
we can retrieve the ARP table as shown here:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sol1# ndd /dev/arp arp_cache_report
ifname   proto addr      proto mask      hardware addr     flags
elxl0    205.153.060.053 255.255.255.255 00:e0:29:21:3c:0b
elxl0    205.153.060.055 255.255.255.255 00:90:27:43:72:70
elxl0    205.153.060.001 255.255.255.255 00:00:a2:c6:0e:42
elxl0    205.153.060.005 255.255.255.255 00:90:27:9c:2d:c6
elxl0    205.153.060.248 255.255.255.255 00:60:97:58:71:b7 PERM PUBLISH MYADDR
elxl0    205.153.060.150 255.255.255.255 00:c0:05:04:2d:78
elxl0    224.000.000.000 240.000.000.000 01:00:5e:00:00:00 PERM MAPPING</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-331" /><a name="INDEX-332" />In this instance, it is
fairly easy to guess the meaning of what's returned. (This
output is for the same ARP table that we looked at with the
<em class="filename">arp</em> command.) Sometimes, what's returned
can be quite cryptic. This example returns the value of the IP
forwarding parameter:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># ndd /dev/ip ip_forwarding
0</pre></blockquote>

It is far from obvious how to interpret this result. In fact,
<tt class="literal">0</tt> means never forward, <tt class="literal">1</tt> means
always forward, and <tt class="literal">2</tt> means forward only when two
or more interfaces are up. I've never been able to locate a
definitive source for this sort of information, although a number of
the options are described in an appendix to W. Richard Stevens'
<em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Illustrated</em>, vol. 1. If you want to
change parameters, you can invoke the program interactively.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-333" /><a name="INDEX-334" />Other versions of Unix will have
their own files and utilities. For example, BSD has the
<em class="filename">sysctl</em> command. This example shows that IP
forwarding is disabled:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-335" />The manpages
provide additional guidance, but to know what to change, you may have
to delve into the source code. With AIX, there is the
<em class="filename">no</em> utility. As I have said before, the list goes
on.
</p>

This brief description should give you a general idea of what's
involved in gleaning information about the kernel, but you will want
to go to the appropriate documentation for your system. It should be
clear that it takes a fair degree of experience to extract this kind
of information. Occasionally, there is a bit of information that can
be obtained only this way, but, in general, this is not the most
profitable place to start.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-336" /><a name="INDEX-337" /><a name="INDEX-338" /><a name="INDEX-339" />One last comment -- if you are intent
on examining the behavior of the kernel, you will almost certainly
want to look at the messages it produces when booting. On most
systems, these can be retrieved with the <em class="filename">dmesg</em>
command. These can be helpful in determining what network hardware
your system has and what drivers it uses. For hardware, however, I
generally prefer opening the case and looking inside. Accessing the
CMOS is another approach for discovering the hardware that
doesn't require opening the box.<a name="INDEX-340" /><a name="INDEX-341" /><a name="INDEX-342" /> 
</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-2-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.4. Startup Files and Scripts</h3>

<a name="INDEX-343" /><a name="INDEX-344" /><a name="INDEX-345" /><a name="INDEX-346" /><a name="INDEX-347" /><a name="INDEX-348" /><a name="INDEX-349" />Once the kernel is loaded, the swapper
or scheduler is started and then the <em class="filename">init</em>
process runs. This process will, in turn, run a number of startup
scripts that will start the various services and do additional
configuration chores.
</p>

After the standard configuration files, these are the next group of
files you might want to examine. These will primarily be scripts, but
may include configuration files read by the scripts. In general, it
is a bad idea to bury configuration parameters within these scripts,
but this is still done at times. You should also be prepared to read
fairly cryptic shell code. It is hoped that most of these will be
either in their pristine state, heavily commented, or both.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-350" /><a name="INDEX-351" /><a name="INDEX-352" /><a name="INDEX-353" />Look for three things when examining these
files. First, some networking parameters may be buried in these
files. You will not want to miss these. Next, there may be calls to
network configuration utilities such as <em class="filename">route</em> or
<em class="filename">ifconfig</em>. These are frequently customizations,
so read these with a critical eye. Finally, networking applications
such as <em class="filename">sendmail</em> may be started from these
files. I strongly urge that you create a list of all applications
that are run automatically at startup.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-354" /><a name="INDEX-355" />For
systems derived from BSD, you should look for files in
<em class="filename">/etc</em> beginning with <em class="filename">rc</em>. Be
sure to look at <em class="filename">rc.conf</em> and any
<em class="filename">rc</em> files with extensions indicating a networking
function of interest, e.g., <em class="filename">rc.firewall</em>. Realize
that many of these will be templates for services that you may not be
using. For example, if you see the file <em class="filename">rc.atm</em>,
don't be too disappointed when you can't find your ATM
connection.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-356" /><a name="INDEX-357" /><a name="INDEX-358" /><a name="INDEX-359" /><a name="INDEX-360" /><a name="INDEX-361" /><a name="INDEX-362" /><a name="INDEX-363" /><a name="INDEX-364" /><a name="INDEX-365" /><a name="INDEX-366" /><a name="INDEX-367" />Unix systems can typically be booted in
one of several different states or run levels that determine which
services are started. For example, run level 1 is single-user mode
and is used for system maintenance. The services started by the
different run levels vary somewhat among the different flavors of
Unix. If your system is derived from System V, then the files will be
in a half dozen or so directories in <em class="emphasis">/etc</em>. These
are named <em class="filename">rc1.d</em>, <em class="filename">rc2.d</em>, and
so forth. The digit indicates the run level of the system when
booted. Networking scripts are usually in <em class="filename">rc2.d</em>.
In each directory, there will be scripts starting with an <em class="emphasis">S</em>
or a <em class="emphasis">K</em> and a two-digit number. The
rest of the name should give some indication of the function of the
file. Files with names beginning with an <em class="emphasis">S</em> are
started in numerical order when the system is rebooted. When the
system shuts down, the files with <em class="emphasis">K</em> are run.
(Some versions of Linux, such as Red Hat, follow this basic approach
but group these directories together in the
<em class="filename">/etc/rc.d</em> directory. Others, such as Debian,
follow the System V approach.)
</p>

<a name="ch02-18-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>WARNING: </b>
<a name="INDEX-368" />There is one serious catch with all
this. When versions of operating systems change, sometimes the
locations of files change. For backward compatibility, links may be
created to old locations. For example, on recent versions of Solaris,
the network configuration file <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> is
actually a link to <em class="filename">/etc/inet/hosts</em>. There are
other important network configuration files that are really in
<em class="filename">/etc/inet</em>, not <em class="filename">/etc</em>.
Similarly, some of the startup scripts are really links to files in
<em class="filename">/etc/init.d</em>. If the link is somehow broken, you
may find yourself editing the wrong version of a file and wondering
why the system is ignoring your changes.

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-2-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.5. Other Files</h3>

There are several other categories of files that are worth mentioning
briefly. If you have been following the steps just described, you
will already have found most of these, but it may be worth mentioning
them separately just in case you have overlooked something.
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-2-SECT-2.5.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.5.1. Application files</h3>

<a name="INDEX-369" /><a name="INDEX-370" /><a name="INDEX-371" /><a name="INDEX-372" />Once you have your list of applications
that are started automatically, investigate how each application is
configured. When it comes to configuration files, each application
will follow its own conventions. The files may be grouped together,
reside in a couple of directories, or have some distributed structure
that spans a number of directories. For example,
<em class="filename">sendmail</em> usually keeps configuration files
together, usually in <em class="filename">/etc</em> or in
<em class="filename">/etc/mail</em>. DNS may have a couple of files in
<em class="filename">/etc</em> to get things started, with the database
files grouped together somewhere else. A web server like
<em class="filename">apache</em> may have an extensive set of files
distributed across a number of directories, particularly if you
consider content. But beware, your particular implementation may vary
from the norm -- in that case, all bets are off. You will need to
look for these on an application-by-application and a
system-by-system basis.
</p>

</div>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-2-SECT-2.5.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.5.2. Security files</h3>

<a name="INDEX-373" /><a name="INDEX-374" /><a name="INDEX-375" />It is
likely you will have already discovered relevant security files at
this point, but if you are having problems, this is something worth
revisiting. There are several different categories to consider:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Trust relationships</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-376" />Some
files such as <em class="filename">/etc/hosts.equiv</em> set up trust
relationships with other computers. You will definitely want to
review these. Keep in mind that users can establish their own trust
relationships, so don't forget the <em class="filename">.rhost</em>
file in home directories if you are having problems tied to specific
users.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Traffic control</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-377" /><a name="INDEX-378" /><a name="INDEX-379" />A number of files
may be tied to general access or the control of traffic. These
include configuration files for applications like
<em class="filename">tcpwrappers</em> or firewall configuration files.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Application specific</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-380" />Don't forget that individual
applications may have security files as well. For example, the file
<em class="filename">/etc/ftpusers</em> may be used by
<em class="filename">ftp</em> to restrict access. These are very easy to
overlook.

<a name="INDEX-381" /><a name="INDEX-382" /><a name="INDEX-383" />One last
category of files you might want to consider is log files. Strictly
speaking, these are not configuration files. Apart from an occasional
startup message, these may not tell you very much about your
system's configuration. But occasionally, these will provide
the missing puzzle piece for resolving a problem. Log files are
