<h2 class="sect1">5.5. Analysis Tools</h2>

<a name="INDEX-1106" /><a name="INDEX-1107" /><a name="INDEX-1108" /><a name="INDEX-1109" />As
previously noted, one reason for using <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>
is the wide variety of support tools that are available for use with
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em> or files created with
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>. There are tools for sanitizing the
data, tools for reformatting the data, and tools for presenting and
analyzing the data.
</p>

<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.1. sanitize</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1110" /><a name="INDEX-1111" /><a name="INDEX-1112" /><a name="INDEX-1113" />If you are particularly sensitive to
privacy or security concerns, you may want to consider
<em class="filename">sanitize</em>, a collection of five Bourne shell
scripts that reduce or condense <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> trace
files and eliminate confidential information. The scripts renumber
host entries and select classes of packets, eliminating all others.
This has two primary uses. First, it reduces the size of the files
you must deal with, hopefully focusing your attention on a subset of
the original traffic that still contains the traffic of interest.
Second, it gives you data that can be distributed or made public (for
debugging or network analysis) without compromising individual
privacy or revealing too much specific information about your
network. Clearly, these scripts won't be useful for everyone.
But if internal policies constrain what you can reveal, these scripts
are worth looking into.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1114" /><a name="INDEX-1115" /><a name="INDEX-1116" /><a name="INDEX-1117" />The five scripts included in
<em class="filename">sanitize</em> are <em class="filename">sanitize-tcp</em>,
<em class="filename">sanitize-syn-fin</em>,
<em class="filename">sanitize-udp</em>,
<em class="filename">sanitize-encap</em>, and
<em class="filename">sanitize-other</em>. Each script filters out
inappropriate traffic and reduces the remaining traffic. For example,
all non-TCP packets are removed by <em class="filename">sanitize-tcp</em>
and the remaining TCP traffic is reduced to six fields -- an
unformatted timestamp, a renumbered source address, a renumbered
destination address, the source port, a destination address, and the
number of data bytes in the packet.

would be reduced to <tt class="literal">934303014.772066 1 2 1174 23
0.</tt> Notice that the IP numbers have been replaced with
<tt class="literal">1</tt> and <tt class="literal">2</tt>, respectively. This
will be done in a consistent manner with multiple packets so you will
still be able to compare addresses within a single trace. The actual
data reported varies from script to script. Here is an example of the
syntax:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# sanitize-tcp tracefile</pre></blockquote>

This runs <em class="filename">sanitize-tcp</em> over the
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em> trace file
<em class="filename">tracefile</em>. There are no arguments.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.2. tcpdpriv</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1118" /><a name="INDEX-1119" /><a name="INDEX-1120" />The
program <em class="filename">tcpdpriv</em> is another program for removing
sensitive information from <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> files. There
are several major differences between <em class="filename">tcpdpriv</em>
and <em class="filename">sanitize</em>. First, as a shell script,
<em class="filename">sanitize</em> should run on almost any Unix system.
As a compiled program, this is not true of
<em class="filename">tcpdpriv</em>. On the other hand,
<em class="filename">tcpdpriv</em> supports the direct capture of data as
well as the analysis of existing files. The captured packets are
written as a <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> file, which can be
subsequently processed.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1121" /><a name="INDEX-1122" /><a name="INDEX-1123" /><a name="INDEX-1124" />Also,
<em class="filename">tcpdpriv</em> allows you some degree of control over
how much of the original data is removed or scrambled. For example,
it is possible to have an IP address scrambled but retain its class
designation. If the <em class="filename">-C4</em> option is chosen, an IP
address such as <em class="filename">205.153.63.238</em> might be replaced
with <em class="filename">193.0.0.2</em>. Notice that address classes are
preserved -- a class C address is replaced with a class C address.
</p>

There are a variety of command-line options that control how data is
rewritten, several of which are mandatory. Many of the command-line
options will look familiar to <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> users. The
program does not allow output to be written to a terminal, so it must
be written directly to a file or redirected. While a useful program,
the number of required command-line options can be annoying. There is
some concern that if the options are not selected properly, it may be
possible to reconstruct the original data from the scrambled data. In
practice, this should be a minor concern.
</p>

As an example of using <em class="filename">tcpdpriv</em>, the following
command will scramble the file <em class="filename">tracefile</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcpdpriv -P99 -C4 -M20 -r tracefile -w outfile</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1125" /><a name="INDEX-1126" /><a name="INDEX-1127" />The <em class="filename">-P99</em>
option preserves (doesn't scramble) the port numbers,
<em class="filename">-C4</em> preserves the class identity of the IP
addresses, and <em class="filename">-M20</em> preserves multicast
addresses. If you want the data output to your terminal, you can pipe
the output to <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcpdpriv -P99 -C4 -M20 -r tracefile -w- | tcpdump -r-</pre></blockquote>

The last options look a little strange, but they will work.</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.3. tcpflow</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1128" /><a name="INDEX-1129" /><a name="INDEX-1130" /><a name="INDEX-1131" /><a name="INDEX-1132" /><a name="INDEX-1133" /><a name="INDEX-1134" />Another useful tool is
<em class="filename">tcpflow</em>, written by Jeremy Elson. This program
allows you to capture individual TCP flows or sessions. If the
traffic you are looking at includes, say, three different Telnet
sessions, <em class="filename">tcpflow</em> will separate the traffic into
three different files so you can examine each individually. The
program can reconstruct data streams regardless of out-of-order
packets or retransmissions but does not understand fragmentation.
</p>

<em class="filename">tcpflow</em><a name="INDEX-1135" /><a name="INDEX-1136" />
stores each flow in a separate file with names based on the source
and destination addresses and ports. For example, SSH traffic (port
22) between <em class="filename">172.16.2.210</em> and
<em class="filename">205.153.63.30</em> might have the filename
<em class="filename">172.016.002.210.00022-205.153.063.030.01071,</em>
where 1071 is the ephemeral port created for the session.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1137" /><a name="INDEX-1138" /><a name="INDEX-1139" />Since <em class="filename">tcpflow</em> uses
<em class="filename">libpcap</em>, the same packet capture library
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em> uses, capture filters are constructed in
exactly the same way and with the same syntax. It can be used in a
number of ways. For example, you could see what cookies are being
sent during an HTTP session. Or you might use it to see if SSH is
really encrypting your data. Of course, you could also use it to
capture passwords or read email, so be sure to set permissions
correctly.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.4. tcp-reduce</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1140" /><a name="INDEX-1141" /><a name="INDEX-1142" /><a name="INDEX-1143" />The program <em class="filename">tcp-reduce</em>
invokes a collection of shell scripts to reduce the packet capture
information in a <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> trace file to one-line
summaries for each connection. That is, an entire Telnet session
would be summarized by a single line. This could be extremely useful
in getting an overall picture of how the traffic over a link breaks
down or for looking quickly at very large files.
</p>

The syntax is quite simple.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcp-reduce tracefile &gt; outfile</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1144" />will reduce <em class="filename">tracefile</em>,
putting the output in <em class="filename">outfile.</em> The program
<em class="filename">tcp-summary</em>, which comes with
<em class="filename">tcp-reduce</em>, will further summarize the results.
For example, on my system I traced a system briefly with
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>. This process collected 741 packets.
When processed with <em class="filename">tcp-reduce</em>, this revealed 58
TCP connections. Here is an example when results were passed to
<em class="filename">tcp-summary</em> :
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcp-reduce out-file | tcp-summary</pre></blockquote>

This example produced the following five-line summary:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto        # conn   KBytes    % SF % loc % ngh
-----        ------   ------    ---- ----- -----
www              56       35      25     0     0
telnet            1        1     100     0     0
pop-3             1        0     100     0     0</pre></blockquote>

In this instance, this clearly shows that the HTTP traffic dominated
the local network traffic.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.5. tcpshow</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1145" /><a name="INDEX-1146" /><a name="INDEX-1147" /><a name="INDEX-1148" /><a name="INDEX-1149" />The program <em class="filename">tcpshow</em>
decodes a <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> trace file. It represents an
alternative to using <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> to decode data. The
primary advantage of <em class="filename">tcpshow</em> is much nicer
formatting for output. For example, here is the
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em> output for a packet:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">12:36:54.772066 sloan.lander.edu.1174 &gt; 205.153.63.238.telnet: . ack 
3259091394 win 8647 (DF) b</pre></blockquote>

Here is corresponding output from <em class="filename">tcpshow</em> for
the same packet:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcpshow &lt; trace-file</pre></blockquote>

There are numerous options.</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.6. tcpslice</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1150" /><a name="INDEX-1151" /><a name="INDEX-1152" /><a name="INDEX-1153" />The program
<em class="filename">tcpslice</em> is a simple but useful program for
extracting pieces or merging <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> files. This
is a useful utility for managing larger <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>
files. You specify a starting time and optionally an ending time for
a file, and it extracts the corresponding records from the source
file. If multiple files are specified, it extracts packets from the
first file and then continues extracting only those packets from the
next file that have a later timestamp. This prevents duplicate
packets if you have overlapping trace files.
</p>

While there are a few options, the basic syntax is quite simple. For
example, consider the command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcpslice 934224220.0000 in-file &gt; out-file</pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-1154" />This will extract all packets with
timestamps after <tt class="literal">934224220.0000</tt>. Note the use of
an unformatted timestamp. This is the same format displayed with the
<em class="filename">-tt</em> option with <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>.
Note also the use of redirection. Because it works with binary files,
<em class="filename">tcpslice</em> will not allow you to send output to
your terminal. See the manpage for additional options.
</p>

</div>
<a name="nettroubletools-CHP-5-SECT-5.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.7. tcptrace</h3>

<a name="INDEX-1155" /><a name="INDEX-1156" />This program is an extremely
powerful <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> file analysis tool. The program
<em class="filename">tcptrace</em> is strictly an analysis tool, not a
capture program, but it works with a variety of capture file formats.
The tool's primary focus is the analysis of TCP connections. As
such, it is more of a network management tool than a packet analysis
tool. The program provides several levels of output or analysis
ranging from very brief to very detailed.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1157" /><a name="INDEX-1158" /><a name="INDEX-1159" /><a name="INDEX-1160" /><a name="INDEX-1161" /><a name="INDEX-1162" /><a name="INDEX-1163" /><a name="INDEX-1164" /><a name="INDEX-1165" />While for most purposes
<em class="filename">tcptrace</em> is used as a command-line tool,
<em class="filename">tcptrace</em> is capable of producing several types
of output files for plotting with the X Window program
<em class="filename">xplot</em>. These include <em class="emphasis">time sequence
graphs</em>, <em class="emphasis">throughput graphs</em>, and graphs
of <em class="emphasis">round-trip times</em>. Time sequence graphs
(<em class="filename">-S </em>option) are plots of sequence numbers over
time that give a picture of the activity on the network. Throughput
graphs (<em class="filename">-T</em> option), as the name implies, plot
throughput in bytes per second against time. While throughput gives a
picture of the volume of traffic on the network, round-trip times
give a better picture of the delays seen by individual connections.
Round-trip time plots (<em class="filename">-R</em> option) display
individual round-trip times over time. For other graphs and graphing
options, consult the documentation.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1166" /><a name="INDEX-1167" />For normal text-based operations,
there are an overwhelming number of options and possibilities. One of
the most useful is the <em class="filename">-l</em> option. This produces
a long listing of summary statistics on a connection-by-connection
basis. What follows is an example of the information provided for a
single brief Telnet connection:

This was produced by using <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> to capture
all traffic into the file <em class="filename">telnet.trace</em> and then
executing <em class="filename">tcptrace</em> to process the data. Here is
the syntax required to produce this output:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">bsd1# tcptrace -l telnet.trace</pre></blockquote>

Similar output is produced for each TCP connection recorded in the
trace file. Obviously, a protocol (like HTTP) that uses many
different sessions may overwhelm you with output.
</p>

There is a lot more to this program than covered in this brief
discussion. If your primary goal is analysis of network performance
and related problems rather than individual packet analysis, this is
a very useful tool.<a name="INDEX-1168" />

<a name="INDEX-1169" /><a name="INDEX-1170" /><a name="INDEX-1171" />The program <em class="filename">trafshow</em>
is a packet capture program of a different sort. It provides a
continuous display of traffic over the network, giving repeated
snapshots of traffic. It displays the source address, destination
address, protocol, and number of bytes. This program would be most
useful in looking for suspicious traffic or just getting a general
idea of network traffic.
</p>

While <em class="filename">trafshow</em> can be run on a text-based
terminal, it effectively takes over the display. It is best used in a
separate window of a windowing system. There are a number of options,

discussed <em class="filename">tcpdump</em> in detail because it is the
most widely available packet capture program for Unix. Many
implementations of Unix have proprietary packet capture programs that
are comparable to <em class="filename">tcpdump</em>. For example, Sun
Microsystems' Solaris provides <em class="filename">snoop</em>.
(This is a replacement for <em class="filename">etherfind,</em> which was
supplied with earlier versions of the Sun operating system.)
</p>

Here is an example of using <em class="filename">snoop</em> to capture
five packets:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sol1&gt; snoop -c5
Using device /dev/elxl (promiscuous mode)
172.16.2.210 -&gt; sol1         TELNET C port=28863
        sol1 -&gt; 172.16.2.210 TELNET R port=28863 /dev/elxl (promiscuo
172.16.2.210 -&gt; sol1         TELNET C port=28863
172.16.2.210 -&gt; sloan.lander.edu TCP D=1071 S=22     Ack=143990 Seq=3737542069 Len=60 Win=17520
sloan.lander.edu -&gt; 172.16.2.210 TCP D=22 S=1071     Ack=3737542129 Seq=143990 Len=0 Win=7908
snoop: 5 packets captured</pre></blockquote>

As you can see, it is used pretty much the same way as
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>. (Actually, the output has a slightly
more readable format.) <em class="filename">snoop</em>, like
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>, supports a wide range of options and
filters. You should have no trouble learning
<em class="filename">snoop</em> if you have ever used
<em class="filename">tcpdump</em>.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-1187" /><a name="INDEX-1188" />Other systems will provide their own
equivalents (for example, AIX provides <em class="filename">iptrace</em>
). While the syntax is different, these tools are used in much the
same way.
