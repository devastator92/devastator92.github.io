<h2 class="sect1">9.4. Forwarding Security: TCP-wrappers and libwrap</h2>



<a name="INDEX-1490" />At several
points in this chapter, we have talked about security issues and
limitations of forwarding. So far, we've seen very little
control over who can connect to a forwarded port. The SSH1 and
OpenSSH default is to allow connections only from the local host,
which is reasonably secure for a single-user machine. But if you need
to allow connections from elsewhere, you have a problem, since
it's all or nothing: to allow connections from elsewhere (using
<span class="option">-g</span> or
<a name="INDEX-1491" /><tt class="literal">GatewayPorts=yes</tt>),
you must allow them from anywhere. And with SSH2 it's worse:
forwarded ports will always accept connections from anywhere. X
forwarding is in a slightly better position, since the X protocol has
its own authentication, but you might still prefer to restrict
access, preventing intruders from exploiting an unknown security flaw
or performing a denial-of-service attack. SSH on the Unix platform
provides an optional feature for access control based on the client
address, called <em class="emphasis">TCP-wrappers</em>.</p>



The term TCP-wrappers refers to software written by Wietse Venema. If
it isn't already installed in your Unix distribution, you can
get it at:</p>



<blockquote class="simplelist">

<a href="ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html">ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html</a></p>

</blockquote>



TCP-wrappers are a global access control mechanism that integrates
with other TCP-based servers, such as <tt class="command">sshd</tt> or
<tt class="command">telnetd</tt>. Access control is based on the source
address of incoming TCP connections. That is, a TCP-wrapper permits
or denies connections based on their origin, as specified in the
configuration files
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.allow</em><a name="INDEX-1492" />
and
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.deny.</em><a name="INDEX-1493" />
<a href="ch09_04.html#ch09-18511">Figure 9-12</a> shows where TCP-wrappers fit into the
scheme of SSH configuration.</p>



<a name="ch09-18511" /><div class="figure"><img height="339" alt="Figure 9-12" src="figs/ssh_0912.gif" width="482" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-12. TCP-wrappers and SSH configuration (highlighted parts)</h4>

There are two ways to use TCP-wrappers. The most common method,
<em class="emphasis">wrapping</em>, is applied to TCP servers that are
normally invoked by <tt class="command">inetd</tt>. You "wrap"
the server by editing <em class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</em> and
modifying the server's configuration line. Instead of invoking
the server directly, you invoke the TCP-wrapper daemon,
<tt class="command">tcpd</tt><a name="INDEX-1494" />,
which in turn invokes the original server. Then, you edit the
TCP-wrapper configuration files to specify your desired access
control. <tt class="command">tcpd</tt> makes authorization decisions based
on the their contents.</p>



The <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> technique applies access control
without having to modify the TCP server program. This is nice.
However, <tt class="command">sshd</tt> is usually not invoked by
<tt class="command">inetd</tt> [<a href="ch05_04.html#ch05-58373">Section 5.4.3.2, "Invocation by inetd"</a>], so the second
method, <em class="emphasis">source code modification</em>, must be
applied. To participate in TCP-wrapper control, the SSH server must
be compiled with the flag
<tt class="literal"> -- with-libwrap</tt><a name="INDEX-1495" /> to enable
internal support for TCP-wrappers. [<a href="ch04_01.html#ch04-29328">Section 4.1.5.3, "TCP/IP support"</a>]
<tt class="command">sshd</tt> then invokes TCP-wrapper library functions to
do explicit access-control checks according to the rules in
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.allow</em> and
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.deny.</em> So in a sense, the term
"wrapper" is misleading since <tt class="command">sshd</tt> is
modified, not wrapped, to support TCP-wrappers. <a href="ch09_04.html#ch09-16826">Figure 9-13</a> illustrates the process.</p>



<a name="ch09-16826" /><div class="figure"><img height="259" alt="Figure 9-13" src="figs/ssh_0913.gif" width="246" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-13. TCP-wrapper (libwrap) operation</h4>

<h3 class="sect2">9.4.1. TCP-wrappers Configuration</h3>



<a name="INDEX-1496" />The
access control language for TCP-wrappers has quite a few options and
may vary depending on whose package you use and what version it is.
We won't cover the language completely in this book. Consult
your local documentation for a complete understanding: the manpages
on <em class="emphasis">tcpd</em> (8), <em class="emphasis">hosts_access
</em>(5), and <em class="emphasis">hosts_options</em> (5). We will
just indicate some simple, common configurations.</p>



The TCP-wrapper configuration is kept in the files
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.allow</em> and
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.deny.</em> These files contain patterns of the form:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">service_1 [service_2 service_3 ...] : client_1 [client_2 client_3 ...]</pre></blockquote>



Each pattern matches some (server,client) pairs, and hence may match
a particular client/server TCP connection. Specifically, a connection
between client C and server S matches this rule if some service
<em class="emphasis">service_i</em> matches S, and some
<em class="emphasis">client_j</em> matches C. (We explain the format and
matching rules for these subpatterns shortly.) The
<em class="filename">hosts.allow</em> file is searched first, followed by
<em class="filename">hosts.deny</em>. If a matching pattern is found in
<em class="filename">hosts.allow</em>, the connection is allowed. If none
is found there, but one matches in <em class="filename">hosts.deny</em>,
the connection is dropped. Finally, if no patterns match in either
file, the connection is allowed. Nonexistence of either file is
treated as if the file existed and contained no matching patterns.
Note that the default, then, is to allow everything.</p>



There is also an extended syntax, documented on the
<em class="filename">hosts_options </em>(5) manpage. It may or may not be
available, depending on how your TCP-wrapper library was built. It
has many more options, but in particular, it allows tagging an
individual rule as denying or rejecting a matching connection; for
example:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">sshd1 : bad.host.com : DENY</pre></blockquote>



Using this syntax, you can put all your rules into the
<em class="filename">hosts.allow</em> file, rather than having to use both
files. To reject anything not explicitly allowed, just put
<tt class="literal">ALL: ALL:DENY</tt> at the end of the file.</p>



In a pattern, each
<a name="INDEX-1497" />service
is a name indicating a server to which this pattern applies. SSH
recognizes the following service names:</p>



<dl>
<dt><i>sshd</i></dt>
<dd>The main SSH server. This can be <tt class="command">sshd</tt>,
<tt class="command">sshd1</tt>, <tt class="command">sshd2</tt>, or whatever name
you invoke the daemon under (its <em class="emphasis">argv[0]</em> value).</p></dd>


<a name="INDEX-1498" />
<dt><i>sshdfwd-x11</i></dt>
<dd>The X forwarding port.</p></dd>


<a name="INDEX-1499" />
<dt><i>sshdfwd-<em class="emphasis">N</em></i></dt>
<dd>Forwarded TCP port <em class="emphasis">N</em> (e.g., forwarded port 2001
is <tt class="literal">service</tt> <tt class="literal">sshdfwd-2001</tt>).</p></dd>

</dl>



<a name="ch09-37-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b>
The X and port forwarding control features are available only in SSH1
and SSH2; OpenSSH uses only <em class="emphasis">libwrap</em> to control
access to the main server.</p>


</blockquote>

Each <em class="emphasis">client</em> is a pattern that matches a
connecting client. It can be:</p>



<ul><li>An IP address in dotted-quad notation (e.g., 192.168.10.1).</p></li><li>A hostname (DNS, or whatever naming services the host is using).</p></li><li>An IP network as
network-number/<a name="INDEX-1500" />mask (e.g., 192.168.10.0/255.255.255;
note that the "/n-mask-bits" syntax, 192.168.10.0/24,
isn't recognized).</p></li><li>"ALL", matching any client source address.</p></li></ul>
<a href="ch09_04.html#ch09-29132">Example 9-1</a> shows a sample
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.allow</em> configuration. This setup
allows connections to any service from the local host's
loopback address, and from all addresses 192.168.10.x. This host is
running publicly available servers for SSH1, POP, and IMAP, so we
allow connections to these from anywhere, but SSH-2 clients are
restricted to sources in another particular range of networks.</p>



<a name="ch09-29132" /><div class="example">
<a name="INDEX-1501" /><h4 class="objtitle">Example 9-1. Sample /etc/hosts.allow File</h4>


<blockquote><pre class="code">#

</div>



We allow connections to the forwarded port 1234 from a particular
host, <em class="emphasis">blynken.sleepy.net</em>.
Note that this host doesn't have to be on any of the networks
listed so far but can be anywhere at all. The rules so far say what
is allowed, but don't by themselves forbid any connections. So
for example, the forwarding established by the command <tt class="command">ssh1
-L1234:localhost:21 remote</tt> is accessible only to the local
host, since SSH1 defaults to binding only the loopback address in any
case. But <tt class="command">ssh1 -g -L1234:localhost:21 remote</tt> is
accessible to <em class="emphasis">blynken.sleepy.net</em> as well, as is either
command using <tt class="command">ssh2</tt> instead (since
<tt class="command">ssh2</tt> doesn't affect the localhost
restriction and ignores the <span class="option">-g</span> option). The
important difference is that with this use of TCP-wrappers,
<tt class="command">sshd</tt> rejects connections to the forwarded port,
1234, from any other address.</p>



The <tt class="literal">sshdfwd-x11</tt> line restricts X-forwarding
connections to the local host. This means that if
<tt class="command">ssh</tt> connects to this host with X forwarding, only
local X clients can use the forwarded X connection. X authentication
does this already, but this configuration provides an extra bit of
protection.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-127">[127]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">


<a name="FOOTNOTE-127" />[127]SSH2 2.1.0 has a bug that causes an SSH
session to freeze after it rejects a forwarded connection because of
a TCP-wrappers rule, at least on some Unix systems. Until this bug is
fixed, don't use TCP-wrappers for protecting forwarded ports
(although using it to restrict access to the main <tt class="command">sshd2
</tt>server appears to work).</p>


</blockquote>



The final line denies any connection that doesn't match the
earlier lines, making this a default-to-closed configuration. If you
wanted instead to deny some particular connections but allow all
others, you would use something like this:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : evil.mordor.net : DENY
telnetd : completely.horked.edu : DENY
ALL : ALL : ALLOW</pre></blockquote>



The final line is technically not required, but it's a good
idea to make your intentions explicit. If you don't have the
<em class="emphasis">host_options</em> syntax available, you instead have
an empty <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file and the following
lines in <em class="filename">hosts.deny </em>:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : evil.mordor.net
telnetd : completely.horked.edu</pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">9.4.2. Notes About TCP-wrappers</h3>



Here are a few things to remember when using TCP-wrappers:</p>



<ul><li>You can't distinguish between ports forwarded by SSH1 and SSH2:
the <tt class="literal">sshdfwd-*</tt> rules refer to both simultaneously.
You can work around this limitation by linking each against a
different <em class="emphasis">libwrap.a</em>, compiled with different
filenames for the allow and deny files, or by patching the
<tt class="command">ssh</tt> and <tt class="command">sshd</tt> executables
directly, but then you have to keep track of these changes and extra
files.</p></li><li>The big drawback to TCP-wrappers is that it affects all users
simultaneously. An individual user can't specify custom access
rules for himself; there's just the single set of global
configuration files for the machine. This limits its usefulness on
multiuser machines.</p></li><li>If you compile
SSH with the <tt class="literal"> -- with-libwrap</tt> option, it is
automatically and always turned on; there's no configuration or
command-line option to disable the TCP-wrappers check. Remember that
SSH does this check not only for forwarded ports and X connections
but for connections to the main SSH server. As soon as you install a
version of <tt class="command">sshd</tt> with TCP-wrappers, you must ensure
that the TCP-wrappers configuration allows connections to the server,
for instance with the rule <tt class="literal">sshd1 sshd2</tt>
<tt class="literal">sshd</tt> <tt class="literal">:</tt> <tt class="literal">ALL</tt>
in
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts.allow.</em><a name="INDEX-1502" /></p></li><li>Using hostnames instead of addresses in the TCP-wrappers rule set
involves the usual security tradeoff. Names are more convenient, and
their use avoids breakage in the future if a host address changes. On
the other hand, an attacker can potentially subvert the naming
service and circumvent the access control. If the host machine is
configured to use only its <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> file for
name lookup, this may be acceptable even in a highly secure
environment.</p></li><li>The TCP-wrappers package includes a program called
<tt class="command">tcpdchk</tt><a name="INDEX-1503" />.
This program examines the wrapper control files and reports
inconsistencies that might signal problems. Many sites run this
periodically as a safety check. Unfortunately,
<tt class="command">tcpdchk</tt> is written only with explicit wrapping via
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> in mind. It doesn't have any
way of knowing about programs that refer to the control files via the
<em class="emphasis">libwrap</em> routines, as does
<tt class="command">sshd</tt>. When <tt class="command">tcpdchk</tt> reads
control files with SSH rules, it finds uses of the service names
sshd1, sshdfwd-<em class="replaceable">n</em>, etc., but no
corresponding wrapped services in <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em>,
and it generates a warning. Unfortunately, we know of no workaround.
