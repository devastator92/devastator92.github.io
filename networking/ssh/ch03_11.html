<h2 class="sect1">3.11. Threats SSH Doesn't Prevent</h2>



<a name="INDEX-488" />SSH isn't a total security solution.
We'll now present some examples of attacks that SSH
wasn't designed to prevent.</p>



<a name="ch03-40-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.11.1. Password Cracking</h3>



SSH dramatically improves
<a name="INDEX-489" />password
security by encrypting your password as it passes over the network.
Nevertheless, a password is still a weak form of authentication, and
you must take care with it. You must choose a good password,
memorable to you but not obvious to anyone else, and not easily
guessable. You must also avoid having your password stolen, since
possession alone is sufficient to grant access to your account. So
watch out: the guy at the next terminal might be surreptitiously
"shoulder-surfing" (watching as you type). That computer
kiosk you're about to use may have been tricked up to log all
keystrokes to Cracker Central Command. And the nice-sounding fellow
who calls from Corporate IT and asks for your password to "fix
your account" might not be who he claims.</p>



Consider public-key authentication instead, since it is
<em class="emphasis">two-factor</em> : a stolen passphrase is useless
without the private key file, so an attacker needs to steal both. Of
course, the SSH client on the computer you're borrowing can be
rigged to squirrel away your key after you blithely supply your
passphrase to decrypt it. If you're that worried, you
shouldn't use strange computers. In the future, one hopes,
cryptographic smartcards and readers will be ubiquitous and supported
by SSH, so that you can carry your keys conveniently and use them in
other computers without fear of disclosure.</p>



If you must use password authentication because of its convenience,
consider using a one-time password scheme such as S/Key to reduce
risk. [<a href="ch03_04.html#ch03-30873">Section 3.4.2.5, "One-time passwords"</a>]</p>
</div>








<a name="ch03-41-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.11.2. IP and TCP Attacks</h3>



<a name="INDEX-490" />SSH
operates on top of TCP, so it is vulnerable to some attacks against
weaknesses in TCP and IP. The privacy, integrity, and authentication
guarantees of SSH limit this vulnerability to
<a name="INDEX-491" />denial-of-service attacks.</p>



TCP/IP is resistant to network problems such as congestion and link
failure. If the enemy blows up a router, IP can route around it. It
wasn't designed to resist an adversary injecting bogus packets
into the network, however. The origin of TCP or IP control messages
isn't authenticated. As a result, TCP/IP has a number of
inherent exploitable weaknesses, such as:</p>



<dl>
<dt><i>SYN flood</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-492" />SYN stands
for "synchronize," and is a TCP packet attribute. In this
case, it refers to the initial packet sent to start the setup of a
TCP connection. This packet often causes the receiver to expend
resources preparing for the coming connection. If an attacker sends
large numbers of these packets, the receiving TCP stack may run out
of space and be unable to accept legitimate connections.</p></dd>



<dt><i>TCP RST, bogus ICMP</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-493" />Another TCP packet type is RST, for
"reset." Either side of a TCP connection can send an RST
packet at any time, which causes immediate teardown of the
connection. RST packets may be injected easily into a network,
immediately disconnecting any target TCP connection.</p>


Similarly, there is <a name="INDEX-494" />ICMP, the Internet Control Message
Protocol. ICMP allows IP hosts and routers to communicate information
about network conditions and host reachability. But again, there is
no authentication, so that injecting bogus ICMP packets can have
drastic effects. For instance, there are ICMP messages that say a
particular host or TCP port is unreachable; forging such packets can
cause connections to be torn down. There are also ICMP messages that
communicate routing information (redirects and router discovery);
forging such messages can cause sensitive data to be routed through
unintended and possibly compromised systems.</p></dd>



<dt><i>TCP desynchronization and hijacking</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-495" />By clever manipulation of the TCP
protocol, an attacker can desynchronize two sides of a TCP connection
with respect to data byte sequence numbers. In this state, it is
possible to inject packets that are accepted as a legitimate part of
the connection, allowing the attacker to insert arbitrary information
into the TCP data stream.</p></dd>

</dl>



SSH provides no protection against attacks that break or prevent
setup of TCP connections. On the other hand, SSH's encryption
and host authentication are effective against attacks that involve
inappropriate routing that would otherwise permit reading of
sensitive traffic or redirect a connection to a compromised server.
Likewise, attacks that hijack or alter TCP data will fail, because
SSH detects them, but they also break the SSH connection, because SSH
responds to such problems by termination.</p>



Because these threats focus on problems with TCP/IP, they can be
effectively countered only by lower, network-level techniques, such
as hardware link encryption or IPSEC. [<a href="ch01_06.html#ch01-95065">Section 1.6.4, "IPSEC"</a>]
IPSEC is the IP Security protocol that is part of the next-generation
IP protocol, IPv6, and available as an add-on to the current IP
standard, IPv4. It provides encryption, integrity, and data
origin-authentication services at the IP packet level.</p>

<a name="ch03-42-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.11.3. Traffic Analysis</h3>



Even if an attacker can't read your network
<a name="INDEX-496" />traffic, he can glean a great deal of
useful information by simply watching it -- noting the amount of
data, the source and destination addresses, and timing. A sudden
increase in traffic with another company might tip him off that an
impending business deal is in the works. Traffic patterns can also
indicate backup schedules or times of day most vulnerable to
denial-of-service attacks. Prolonged silence on an SSH connection
from a sysadmin's desktop might indicate that she's
stepped out, and that now is a good time to break in, electronically
or physically.</p>



SSH doesn't address traffic-analysis attacks. SSH connections
are easily identifiable as they generally go to a well-known port,
and the SSH protocol makes no attempt to obfuscate traffic analysis.
An SSH implementation could conceivably send random, no-op traffic
over a connection when it's otherwise idle, to frustrate
activity correlation, but we know of no SSH package with this
feature.</p>

<a name="ch03-43-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.11.4. Covert Channels</h3>



A <em class="emphasis">covert channel</em><a name="INDEX-497" /> is a means of signaling information in
an unanticipated and unnoticed fashion. Suppose that one day,
Sysadmin Sally decides her users are having too much fun, and she
turns off email and instant messaging so they can't chat. To
get around this, you and your friend agree to put messages to each
other into world-readable files in your home directories, which
you'll check every once a while for new messages. This
unanticipated communication mechanism is a covert channel.</p>



Covert channels are hard to eliminate. If Sysadmin Sally discovers
your file-based technique, she can make all home directories
unreadable and unsearchable by anyone but their owners, and prevent
the owners from changing this restriction. While she's at it,
she can also make sure you can't create files anywhere else,
like <em class="filename">/tmp</em>. (Most of your programs don't
work now, but that doesn't matter to Sally.) Even so, you and
your friend can still list each other's home directory nodes
themselves, which reveals the directory modification date and number
of files, so you devise a secret code based on these visible
parameters and communicate by modifying them. This is a more complex
covert channel, and you can imagine even more outlandish ones in the
face of further restrictions from Sally.</p>



SSH doesn't attempt to eliminate covert channels. Their
analysis and control are generally part of highly secure computer
systems, such as those designed to handle information safely at
various security classification levels within the same system.
Incidentally, the SSH data stream itself can be used perfectly well
as a covert channel: the encrypted contents of your SSH session might
be a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, while a secret message about
an impending corporate merger is represented in Morse code using
even/odd packet lengths for dashes and dots.</p>

<a name="ch03-44-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.11.5. Carelessness</h3>



<p><em>Mit der Dummheit k&auml;mpfen G&ouml;tter selbst
vergebens.
<br>
(Against stupidity, even the Gods struggle in vain.)</em>
<p>
 -- Friedrich von Schiller
<p>



Security tools don't secure anything; they only help people to
do so. It's almost a clich&eacute;, but so important that it
bears any amount of repeating. The best cryptography or most secure
protocols in the world won't help if users pick bad passwords,
or write their passphrases on Post-it notes stuck to the undersides
of their keyboards. They also won't help sysadmins who neglect
other aspects of host security, allowing host-key theft or
wiretapping of terminal sessions.</p>



As Bruce Schneier is fond of saying, "Security is a process,
not a product." SSH is a good tool, but it must be part of an
overall and ongoing process of security awareness. Other aspects of
host integrity must still be attended to; security advisories for
relevant software and operating systems monitored, appropriate
patches or workarounds applied promptly, and people educated and kept
aware of their security responsibilities. Don't just install
SSH and think that you're now secure; you're
not.<a name="INDEX-498" /></p>
