One of SSH's major benefits is
<em class="emphasis">transparency</em><a name="INDEX-1348" /></a>.
A terminal session secured by SSH behaves like an ordinary, insecure
one (e.g., created by <em class="filename">telnet</em> or
<tt class="command">rsh</tt>) once it has been established. Behind the
scenes, however, SSH keeps the session secure via strong
authentication, encryption, and integrity checking.<p></p>



In some situations, however, transparency is hard to achieve. A
network firewall might be in the way, interfering with certain
network traffic you need. Corporate security policies might prohibit
you from storing SSH keys on certain machines. Or you might need to
use insecure network applications in an otherwise secure environment.<p></p>



In this chapter, we'll discuss an important feature of SSH,
called <em class="emphasis">forwarding</em> or
<em class="emphasis">tunneling</em>, that addresses several concerns about
transparency:<p></p>



<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Securing other TCP/IP applications</em></i></dt>
<dd>SSH can transparently encrypt another application's data
stream. This is called <em class="emphasis">port
forwarding</em><a name="INDEX-1349" /></a>.<p></p></dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Securing X window applications</em> </i></dt>
<dd>Using SSH, you can invoke X programs on a remote machine and have
them appear, securely, on your local display. (This feature of X is
insecure ordinarily.) This is called <em class="emphasis">X
forwarding</em><a name="INDEX-1350" /></a>, a special case of port forwarding
for which SSH has extra support.<p></p></dd>

</dl>



SSH forwarding isn't completely transparent, since it occurs at
the application level, not the network level. Applications must be
configured to participate in forwarding, and a few protocols are
problematic to forward (FTP data channels are a notable example). But
in most common situations, once a secure tunnel is set up, the
participating applications appear to the user to operate normally.
For complete application-level transparency, you need a network-level
technique, such as IPSEC [<a href="ch01_06.html#ch01-95065">Section 1.6.4, "IPSEC"</a>] or a
proprietary <a name="INDEX-1351" /></a>VPN (Virtual Private Network)
technology available from various vendors, in host software or
dedicated routers. While VPNs provide a more complete solution, they
require significantly more work and expense to set up compared to SSH
forwarding.<p></p>



So, when we say "transparent" in this chapter, we mean
"transparent to the application, once a little configuration
has been done."<p></p>



<a name="ch09-3-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>WARNING: </b>
In this chapter, we discuss using SSH forwarding techniques to allow
otherwise prohibited traffic across firewalls. This can be a
perfectly legitimate and adequately safe practice if done properly:
the firewall prevents unauthorized traffic, while SSH forwarding
allows authorized users to bypass the restriction. However,
don't forget you are bypassing a security restriction that is
in place for a reason. Be sure to follow the guidelines we give for
safe SSH forwarding. Also, take care that you aren't violating
a company policy by using forwarding. Just because you
<em class="emphasis">can</em> do something doesn't automatically
mean that it's a good idea. If in doubt, consult with your
system administrators.<p></p>

<h2 class="sect1">9.1. What Is Forwarding?</h2>



<a name="INDEX-1352" /></a>Forwarding
is a type of interaction with another network application, as shown
in <a href="ch09_01.html#ch09-94384">Figure 9-1</a>. SSH intercepts a service request
from some other program on one side of an SSH connection, sends it
across the encrypted connection, and delivers it to the intended
recipient on the other side. This process is mostly transparent to
both sides of the connection: each believes it is talking directly to
its partner and has no knowledge that forwarding is taking place.
Even more powerfully, SSH forwarding can achieve certain types of
communication that are impossible without it.<p></p>



<a name="ch09-94384" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="156" alt="Figure 9-1" src="figs/ssh_0901.gif" width="336" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-1. SSH forwarding</h4>

Forwarding isn't a new concept. The basic operation of a
terminal connection over a network (say, using
<tt class="command">telnet</tt>) is also a kind of forwarding. In a
<em class="emphasis">telnet</em> connection, you sit on one end, your
remote shell is on the other, and both sides operate as if directly
connected by a serial cable. Nevertheless, sitting in the middle is a
cooperating <em class="emphasis">telnet</em> client and server, forwarding
bytes back and forth. SSH forwarding is much the same, except SSH
plays fancy tricks with the data to add security.<p></p>



We have also seen another type of SSH forwarding, agent forwarding.
[<a href="ch06_03.html#ch06-27937">Section 6.3.5, "Agent Forwarding"</a>] This let us create SSH connections from
one computer, through a second computer, and onto a third using
public-key authentication, but without installing our private key on
the second machine. To accomplish this, an SSH server pretended to be
an SSH agent, while transparently forwarding data to and from a
remote agent. This paradigm holds true for TCP port forwarding and X
forwarding, as the SSH server transparently masquerades as another
network application.<p></p>
