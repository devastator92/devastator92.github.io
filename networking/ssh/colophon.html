<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>






Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p><p>


The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">SSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive
Guide</em> is a land snail (<em class="emphasis">Mollusca gastropoda</em>).</p><p>


A member of the mollusk family, a snail has a soft, moist body
that is protected by a hard shell, into which it can retreat when in
danger or when in arid or bright conditions. Snails prefer wet weather
and, though not nocturnal, will stay out of bright sun. At the front
of a snail's long body are two sets of tentacles: its eyes are at the
end of one set, and the other set is used for smelling and
navigation.</p><p>


Land snails are hermaphrodites, each having both female and male
sex organs, though a snail must mate with another snail in order for
fertilization to occur. A snail lays eggs approximately six times a
year, with almost 100 eggs each time. Young snails hatch in a month
and become adults in two years. A snail's life span is approximately
5-10 years.</p><p>


Known as a slow mover, a snail moves by muscles on its underside
that contract and expand, propelling the snail along at a slow
pace. It leaves a wet trail of mucus, which protects the snail from
anything sharp it may need to crawl over as it searches for food. The
snail's diet of plants, bark, and fruits causes it to be a pest in
many parts of the world where it is notorious for destroying
crops.</p><p>


Mary Anne Weeks Mayo was the production editor and copyeditor
for <em class="citetitle">SSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</em>. Colleen Gorman
proofread the book. Rachel Wheeler and Jane Ellin provided quality
control. Matt Hutchinson and Lucy Muellner provided production
assistance. John Bickelhaupt revised the index.</p><p>


Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a
series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is an original
engraving from the book <em class="emphasis">Natural History of Animals</em> by Sanborn Tenney
and Abby A. Tenney, published by Scribner, Armstrong &amp; Co. in
1873. Emma Colby produced the cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1
using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p><p>

 
David Futato and Melanie Wang designed the interior layout based on a series design by Nancy Priest. Mike Sierra implemented the design in FrameMaker 5.5.6. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book; the code font is Constant Willison. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano using Macromedia FreeHand 8 and Adobe Photoshop 5. This colophon was written by Nicole Arigo.</p><p>
