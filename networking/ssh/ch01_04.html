<h2 class="sect1">1.4. Overview of SSH Features</h2>



So, what can SSH do? Let's run through some examples that
demonstrate the major features of SSH, such as secure remote logins,
secure file copying, and secure invocation of remote commands. We use
SSH1 in the examples, but all are possible with OpenSSH, SSH2, and
F-Secure SSH.</p>



<a name="ch01-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.1. Secure Remote Logins</h3>



<a name="INDEX-57" /><a name="INDEX-58" />Suppose
you have accounts on several computers on the Internet. Typically,
you connect from a home PC to your ISP, and then use a
<tt class="command">telnet</tt><a name="INDEX-59" /> program to log into your accounts on other
computers. Unfortunately, <tt class="command">telnet</tt> transmits your
username and password in plaintext over the Internet, where a
malicious third party can intercept them.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a> Additionally, your entire
<tt class="command">telnet</tt> session is readable by a network snooper.</p><blockquote class="footnote">


<a name="FOOTNOTE-3" />[3]This is
true of standard Telnet, but some implementations add security
features.</p>


</blockquote>



<a name="ch01-5-fm2xml" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Terminology: Networking</h4>

<dt><i>~ or $HOME</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-60" />A user's home directory on a Unix machine, particularly when

shells recognize ~ as a user's home directory, with the notable
exception of Bourne shell. $HOME is recognized by all shells.</p></dd>

</dl>


</td></tr></table><p></blockquote>

SSH completely avoids these problems. Rather than running the
insecure <tt class="command">telnet</tt> program, you run the SSH client
program <tt class="command">ssh</tt>. To log into an account with the
username smith on the remote computer <em class="emphasis">host.example.com</em>, use this command:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -l smith host.example.com</pre></blockquote>



The client authenticates you to the remote computer's SSH
server using an encrypted connection, meaning that your username and
password are encrypted before they leave the local machine. The SSH
server then logs you in, and your entire login session is encrypted
as it travels between client and server. Because the encryption is
transparent, you won't notice any differences between
<tt class="command">telnet</tt> and the <tt class="command">telnet</tt>-like SSH
client.</p>

<a name="ch01-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.2. Secure File Transfer</h3>



<a name="INDEX-61" />Suppose
you have <a name="INDEX-62" />accounts
on two Internet computers, <em class="emphasis">me@firstaccount.com</em> and <em class="emphasis">metoo@secondaccount.com</em>, and you want to
transfer a file from the first to the second account. The file
contains trade secrets about your business, however, that must be
kept from prying eyes. A traditional file-transfer program, such as
<tt class="command">ftp</tt>, <tt class="command">rcp</tt>, or even email,
doesn't provide a secure solution. A third party can intercept
and read the packets as they travel over the network. To get around
this problem, you can encrypt the file on <em class="emphasis">firstaccount.com</em> with a program such as
<a name="INDEX-63" />Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), transfer it
via traditional means, and decrypt the file on <em class="emphasis">secondaccount.com</em>, but such a process is
tedious and nontransparent to the user.</p>



Using SSH, the file can be transferred securely between machines with
a single secure copy command. If the file were named
<em class="filename">myfile</em>, the command executed on <em class="emphasis">firstaccount.com</em> might be:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ scp myfile metoo@secondaccount.com:</pre></blockquote>



When transmitted by <a name="INDEX-64" /><tt class="command">scp</tt>, the file is
automatically encrypted as it leaves <em class="emphasis">firstaccount.com</em> and decrypted as it
arrives on <em class="emphasis">secondaccount.com</em>.</p>
</div>








<a name="ch01-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.3. Secure Remote Command Execution</h3>



Suppose <a name="INDEX-65" />you are a system administrator who
needs to run the same command on many computers. You'd like to
view the active processes for each user on four different
computers -- <em class="emphasis">grape</em>,
<em class="emphasis">lemon</em>, <em class="emphasis">kiwi</em>, and <em class="emphasis">melon</em> -- on a local area network
using the Unix command <em class="filename">/usr/ucb/w</em>.
Traditionally, one could use
<tt class="command">rsh</tt><a name="INDEX-66" />, assuming that the
<tt class="command">rsh</tt> daemon,
<tt class="command">rshd</tt><a name="INDEX-67" />,
is configured properly on the remote computers:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/bin/sh                      <i class="lineannotation">This is a shell script.</i>
for machine in grape lemon kiwi melon          <i class="lineannotation">On each of these four machines in turn...</i>
do                                             
  rsh $machine /usr/ucb/w                      <i class="lineannotation">invoke the "/usr/ucb/w" program, which</i>
done                                           <i class="lineannotation">prints a list of all running processes.</i></pre></blockquote>



Although this method works, it's insecure. The results of
<em class="filename">/usr/ucb/w</em> are transmitted as
plaintext across the network; if you consider this information
sensitive, the risk might be unacceptable. Worse, the
<tt class="command">rsh</tt> authentication mechanism is extremely insecure
and easily subverted. Using the <tt class="command">ssh</tt> command
instead, you have:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/bin/sh
for machine in grape lemon kiwi melon
do
  ssh $machine /usr/ucb/w                       <i class="lineannotation">Note "ssh" instead of "rsh"</i>
done</pre></blockquote>



The syntax is nearly identical, and the visible output is identical,
but under the hood, the command and its results are encrypted as they
travel across the network, and strong authentication techniques may
be used when connecting to the remote machines.</p>
</div>








<a name="ch01-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.4. Keys and Agents</h3>



Suppose you have accounts on many computers on a network. For
security reasons, you prefer different passwords on all accounts; but
remembering so many passwords is difficult. It's also a
security problem in itself. The more often you type a password, the
more likely you'll mistakenly type it in the wrong place. (Have
you ever accidently typed your password instead of your username,
visible to the world? Ouch! And on many systems, such mistakes are
recorded in a system log file, revealing your password in plaintext.)
Wouldn't it be great to identify yourself only once and get
secure access to all the accounts without continually typing
passwords?</p>



SSH has various authentication mechanisms, and the most secure is
based on <em class="emphasis">keys</em> rather than passwords. Keys are
discussed in great detail in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Key Management and Agents"</a>, but for
now we define a <a name="INDEX-68" />key as a small blob of bits
that uniquely identifies an SSH user. For security, a key is kept
encrypted; it may be used only after entering a secret
<em class="emphasis">passphrase</em> to decrypt it.</p>



Using keys, together with a program called an
<em class="emphasis">authentication
agent</em><a name="INDEX-69" />, SSH can authenticate you to all your
computer accounts securely without requiring you to memorize many
passwords or enter them repeatedly. It works like this:</p>



<ol><li>In advance (and only once), place special files called
<em class="emphasis">public key files</em> into your remote computer
accounts. These enable your SSH clients (<tt class="command">ssh</tt>,
<tt class="command">scp</tt>) to access your remote accounts.</p></li><li>On your local machine, invoke the <tt class="command">ssh-agent</tt>
program, which runs in the background.</p></li><li>Choose the key (or keys) you will need during your login session.</p></li><li>Load the keys into the agent with the <tt class="command">ssh-add</tt>
program. This requires knowledge of each key's secret
passphrase.</p></li></ol>
At this point, you have an <tt class="command">ssh-agent</tt> program
running on your local machine, holding your secret keys in memory.
You're now done. You have password-less access to all your
remote accounts that contain your public key files. Say goodbye to
the tedium of retyping passwords! The setup lasts until you log out
from the local machine or terminate <tt class="command">ssh-agent</tt>.</p>
</div>








<a name="ch01-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.5. Access Control</h3>



Suppose you want to permit another person to use your computer
account, but only for certain purposes. For example, while
you're out of town you'd like your secretary to read your
email but not to do anything else in your account. With SSH, you can
give your secretary access to your account without revealing or
changing your password, and with only the ability to run the email
program. No system-administrator privileges are required to set up
this restricted access. (This topic is the focus of <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Per-Account Server Configuration"</a>.)</p>
</div>








<a name="ch01-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.6. Port Forwarding</h3>



SSH <a name="INDEX-70" />can
increase the security of other TCP/IP-based applications such as
<tt class="command">telnet</tt>, <tt class="command">ftp</tt>, and the X Window
System. A technique called <em class="emphasis">port forwarding</em> or
<em class="emphasis">tunneling</em><a name="INDEX-71" />
reroutes a TCP/IP connection to pass through an SSH connection,
transparently encrypting it end-to-end. Port forwarding can also pass
such applications through network firewalls that otherwise prevent
their use.</p>



Suppose you are logged into a machine away from work and want to
access the internal news <a name="INDEX-72" />server at your office, <em class="emphasis">news.yoyodyne.com</em>. The Yoyodyne network
is connected to the Internet, but a network firewall blocks incoming
connections to most ports, particularly port 119, the news port. The
firewall does allow incoming SSH connections, however, since the SSH
protocol is secure enough that even Yoyodyne's rabidly paranoid
system administrators trust it. SSH can establish a secure tunnel on
an arbitrary local TCP port -- say, port 3002 -- to the news
port on the remote host. The command might look a bit cryptic at this
early stage, but here it is:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -L 3002:localhost:119 news.yoyodyne.com</pre></blockquote>



This says "<tt class="command">ssh</tt>, please establish a secure
connection from TCP port 3002 on my local machine to TCP port 119,
the news port, on <em class="emphasis">news.yoyodyne.com</em>." So, in order
to read news securely, configure your news-reading program to connect
to port 3002 on your local machine. The secure tunnel created by
<tt class="command">ssh</tt> automatically communicates with the news
server on <em class="emphasis">news.yoyodyne.com</em>,
and the news traffic passing through the tunnel is protected by
encryption. [<a href="ch09_01.html#ch09-31407">Section 9.1, "What Is Forwarding?"</a>]</p>
