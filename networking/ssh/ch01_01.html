<a name="INDEX-43" /></a>Many people today have multiple
computer accounts. If you're a reasonably savvy user, you might
have a personal account with an Internet service provider (ISP), a
work account on your employer's local network, and one or more
PCs at home. You might also have permission to use other accounts
owned by family members or friends.<p></p>



If you have multiple accounts, it's natural to want to make
connections between them. For instance, you might want to copy files
between computers over a network, log into one account remotely from
another, or transmit commands to a remote computer for execution.
Various programs exist for these purposes, such as
<tt class="command">ftp</tt> and <span class="option">rcp</span> for file transfers,
<tt class="command">telnet</tt> and <tt class="command">rlogin</tt> for remote
logins, and <tt class="command">rsh</tt> for remote execution of commands.<p></p>



Unfortunately, many of these <a name="INDEX-44" /></a>network-related
programs have a fundamental problem: they lack
security<em class="emphasis">.</em> If you transmit a sensitive file via
the Internet, an intruder can potentially intercept and read the
data. Even worse, if you log onto another computer remotely using a
program such as <em class="emphasis">telnet</em>, your username and
password can be intercepted as they travel over the network. Yikes!<p></p>



How can these serious problems be prevented? You can use an
<em class="emphasis">encryption
program</em><a name="INDEX-45" /></a> to scramble your
data into a secret code nobody else can read. You can install a
<em class="emphasis">firewall,</em><a name="INDEX-46" /></a>
a device that shields portions of a computer network from intruders.
Or you can use a wide range of other solutions, alone or combined,
with varying complexity and cost.<p></p>

<h2 class="sect1">1.1. What Is SSH?</h2>



SSH, the Secure Shell, is a popular, powerful, software-based
approach to network security.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>
Whenever data is sent by a computer to the network, SSH automatically
encrypts it. When the data reaches its intended recipient, SSH
automatically decrypts (unscrambles) it. The result is
<em class="emphasis">transparent</em> encryption: users can work normally,
unaware that their communications are safely encrypted on the
network. In addition, SSH uses modern, secure encryption algorithms
and is effective enough to be found within mission-critical
applications at major corporations.<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">


<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /></a>[1]"SSH" is
pronounced by spelling it aloud: S-S-H. You might find the name
"Secure Shell" a little puzzling, because it is not, in
fact, a shell at all. The name was coined from the existing
<tt class="command">rsh </tt>utility, a ubiquitous Unix program that also
provides remote logins but is very insecure.<p></p>


</blockquote>



SSH has a client/server <a name="INDEX-47" /></a><a name="INDEX-48" /></a>architecture,
as shown in <a href="ch01_01.html#ch01-75170">Figure 1-1</a>. An SSH
<em class="emphasis">server</em> program, typically installed and run by a
system administrator, accepts or rejects incoming connections to its
host computer. Users then run SSH <em class="emphasis">client</em>
programs, typically on other computers, to make requests of the SSH
server, such as "Please log me in," "Please send me
a file," or "Please execute this command." All
communications between clients and servers are securely encrypted and
protected from modification.<p></p>



<a name="ch01-75170" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="502" alt="Figure 1-1" src="figs/ssh_0101.gif" width="482" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 1-1. SSH architecture</h4>

Our description is simplified but should give you a general idea of
what SSH does. We'll go into depth later. For now, just
remember that SSH clients communicate with SSH servers over encrypted
network connections.<p></p>



An SSH-based product might include clients, servers, or both. Unix
products generally contain both clients and servers; those on other
platforms are usually just clients, though Windows-based servers are
beginning to appear.<p></p>



If you're a Unix user, think of SSH as a secure form of the
Unix r-commands: <tt class="command">rsh</tt> (remote shell),
<tt class="command">rlogin</tt> (remote login), and <tt class="command">rcp</tt>
(remote copy). In fact, the original SSH for Unix includes the
similarly named commands <tt class="command">ssh</tt>,
<tt class="command">scp</tt>, and <tt class="command">slogin</tt> as secure,
drop-in replacements for the r-commands. Yes, you can finally get rid
of those insecure <em class="filename">.rhosts</em> and
<em class="filename">hosts.equiv</em> files! (Though SSH can work with
them as well, if you like.) If you're still using the
r-commands, switch to SSH immediately: the learning curve is small,
and security is far better.<p></p>
