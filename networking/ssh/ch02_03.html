<h2 class="sect1">2.3. Adding Complexity to the Example</h2>



The preceding example session provided a quick introduction to the
most often-used client programs -- <tt class="command">ssh</tt> and
<tt class="command">scp</tt> -- in a format to follow while sitting at
your computer. Now that you have the basics, let's continue the
example but include situations and complications glossed over the
<a name="INDEX-125" />
first time. These include the "known hosts" security
feature and the SSH escape character.</p>



<a name="ch02-3-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b>
If
you're following at the computer as you read, your SSH clients
might behave unexpectedly or differently from ours. As you will see
throughout the book, SSH implementations are highly customizable, by
both yourself and the system administrator, on either side of the
secure connection. Although this chapter describes common behaviors
of SSH programs based on their installation defaults, your system
might be set up differently.</p>


If commands don't work as you expect,
try adding the <span class="option">-v</span> ("verbose")
command-line option, for example:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -v shell.isp.com</pre></blockquote>



This causes the client to print lots of information about its
progress, often revealing the source of the discrepancy.</p></blockquote>



<a name="ch02-49764" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.3.1. Known Hosts</h3>



The first time an SSH client encounters a new remote machine, it does
some extra work and prints a message like the following:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -l pat shell.isp.com
Host key not found from the list of known hosts.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</pre></blockquote>



Assuming you respond <tt class="literal">yes</tt> (the most common
response), the client continues:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">Host 'shell.isp.com' added to the list of known hosts.</pre></blockquote>



This message appears only the first time you contact a particular
remote host. The message is a security feature related to SSH's
concept of <em class="emphasis">known
hosts</em><a name="INDEX-126" /><a name="INDEX-127" />.</p>



Suppose an adversary wants to obtain your password. He knows you are
using SSH, and so he can't monitor your connection by
eavesdropping on the network. Instead, he subverts the naming service
used by your local host so that the name of your intended remote
host, <em class="emphasis">shell.isp.com</em>,
translates falsely to the IP address of a computer run by him! He
then installs an altered SSH server on the phony remote host and
waits. When you log in via your trusty SSH client, the altered SSH
server records your password for the adversary's later use (or
misuse, more likely). The bogus server can then disconnect with a
preplanned error message such as "System down for
maintenance -- please try again after 4:00 p.m." Even worse,
it can fool you completely by using your password to log into the
real <em class="emphasis">shell.isp.com</em> and
transparently pass information back and forth between you and the
server, monitoring your entire session. This hostile strategy is
called a
<a name="INDEX-128" /><a name="INDEX-129" />man-in-the-middle attack. [<a href="ch03_10.html#ch03-77405">Section 3.10.4, "Man-in-the-Middle Attacks"</a>] Unless you think to check the originating IP
address of your session on the server, you might never notice the
deception.</p>



The SSH <em class="emphasis">known-host
mechanism</em><a name="INDEX-130" /><a name="INDEX-131" /> prevents such attacks. When an SSH
client and <a name="INDEX-132" />server make a connection, each of
them proves its identity to the other. Yes, not only does the server
authenticate the client, as we saw earlier when the server checked
pat's password, but the client also authenticates the server by
public-key cryptography. [<a href="ch03_04.html#ch03-62629">Section 3.4.1, "Establishing the Secure Connection"</a>] In short, each
SSH server has a secret, unique ID, called a <em class="emphasis">host
key</em><a name="INDEX-133" />, to
identify itself to clients. The first time you connect to a remote
host, a public counterpart of the host key gets copied and stored in
your local account (assuming you responded "yes" to the
client's prompt about host keys, earlier). Each time you
reconnect to that remote host, the SSH client checks the remote
host's identity using this public key.</p>



Of course, it's better to have recorded the server's
public host key before connecting to it the first time, since
otherwise you are technically open to a man-in-the-middle attack that
first time. Administrators can maintain system-wide known-hosts lists
for given sets of hosts, but this doesn't do much good for
connecting to random new hosts around the world. Until a reliable,
widely deployed method of retrieving such keys securely exists (such
as secure DNS, or X.509-based public-key infrastructure), this
record-on-first-use mechanism is an acceptable compromise.</p>



If authentication of the server fails, various things may happen
depending on the reason for failure and the SSH configuration.
Typically a warning appears on the screen, ranging from a repeat of
the known-hosts message:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">Host key not found from the list of known hosts.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</pre></blockquote>



<a name="INDEX-134" />to more dire words:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!    @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the host key has just been changed.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in &lt;path&gt;/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Agent forwarding is disabled to avoid attacks by corrupted servers.
X11 forwarding is disabled to avoid attacks by corrupted servers.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)</pre></blockquote>



If you answer <tt class="literal">yes</tt>, <tt class="command">ssh</tt> allows
the connection, but disables various features as a security
precaution and doesn't update your personal known-hosts
database with the new key; you must do that yourself to make this
message go away.</p>



As the text of the message says, if you see this warning, you
aren't necessarily being hacked: for example, the remote host
may have legitimately changed its host key for some reason. In some
cases, even after reading this book, you won't know the cause
of these messages. Contact your system administrator if you need
assistance, rather than take a chance and possibly compromise your
password. We'll cover these issues further when we discuss
personal known hosts databases and how to alter the behavior of SSH
clients with respect to host keys. [<a href="ch07_04.html#ch07-11389">Section 7.4.3, "Host Keys and Known-Hosts Databases"</a>]</p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.3.2. The Escape Character</h3>



<a name="INDEX-135" />Let us
return to the <em class="emphasis">shell.isp.com</em>
example, just after you'd discovered the attachment in your
remote email message and saved it to the remote file
<em class="filename">print-me</em>. In our original example, you then
logged out of <em class="emphasis">shell.isp.com</em>
and ran <tt class="command">scp</tt> to transfer the file. But what if you
don't want to log out? If you're using a workstation
running a window system, you can open a new window and run
<tt class="command">scp</tt>. But if you're using a lowly text
terminal, or you're not familiar with the window system running
on your friend's computer, there is an alternative. You can
temporarily interrupt the SSH connection, transfer the file (and run
any other local commands you desire), and then resume the connection.</p>



<tt class="command">ssh</tt> supports an <em class="emphasis">escape
character,</em> a designated character that gets the attention
of the SSH client. Normally, <tt class="command">ssh</tt> sends every
character you type to the server, but the escape character is caught
by the client, alerting it that special commands may follow. By
default, the escape character is the tilde (<a name="INDEX-136" />~), but you
can change it. To reduce the chances of sending the escape character
unintentionally, that character must be the first character on the
command line, i.e., following a newline (<tt class="literal">Control-J</tt>) or return (<tt class="literal">Control-M</tt>) character. If not, the
client treats it literally, not as an escape character.</p>



After the escape character gets the client's attention, the
next character entered determines the effect of the escape. For
example, the escape character followed by a
<tt class="literal">Control-Z</tt> suspends <tt class="command">ssh</tt> like any
other shell job, returning control to the local shell. Such a pair of
characters is called an <em class="emphasis">escape
sequence.</em><a name="INDEX-137" /> <a href="ch02_03.html#ch02-24501">Table 2-1</a>
summarizes the supported escape sequences. It's followed by a
list that describes each sequence's meaning.</p>

<ul><li>"<a name="INDEX-138" />Suspend the
connection" puts <tt class="command">ssh</tt> into the background,
suspended, returning control of the terminal to the local shell. To
return to <tt class="command">ssh</tt>, use the appropriate job control
command of your shell, typically <tt class="command">fg</tt>. While
suspended, <tt class="command">ssh</tt> doesn't run, and if left
suspended long enough, the connection may terminate since the client
isn't responding to the server. Also, any
<a name="INDEX-139" />forwarded connections are
similarly blocked while <tt class="command">ssh</tt> is suspended. [<a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-87343">Section 9.2.9, "Termination"</a>]</p></li><li>"<a name="INDEX-140" />Terminate the connection" ends the SSH
session immediately. This is most useful if you have lost control of
the session: for instance, if a shell command on the remote host has
hung and become unkillable. Any X or TCP port forwardings are
terminated immediately as well. [<a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-87343">Section 9.2.9, "Termination"</a>]</p></li><li>"<a name="INDEX-141" /><a name="INDEX-142" /><a name="INDEX-143" />List all forwarded connections"
prints a list of each X forwarding or TCP port forwarding connection
currently established. This lists only active instances of
forwarding; if forwarding services are available but not currently in
use, nothing is listed here.</p></li><li>"Send ssh into the <a name="INDEX-144" />background," like the "suspend
connection" command, reconnects your terminal to the shell that
started <tt class="command">ssh</tt>, but it doesn't suspend the
<tt class="command">ssh</tt> process. Instead, <tt class="command">ssh</tt>
continues to run. This isn't ordinarily useful, since the
backgrounded <tt class="command">ssh</tt> process immediately encounters an
error.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> This escape sequence becomes
useful if your <tt class="command">ssh</tt> session has active, forwarded
connections when you log out. Normally in this situation, the client
prints a message:</p><blockquote class="footnote">


<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" />[7]The error occurs as <tt class="command">ssh
</tt>attempts to read input from the now disconnected
pseudo-terminal.</p>


</blockquote>
<blockquote><pre class="code">Waiting for forwarded connections to terminate...
The following connections are open:
X11 connection from shell.isp.com port 1996</pre></blockquote>

as it waits for the forwarded connections to close before it exits.
While the client is in this state, this escape sequence returns you
to the local shell prompt.</p></li>

<li><a name="INDEX-145" />"Request rekeying
immediately" causes the SSH2 client and server to generate and
use some new internal keys for encryption and integrity.</p></li><li>"<a name="INDEX-146" />Send the escape character"
tells the client to send a real tilde (or whatever the escape
character is) to the SSH server as plaintext, not to interpret it as
an escape. "Disable the escape character" prevents
further escape sequences from having any effect. The rest of the
escape sequences are self-explanatory.</p></li></ul>
To change the <tt class="command">ssh</tt> escape character, use the
<a name="INDEX-147" />-<em class="emphasis">e</em>
command-line option. For example, type the following to make the
percent sign (%) the escape character when connecting to <em class="emphasis">shell.isp.com</em> as user pat:</p>
