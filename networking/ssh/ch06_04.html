<h2 class="sect1">6.4. Multiple Identities</h2>



Until now, we've assumed you have a single SSH identity that
uniquely identifies you to an SSH server. You do have a default
identity -- our earlier <tt class="command">ssh-add</tt> examples
operated on it -- but you may create as many other identities as
you like.</p>



Why use several identities? After all, with a single SSH identity,
you can connect to remote machines with a single passphrase.
That's very simple and convenient. In fact, most people can
survive perfectly well with just one identity. Multiple identities
have important uses, however:</p>



<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Additional security</em> </i></dt>
<dd>If you use different SSH keys for different remote accounts, and one
of your keys is cracked, only some of your remote accounts will be
vulnerable.</p></dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Secure batch processes</em> </i></dt>
<dd>Using an SSH key with an empty passphrase, you can create secure,
automated processes between interacting computers, such as unattended
backups. [<a href="ch11_01.html#ch11-80380">Section 11.1.2.2, "Using a plaintext key"</a>] However, you definitely
don't want your regular logins to use an unencrypted private
key, so you should create a second key for this purpose.</p></dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Different account settings</em> </i></dt>
<dd>You can configure your remote account to respond differently based on
which key is used for connecting. For example, you can make your Unix
login session run different startup files depending on which key is
used.</p></dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Triggering remote programs</em> </i></dt>
<dd>Your remote account can be set up to run specific programs when an
alternative key is used, via forced commands. [<a href="ch08_02.html#ch08-22858">Section 8.2.4, "Forced Commands "</a>]</p></dd>

</dl>



In order to use multiple identities, you need to know how to switch
between them. There are two ways: manually, and automatically with an
agent.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">6.4.1. Switching Identities Manually</h3>



<em class="emphasis">ssh</em> and <em class="emphasis">scp</em> let you switch
your identity with the <span class="option">-i</span> command-line option and
the <tt class="literal">IdentityFile</tt> configuration keyword. For either
of these techniques, you provide the name of your desired private key
file (SSH1, OpenSSH) or identification file (SSH2). [<a href="ch07_04.html#ch07-80828">Section 7.4.2, "User Identity"</a>] <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-56012">Table 6-2</a> displays a

<a name="ch06-27-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.2. Switching Identities with an Agent</h3>



If you use an SSH agent, identity-switching is handled automatically.
Simply load all the desired identities into the agent using
<tt class="command">ssh-add</tt>. Thereafter, when you attempt a
connection, your SSH client requests and receives a list of all your
identities from the agent. The client then tries each identity in
turn until one authenticates successfully, or they all fail. Even if
you have 10 different identities for 10 different SSH servers, a
single agent (containing these keys) provides appropriate key
information to your SSH clients for seamless authentication with all
10 servers.</p>



All this happens transparently with no effort on your part. Well,
almost no effort. There are two potential problems that can strike if
you have two SSH identities that can connect to the same SSH server.</p>



The first problem occurs because the
<a name="INDEX-1125" />agent stores identities in the order in
which it receives them from <em class="emphasis">ssh-add</em>. As
we've said, the SSH client tries identities "in
turn," i.e., in the order it gets them from the agent.
Therefore, it is your responsibility to add identities to the agent
in a careful, useful order. Otherwise, if two or more identities
apply in a situation, an SSH client might authenticate with the wrong
one.</p>



For example, suppose you have two SSH1 identities stored in the files
<em class="filename">id-normal</em> and <em class="filename">id-backups</em>.
You use <em class="filename">id-normal</em> for normal terminal sessions
to <em class="emphasis">server.example.com</em> and
<em class="filename">id-backups</em> for invoking a remote backup program
on <em class="emphasis">server.example.com</em> (e.g.,
using a forced command [<a href="ch08_02.html#ch08-22858">Section 8.2.4, "Forced Commands "</a>]). Each day when
you log in, you load both keys into an agent, using a clever script
that locates and loads all key files in a given directory:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/bin/csh
cd ~/.ssh/my-keys						<i class="lineannotation"># An example directory</i></pre></blockquote>



<blockquote><pre class="code">foreach keyfile (*)
  ssh-add $keyfile
end</pre></blockquote>



What happens when you invoke an SSH client?</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh server.example.com</pre></blockquote>



In this case, the remote backup program gets run, authenticating with
the key in file <em class="filename">id-backups</em>. You see, the
wildcard in your script returns a list of key files in alphabetical
order, so <em class="filename">id-backups</em> is added before
<em class="filename">id-normal</em>, as if you'd typed:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh-add id-backups
$ ssh-add id-normal</pre></blockquote>



Therefore, your SSH clients will always use the key
<em class="emphasis">id-backups</em> when connecting to <em class="emphasis">server.example.com</em> because the agent
provides it first in response to a client request. This might not be
what you intended.</p>



The second problem only makes this behavior worse: identities in an
agent take precedence over identities used manually. If an identity
in the agent can successfully authenticate, there's no way to
override the agent manually with the <span class="option">-i</span> command-line
option or the <tt class="literal">IdentityFile</tt> keyword. So in the
earlier example, there is literally no way to use the identity
<em class="emphasis">id-normal</em>. The obvious attempt:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -i id-normal server.example.com</pre></blockquote>



still authenticates with <em class="emphasis">id-backup</em> s because it
is loaded first into the agent. Even nonloaded identities can't
override the agent's selection. For example, if you load only
one identity into the agent and try authenticating with the other:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh-add id-normal
$ ssh -i id-backups server.example.com</pre></blockquote>



your <tt class="command">ssh</tt> connection authenticates with the loaded
identity, in this case <em class="filename">id-normal</em>, regardless of
the <span class="option">-i</span> option.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-88">[88]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">


<a name="FOOTNOTE-88" />[88]This undocumented
behavior drove us insane until we figured out what was happening.
Similar behavior occurs with Kerberos authentication in SSH1. If you
have Kerberos credentials that allow you to connect, you aren't
running an agent, and you specify a key with <span class="option">-i</span>,
that key isn't used unless you destroy your Kerberos
credentials (or otherwise make them unusable, for instance, hiding
them by setting the KRB5CCNAME variable), because Kerberos is tried
first.</p>


</blockquote>



As a general rule, if you have two SSH identities valid on an SSH
server, don't load either identity into an agent. Otherwise,
one of those identities will be unable to access that server.</p>

<a name="ch06-28-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.3. Tailoring Sessions Based on Identity</h3>



Despite the gloom and doom in the previous section, multiple
identities can be extremely useful. In particular, you can configure
your remote accounts to respond differently to different identities.
This is a three-step process:</p>



<ol><li>Generate a new SSH identity, as we have discussed in this chapter.</p></li><li>Set up a detailed client configuration that does what you want, using
your new identity. This is the subject of <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Advanced Client Use"</a>.</p></li><li>Set up your account on the SSH server machine to respond to your new
identity in a desired manner. This is covered in detail in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Per-Account Server Configuration"</a>.</p></li></ol>
We strongly encourage you to experiment with this technique. You can
do some really powerful and interesting things with SSH this way. If
you're just running simple terminal sessions with SSH, you are
missing half the fun.</p>
