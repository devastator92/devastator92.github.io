<h2 class="sect1">11.3. Pine, IMAP, and SSH</h2>



<a name="INDEX-1656" />Pine is a
popular, Unix-based email program from the University of Washington
(<a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">http://www.washington.edu/pine/</a>). In addition to handling mail stored and delivered in
local files, Pine also supports IMAP<a href="#FOOTNOTE-136">[136]</a> for accessing remote
mailboxes and SMTP<a href="#FOOTNOTE-137">[137]</a> for posting mail.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

</blockquote>



In this case study, we integrate Pine and SSH to solve two common
problems:</p>



<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">IMAP authentication</em></i></dt>
<dd>In many cases, IMAP permits a password to be sent in the clear over
the network. We discuss how to protect your password using SSH, but
(surprisingly) not by port forwarding.</p></dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Restricted mail relaying</em></i></dt>
<dd>Many ISPs permit their mail and news servers to be accessed only by
their customers. In some circumstances, this restriction may prevent
you from legitimately relaying mail through your ISP. Once again, SSH
comes to the rescue.</p></dd>

</dl>



We also discuss wrapping <tt class="command">ssh</tt> in a script to avoid
Pine connection delays and facilitate access to multiple mailboxes.
This discussion will delve into more detail than the previous one on
Pine/SSH integration. [<a href="ch04_05.html#ch04-58541">Section 4.5.4, "Pine"</a>]</p>



<a name="ch11-27-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.3.1. Securing IMAP Authentication </h3>



<a name="INDEX-1657" />Like SSH, <a name="INDEX-1658" />IMAP is a
client/server protocol. Your email program (e.g., Pine) is the
client, and an IMAP server process (e.g., <tt class="command">imapd </tt>)
runs on a remote machine, the <em class="emphasis">IMAP host</em>, to
control access to your remote mailbox. Also like SSH, IMAP generally
requires you to authenticate before accessing your mailbox, typically
by password. Unfortunately, in many cases this password is sent to
the IMAP host in the clear over the network; this represents a
security risk (see <a href="ch11_03.html#ch11-70838">Figure 11-8</a>).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-138">[138]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">


<a name="FOOTNOTE-138" />[138]IMAP does support more secure methods of authentication, but
they aren't widely deployed.</p>

If you have an account on the IMAP host, and if it is running an SSH
server, you can protect your password. Because IMAP is a TCP/IP-based
protocol, one approach is to use SSH <a name="INDEX-1659" />port forwarding between the machine
running Pine and the IMAP host (see <a href="ch11_03.html#ch11-97657">Figure 11-9</a>).
[<a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-96388">Section 9.2.1, "Local Forwarding"</a>]</p>



<a name="ch11-97657" /><div class="figure"><img height="207" alt="Figure 11-9" src="figs/ssh_1109.gif" width="378" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 11-9. Forwarding an IMAP connection</h4>

However, this technique has two drawbacks:</p>



<dl>
<dt><i>Security risk</i></dt>
<dd>On a multiuser machine, any other user can connect to your forwarded
port. [<a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-31004">Section 9.2.4.3, "Listening on ("binding") an interface"</a>] If you use forwarding only to
protect your password, this isn't a big deal, since at worst,
an interloper could access a separate connection to the IMAP server
having nothing to do with your connection. On the other hand, if port
forwarding is permitting you to access an IMAP server behind a
firewall, an interloper can breach the firewall by hijacking your
forwarded port, a more serious security risk.</p></dd>



<dt><i>Inconvenience</i></dt>
<dd>In this setup, you must authenticate twice: first to the SSH server
on the IMAP host (to connect and to create the tunnel) and then to
the IMAP server by password (to access your mailbox). This is
redundant and annoying.</p></dd>

</dl>



Fortunately, we can address both these drawbacks and run Pine over
SSH securely and conveniently.</p>



<a name="ch11-28-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.1.1. Pine and preauthenticated IMAP</h3>



The IMAP protocol defines two modes in which an IMAP server can
start: normal and
<a name="INDEX-1660" />preauthenticated (see <a href="ch11_03.html#ch11-21854">Figure 11-10</a>). Normally, the server runs with special
privileges to access any user's mailbox, and hence it requires
authentication from the client. Unix-based IMAP servers enter this
mode when started as root.</p>



<a name="ch11-21854" /><div class="figure"><img height="209" alt="Figure 11-10" src="figs/ssh_1110.gif" width="409" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 11-10. Pine/IMAP over SSH, preauthenticated</h4>

Here's a sample session that invokes an IMAP server,
<tt class="command">imapd</tt>, through
<tt class="command">inetd</tt><a name="INDEX-1661" />
so it runs as root:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">server% telnet localhost imap
* OK localhost IMAP4rev1 v12.261 server ready
0 login res <em class="replaceable">password'</em>
1 select inbox
* 3 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 964209649] UID validity status
* OK [UIDNEXT 4] Predicted next UID
* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\* \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen)] Permanent flags
1 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed
2 logout
* BYE imap.example.com IMAP4rev1 server terminating connection
2 OK LOGOUT completed</pre></blockquote>



Alternatively, in preauthenticated mode, the IMAP server assumes that
authentication has already been done by the program that started the
server and that it already has the necessary rights to access the
user's mailbox. If you invoke <tt class="command">imapd</tt> on the
command line under a nonroot uid, <tt class="command">imapd</tt> assumes
you have already authenticated and opens your email inbox. You can
then type IMAP commands and access your mailbox without
authentication:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">server% /usr/local/sbin/imapd
* PREAUTH imap.example.com IMAP4rev1 v12.261 server ready
0 select inbox
* 3 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 964209649] UID validity status
* OK [UIDNEXT 4] Predicted next UID
* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\* \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen)] Permanent flags
0 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed
1 logout
* BYE imap.example.com IMAP4rev1 server terminating connection
1 OK LOGOUT completed</pre></blockquote>



Notice the <tt class="literal">PREAUTH</tt> response at the beginning of
the session, indicating pre-authenticated mode. It is followed by the
command <tt class="literal">select</tt> <tt class="literal">inbox</tt>, which
causes the IMAP server implicitly to open the inbox of the current
user without demanding authentication.</p>



Now, how does all this relate to Pine? When instructed to access an
IMAP mailbox, Pine first attempts to log into the IMAP host using
<tt class="command">rsh</tt> and to run a preauthenticated instance of
<tt class="command">imapd</tt> directly. If this succeeds, Pine then
converses with the IMAP server over the pipe to
<tt class="command">rsh</tt> and has automatic access to the user's
remote inbox without further authentication. This is a good idea and
very convenient; the only problem is that <tt class="command">rsh</tt> is
very insecure. However, you can make Pine use SSH instead.</p>
</div>





<a name="ch11-29-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.1.2. Making Pine use SSH instead of rsh</h3>



<a name="INDEX-1662" />Pine's
<em class="emphasis">rsh</em><a name="INDEX-1663" /> feature is
controlled by three configuration variables in the
<em class="filename">~/.pinerc</em><a name="INDEX-1664" /> file:
<tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt><a name="INDEX-1665" />,
<tt class="literal">rsh-command</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">rsh-open-timeout</tt>.
<tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> stores the program name for
opening a Unix remote shell connection. Normally it is the fully
qualified path to the <tt class="command">rsh</tt> executable (e.g.,
<em class="filename">/usr/ucb/rsh</em>). To make Pine use SSH, instruct it
to use the <tt class="command">ssh</tt> client rather than
<tt class="command">rsh</tt>, setting
<tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> to the location of the SSH
client:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">rsh-path=/usr/local/bin/ssh</pre></blockquote>



<tt class="literal">rsh-command</tt><a name="INDEX-1666" /> <a name="INDEX-1667" /> represents the Unix command
line for opening the remote shell connection: in this case, the IMAP
connection to the IMAP host. The value is a
<tt class="function">printf</tt>-style format string with four
"%s" conversion specifications that are automatically
filled in at runtime. From first to last, these four specifications
stand for:</p>



<ol><li>The value of <tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt></p></li><li>The remote hostname</p></li><li>The username for accessing your remote mailbox</p></li><li><p>The connection method; in this case, "imap"</p></li></ol>
For example, the default value of
<tt class="literal">rsh-command</tt>is:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">"%s %s -l %s exec /etc/r%sd"</pre></blockquote>



which can instantiate to:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">/usr/ucb/rsh imap.example.com -l smith exec /etc/rimapd</pre></blockquote>



To make this work properly with <tt class="command">ssh</tt>, modify the
default format string slightly, adding the <span class="option">-q</span> option
for quiet mode:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">rsh-command="%s %s -q -l %s exec /etc/r%sd"</pre></blockquote>



This instantiates to:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">/usr/local/bin/ssh imap.example.com -w -l smith exec /etc/rimapd</pre></blockquote>



The <span class="option">-q</span> option is necessary so that
<tt class="command">ssh</tt> doesn't emit diagnostic messages that
may confuse Pine, such as:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">Warning: Kerberos authentication disabled in SUID client.
fwd connect from localhost to local port sshdfwd-2001</pre></blockquote>



Pine otherwise tries to interpret these as part of the IMAP protocol.
The default IMAP server location of /<em class="emphasis">etc/r %sd</em>
becomes
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rimapd.</em></p>



The third variable, <tt class="literal">rsh-open-timeout</tt>, sets the number of seconds for Pine to open the remote shell
connection. Leave this setting at its default value, 15, but any
integer greater than or equal to 5 is permissible.</p>



So finally, the Pine configuration is:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">rsh-path=/usr/local/bin/ssh
rsh-command="%s %s -q -l %s exec /etc/r%sd"
rsh-open-timeout=</pre></blockquote>



<a name="ch11-30-fm2xml" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Remote Usernames in Pine</h4>



<a name="INDEX-1668" />By the way, it's not mentioned
in the Pine manpage or configuration file comments, but if you need
to specify a different username for connecting to a remote mailbox,
the syntax is:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">{hostname/user=jane}mailbox</pre></blockquote>



This causes Pine to call the
<tt class="literal">rsh-command</tt> with "jane"
as the remote username (i.e., the third %s substitution).</p>


</td></tr></table><p></blockquote>

Generally, you want to use an SSH authentication method that
doesn't require typing a password or passphrase, such as
trusted-host or public-key with an agent. SSH is run behind the
scenes by Pine and doesn't have access to the terminal to
prompt you. If you're running the X Window System,
<tt class="command">ssh</tt> can pop up an X widget instead to get input,
<tt class="command">ssh-askpass</tt>, but you probably don't want
that either. Pine may make several separate IMAP connections in the
course of reading your mail, even if it's all on the same
server. This is just how the IMAP protocol works.</p>



With the previous settings in your <em class="filename">~/.pinerc</em>
file and the right kind of SSH authentication in place, you're
ready to try Pine over SSH. Just start Pine and open your remote
mailbox; if all goes well, it will open without prompting for a
password.<a name="INDEX-1669" /></p>
</div>
</div>








<a name="ch11-51522" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.3.2. Mail Relaying and News Access</h3>



<a name="INDEX-1670" />Pine uses IMAP <a name="INDEX-1671" />to read mail but not to send it.
For that, it can either call a local program (such as
<tt class="command">sendmail </tt>) or use an SMTP server. Pine can also be
a newsreader and use NNTP (the Network News Transfer Protocol,
RFC-977) to contact a news server.</p>



An ISP commonly provides NNTP and SMTP servers for its customers when
connected to the ISP's network. However, for security and usage
control reasons, the ISP generally restricts this access to
connections originating within its own network (including its own
dial-up connections). In other words, if you're connected to
the Internet from elsewhere and try to use your ISP's services,
the attempt will probably fail. Access to your usual servers can be
blocked by a firewall, or if not, your outgoing mail can bounce with
a message about "no relaying," and the news server
rejects you with a message about "unauthorized use."</p>



You are authorized to use the services, of course, so what do you do?
Use SSH port forwarding! By forwarding your SMTP and NNTP connections
over an SSH session to a machine inside the ISP's network, your
connections appear to come from that machine, thus bypassing the
address-based restrictions. You can use separate SSH commands to
forward each port:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -L2025:localhost:25 smtp-server ...
$ ssh -L2119:localhost:119 nntp-server ...</pre></blockquote>



Alternatively, if you have a shell account on one of the ISP's
machines running SSH but can't log into the mail or news
servers directly, do this:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">$ ssh -L2025:smtp-server:25 -L2119:nntp-server:119 shell-server ...</pre></blockquote>



This is an off-host forwarding, and thus the last leg of the
forwarded path isn't protected by SSH. <a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-10068">Section 9.2.4, "Forwarding Off-Host"</a> But since the reason for this forwarding
isn't so much protection as it is bypassing the source-address
restriction, that's OK. Your mail messages and news postings
are going to be transferred insecurely once you drop them off,
anyway. (If you want security for them, you need to sign or encrypt
them separately, e.g., with PGP or S/MIME.)</p>



In any case, now configure Pine to use the forwarded ports by setting
the <tt class="literal">smtp-server</tt> and <tt class="literal">nntp-server</tt> configuration options in
your <em class="filename">~/.pinerc</em> file:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">smtp-server=localhost:2025
nntp-server=localhost:2119</pre></blockquote>
</div>








<a name="ch11-31-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.3.3. Using a Connection Script</h3>



The Pine configuration option <tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> can point not only to
<tt class="command">rsh</tt> or <tt class="command">ssh</tt>, but also to any
other program: most usefully, a script you've written providing
any needed customizations. There are a couple of reasons why you
might need to do this:</p>



<ul><li>The <tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> setting
is global, applying to every remote mailbox. That is, Pine tries to use this
style of access either for every remote mailbox or for none. If you
have multiple remote mailboxes but only some of them are accessible
via SSH/<tt class="command">imapd</tt>, this leads to annoyance. Pine falls
back to a direct TCP connection if SSH fails to get an IMAP
connection, but you have to wait for it to fail. If the server in
question is behind a firewall silently blocking the SSH port, this
can be a lengthy delay.</p></li>

<li>The "multiple forwarding" problem. You might think to add
forwarding options to Pine's
<tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> command, rather than run a
separate SSH session to get them:</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">rsh-command="%s %s -q -l %s -L2025:localhost:25 exec /etc/r%sd"</pre></blockquote>
This solution can get tricky if you're accessing multiple
mailboxes, not only because the command is run for every mailbox, but
also because it may run multiple times
<a name="INDEX-1672" />concurrently. Once the forwarded
ports are already established, subsequent invocations will fail. More
specifically, SSH1 and OpenSSH will fail altogether; SSH2 issues a
warning but continues.</p></li></ul>
A custom connection script can solve these and other problems. The
following Perl script examines the target server and returns failure
immediately if it isn't among a small set of known names. This
means that Pine moves quickly past the
<tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> command for other servers
and attempts a direct IMAP connection. The script also discovers
whether SMTP and NNTP forwardings are in place, and includes those in
the SSH command only if they aren't. To use this script or
another like it, point Pine's
<tt class="literal">rsh-path</tt> option to your script, and
set <tt class="literal">rsh-command</tt> to be compatible
with your script:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">rsh-path=/path/to/script
rsh-command=%s %s %s %s</pre></blockquote>



Here is a sample implementation of the script, using Perl:</p>



<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/perl

# TCP/IP module
use IO::Socket;

# get the arguments passed by Pine
($server,$remoteuser,$method) = @ARGV;

die "usage: $0 &lt;server&gt; &lt;remote user&gt; &lt;method&gt;"
    unless scalar @ARGV == 3;

if ($server eq "mail.isp.com") {
    # on this machine, I had to compile my own imapd
    $command = 'cd ~/bin; exec imapd';
} else if ($server eq "clueful.isp.com") {
    # on this box, the POP and IMAP servers are in the expected place
    $command = 'exec /etc/r${method}d';
} else {
    # signal Pine to move on
    exit 1;
}

$smtp = 25;  # well-known port for SMTP 
$nntp = 119; # and NNTP 
$smtp_proxy = 2025; # local port for forwarding SMTP connection
$nntp_proxy = 2119; # local port for forwarding NNTP connection
$ssh = '/usr/local/bin/ssh1'; # which SSH do I want to run?

# Try to connect to the forwarded SMTP port; only do forwarding if the
# attempt fails.  Also, do forwarding only if we're not in the domain
# "home.net".  The idea is that that's your home network, where you have
# direct access to your ISP's mail and news servers.

$do_forwards = !defined($socket = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new("localhost:$smtp_proxy"))
    &amp;&amp; `domainname` !~ /HOME.NET/i;

# be tidy
close $socket if $socket;

# Set the forwarding options if we're doing forwarding.  This assumes that
# the mail and news servers are called "mail" and "news", respectively, in
# your ISP's domain; a common and useful convention.

@forward = ('-L',"$smtp_proxy:mail:$smtp",'-L',"$nntp_proxy:news:$nntp");
    if ($do_forwards);

# prepare the arguments to ssh
@ssh_argv = ('-a','-x','-q',@forward,"$remoteuser\@$server");

# run ssh
exec $ssh, @ssh_argv, $command;<a name="INDEX-1673" /></pre></blockquote>
