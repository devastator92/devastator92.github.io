<h2 class="sect1">0.9. Acknowledgments for the First Edition</h2>





Note: We've preserved these acknowledgments for the first
edition because we continue to be grateful to the people who helped
us with that edition. Note, however, that several parts of the first
edition (e.g., the foreword and the TCP/IP appendix) are no longer
included in the book.</p><p>





When we set out to write this book, we had no idea that it would
consume so much time and energy. We would never have succeeded
without the help of many people.</p><p>





Special thanks to Ed DeHart and Craig Hunt. Ed worked with Brent in
the early stages of this book and wrote the foreword to it; we
appreciate all that he has done to help. TCP/IP is essential for
understanding the basics of firewall construction, and Craig
Hunt, author of <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network Administration</em>
(O'Reilly &amp; Associates) has kindly let us excerpt much of
that book's <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "Why Internet Firewalls?"</a> and <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Internet Services"</a> in this book's <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a> so readers who do not already have a TCP/IP
background can get a jump start.</p><p>





Thanks to all those who reviewed drafts of the book before
publication and made helpful suggestions: Fred Avolio, Steve
Bellovin, Niels Bjergstrom, Rik Farrow, Simson Garfinkel, Eliot
Lear, Evi Nemeth, Steve Simmons, Steve Romig, Gene Spafford, Phil
Trubey, and Mark Verber. Thanks as well to Eric Allman for answering
many Sendmail questions and Paul Traina for answering many Cisco
questions.</p><p>





Thanks to all the people at O'Reilly &amp; Associates who
turned this manuscript into a finished book: to Mary Anne Weeks
ayo, the wonderful and patient project manager/copyeditor for the
book; Len Muellner, Ellen Siever, and Norm Walsh, who converted the
book from Word to SGML and contributed their tool-tweaking prowess;
Chris Reilley, who created the many excellent diagrams; Edie
Freedman, who designed the cover, and Nancy Priest, who designed the
interior layout; John Files and Juliette Muellner, who assisted with
production; Seth Maislin, who prepared the index; and Sheryl Avruch
and Kismet McDonough-Chan, who did the final quality control on
the book.</p><p>





Brent says: I would like to extend personal thanks to my friends and
family, for keeping me going for a year and a half while I worked on
the book; to my staff at Great Circle Associates, for keeping my
business going; to the many hundreds of folks who've attended
my Internet Security Firewalls Tutorial, for providing the impetus
for this whole endeavor (and for keeping my bills paid!); and to the
many thousands of subscribers to the Firewalls mailing list on the
Internet, for providing a stimulating environment to develop many of
the ideas found in this book. I also owe a lot of thanks to Debby
Russell, our editor at O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for all her
help and guidance, and to our technical reviewers, for all their
wonderful comments and suggestions. Most of all, though, I'd
like to thank my very good friend and coauthor, Elizabeth Zwicky,
without whose collaboration and encouragement this book probably
never would have been finished, and certainly wouldn't
have been as good.</p><p>





Elizabeth says: My thanks go to my friends, my family, and my
colleagues at Silicon Graphics, for an almost infinite patience
with my tendency to alternate between obsessing about the book and
refusing to discuss anything even tangentially related to it.
I'd like to particularly thank Arnold Zwicky, Diana Smetters,
Greg Rose, Eliot Lear, and Jeanne Dusseault for their expert moral
support (often during similar crises of their own). But the most
thanks for this effort have to go to Debby and Brent, for giving me a
chance to be part of an unexpected but extremely rewarding project.</p><p>
