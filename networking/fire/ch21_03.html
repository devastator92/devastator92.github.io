<h2 class="sect1">21.3. Authentication Mechanisms</h2>





In order to use any of the methods of authentication we've
outlined earlier, you need hardware or software to implement them.
This section discusses some of the commonly available hardware and
software authentication mechanisms that are at the heart of
authentication systems (in particular, it discusses those supported
by TIS FWTK, which is the most widely available system). The most
popular of the full-blown systems are discussed later in this
chapter.</p><p>





<a name="ch21-20408" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.3.1. One-Time Password Software</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1966" /><a name="INDEX-1967" />There are two ways a one-time password
system may work:</p><p>





<ul><li>The list can be generated randomly, and a copy kept by the user and
the system.</p><p></li><li>The list (or, more likely, a specific entry from the list) can be
generated on demand by the user and validated by the system.</p><p></li></ul>
The problem with keeping a list on the system is that if the system
is compromised, so is the list, and the list could then be used for
future access. This is as bad as having someone snoop on a reusable
password while you use it.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1968" /> <a name="INDEX-1969" />An
IETF standard addresses this problem; it's a system called OTP
(for one-time password), which is based on S/Key, originally designed
by Leslie Lamport and developed by Bellcore. While it allows a system
to reliably authenticate a user, nothing on the system compromises
the user's password if the system itself is compromised. The
system has the ability to validate a user's current response
but does not have the ability to predict what that user's
<em class="emphasis">next</em> response will be.</p><p>





OTP works by iteratively applying a cryptographically secure hash
algorithm, starting with some initial seed value. A cryptographically
secure hash algorithm is one that takes arbitrary-sized input and
produces a much smaller output (something like a checksum) that has
two special properties:</p><p>





<ul><li>The input cannot be regenerated from the output; thus, it's not
simply a compression or encryption algorithm.</p><p></li><li>The probability of two different inputs (particularly two different
inputs of the same size) producing the same output is vanishingly
small.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-1970" />OTP can use a
variety of different algorithms for this purpose. All OTP systems
must support MD5, and they are encouraged to also support SHA and
D4. (The original S/Key used only MD4.) Cryptographic checksum
algorithms are discussed further in <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>





OTP works by starting with a seed (which is either provided by the
user or generated randomly) and applying the chosen hash algorithm
iteratively to get a sequence of keys. It applies the hash algorithm
to the seed to get the first key, applies the hash algorithm to the
first key to get the second key, applies the hash algorithm to the
second key to get the third key, and so on. In order to validate a
user, the system has to know some key (call it key number
<em class="emphasis">n</em>) in the sequence. The system prompts the user
for the previous key (key <em class="emphasis">n-</em>1), applies the hash
algorithm to the user's answer (supposedly key
<em class="emphasis">n</em>-1), and checks to see if the result is the key
<em class="emphasis">n</em> that it knows. If the result is the key
<em class="emphasis">n</em>, the user must have supplied the correct key
<em class="emphasis">n</em>-1.</p><p>





OTP can encode each key into a series of short words, so they are
easier for a user to read and type, rather than simply generating a
random-looking jumble of characters. <a href="ch21_03.html#ch21-37783">Figure 21-1</a>
shows how OTP works.</p><p>





<a name="ch21-37783" /><div class="figure"><img height="360" alt="Figure 21-1" src="figs/fire2.2101.gif" width="456" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 21-1. How OTP works</h4>

Because cryptographic hashing is nonreversible (you can't
determine the input given the output), the system can't easily
figure out what key <em class="emphasis">n</em>-1 is, even though it knows
key <em class="emphasis">n</em>. All the server can do is to verify that
key <em class="emphasis">n</em>-1 (when presented by the user) is the key
that generates key <em class="emphasis">n</em>. This means that even if an
attacker can somehow obtain key <em class="emphasis">n</em> (for example,
by snooping on a user's login session), he won't be able
to easily figure out the next key (key <em class="emphasis">n-</em>1).</p><p>





OTP isn't absolutely invulnerable to attack. Several attacks
are possible:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Brute force attacks</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1971" />Attackers could try a whole series of
possibilities for key <em class="emphasis">n</em>-1 until they found one
that translated to key <em class="emphasis">n</em>. However, this type of
attack is very unlikely to succeed. Because of the size of the key
space (the number of possible keys) and the computation requirements
of cryptographic hashing, a brute force approach of this kind is
considered to be computationally infeasible for all but the most
serious and well-financed attackers. (It would probably take a
significant amount of supercomputer time before they found the right
key.)</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Dictionary attacks</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1972" />If the
user provides the initial seed (rather than having the initial seed
be generated randomly), dictionary attacks are possible. Attackers
could guess at the seed in the same way that they might guess at
reusable passwords; they'd typically try things like words from
the dictionary, names, places, etc. To these words, they would apply
the cryptographic hashing algorithm an appropriate number of times to
see if it generates a key they've seen used.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Modified sniffing attacks </i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1973" />An
attacker can run a packet sniffer and collect the beginning of an OTP
password (all but the last few characters) and then try all the
possible combinations for the last characters, before the user
finishes. This relies on extremely delicate timing, but in Telnet
connections, user input is frequently sent keystroke by keystroke as
it is generated. This creates a lag that is significant for a
computer. An attacker probably won't be able to try all
possible combinations but may be able to try all possible
combinations that make English words. OTP implementations are
required to try to prevent this attack, which is usually done by
preventing multiple simultaneous connections from the same user.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





There are two ways for users to use OTP: either keys can be generated
on demand, or the user can be supplied with a printed list of keys.</p><p>





To generate OTP keys on demand, the user needs a computer and a
program to generate them. That user will have to provide the seed,
the key number, and the cryptographic algorithm to be used, and the
program will iterate the algorithm that many times to generate the
key desired. The seed will have to be either entered by the user or
read from a file on the computer. If the seed is entered by the user,
the user would probably pick a seed the same way he or she would pick
a password. Because users are notoriously poor at picking passwords,
this makes the system subject to dictionary attacks, as we've
described earlier. If the seed is read from a file, it can be more
random (and therefore less guessable) than something the user would
provide, but you have to worry about the risks  --  probably low
 --  of the computer or file being stolen.</p><p>





The alternative way to use OTP is to have the system generate and
print a list of keys, enough keys to last the user for a reasonable
period of time. In this case, the system randomly generates the
initial seed, thus protecting itself against dictionary attacks. The
printout should simply be a numbered list of keys, with no further
identification or explanation. It is possible that the list could be
stolen from a user, but you have to decide which you think is more
likely: that the list will be stolen (and that the thief will know
what it is and what to do with it), or that the user's session
will be snooped on. If your users are generating keys on demand,
they're probably using a seed that's subject to
dictionary attack (otherwise, they would find it too hard to remember
the seed); if one of their sessions is snooped on, their keys can be
attacked.</p><p>





We think that using a seed that's subject to dictionary attack
is a greater risk than having a list of keys stolen, so we prefer
using printed lists of keys to using keys generated on
demand.<a name="INDEX-1974" />

<h3 class="sect2">21.3.2. One-Time Password Hardware</h3>





There are also systems for generating nonreusable passwords in
hardware. The systems in common use are small cards, about the size
of miniature calculators. You install software and/or hardware on the
computer, and a user who wants to log in uses information generated
by the card as part of the process. In order to prevent attackers
from simply stealing the card, there is usually a "something
you know" component, which is either a fixed password used to
unlock the card itself, or a fixed password added to the generated
information as part of the login process.</p><p>





These systems use a variety of different ways to generate passwords.
Some of them vary the password based on the time; some of them work
their way through a one-time password list; and some of them use a
challenge-response system, where the computer provides a challenge
that the user types into the card, and the card provides a response
for the user to give the computer.</p><p>





Although the card-based systems have different strengths and
weaknesses, they share the same general advantages and disadvantages.
On the good side, they provide a guaranteed level of protection
without requiring special reader hardware; on the bad side, there are
considerable hardware costs for the cards, and you have to alter
login software on the machines that you want to protect. Most
authentication systems now contain support for the popular cards, but
you will still need to install vendor libraries.</p><p>





Card-based tokens are something of a hassle for their users, who have
to carry the device, type things into it, read things from it, and
protect a small and expensive object from being damaged or lost.
Printed one-time password lists also present a certain number of user
annoyances; there's nothing like turning over your list to
discover that the print has worn off the next password you need.</p><p>





Other hardware "something you have" options avoid many of
these problems. For instance, smart cards, which put a small amount
of information into a chip suitable for embedding in a credit
card-sized object, are cheaper, easier to carry, and don't have
keypads or readouts to fiddle with. The "secret encoder
ring", which puts a small transmitter into a device that will
pass for a chunky ring or a smallish ornament for your keys, is still
a small, valuable object that you have to protect, but it
doesn't have a keypad or a readout, and it's emotionally
very satisfying. However, all of these options require reader
hardware at the location where the user needs to authenticate. Smart
card readers are becoming more prevalent, and smart cards are the
most likely of these options to be practical for widespread use.
While it's unlikely that Internet cafes and terminals in
airports will provide smart card readers soon, it's relatively
easy to get them for laptop computers.</p><p>





You can also use hand-held computers like Palm Pilots and Windows CE
machines to generate one-time passwords. It is very convenient for
people who already have these devices, but it is not as secure as
using devices that are designed to be security tokens.
General-purpose hand-held devices do not provide hardware protection
(they can be taken apart, so that people have access to the data).
ost of them don't provide significant software protection,
either; you can set a password, but it's generally easy to
guess, and if you back the device up to a larger computer, the data
is usually completely unprotected on the larger computer. If you use
these devices for one-time passwords, you should consider adding
additional access protection beyond that provided with the device.</p><p>
