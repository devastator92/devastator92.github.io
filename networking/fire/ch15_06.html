<h2 class="sect1">15.6. Push Technologies</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1472" /> <a name="INDEX-1473" />HTTP is a system in which clients
ask for the information that they want (this is referred to as a
<em class="emphasis">pull</em> <em class="emphasis">technology</em>, where the
client pulls the information). In some situations, it is desirable
for the server to send the information without being asked (this is a
<em class="emphasis">push</em> <em class="emphasis">technology</em>, where the
server pushes the information). For instance, if you want to be
informed of some event (a change in a stock price, the outcome of a
baseball game, a news item about an area of interest), it's
most effective for you to inform the server about your interests
once, and then have it send you the information when it becomes
available. With standard HTTP, you would have to ask for the
information repeatedly to see if it had arrived.</p><p>





Around 1997, push technologies were predicted as the next big thing
on the Web, the most exciting thing to happen since the introduction
of TV. They have yet to get much acceptance, for a combination of
reasons. First, users have a strong and well-founded suspicion that
the main reason that vendors want push technologies is so that they
can push advertisements and other information that the user
wouldn't have requested. Second, security and network bandwidth
considerations cause site administrators to dislike the idea of
having incoming unrequested information streams. At this moment, the
magic application that would drive people to accept push technologies
has not shown up, although there is a significant population that
think the existing programs are really cool.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1474" />
<a name="INDEX-1475" />A number of
competing programs still claim to be push technologies, although the
number has been reduced in recent years. Currently, the popular
programs (notably Pointcast and BackWeb) don't actually have to
be push-based. Instead, they give an illusion of being push-based by
using special HTTP clients that make regular requests for updates to
specialized HTTP servers that inform them of changes in the
information the user is watching. This polling process is transparent
to the user, who sees something that looks like it's
push-based.</p><p>





This approach removes many of the difficulties with true push-based
technologies. It doesn't require a new protocol or inbound
connections, for instance. On the other hand, it does use bandwidth
as the clients check for updates. The specialized clients are
generally aware of proxies but may not support all the same features
that normal web browsers support (for instance, they don't
generally have support for auto-configuration of proxies or for proxy
authentication schemes).</p><p>





The specialized clients don't tend to have the same security
implications that traditional web browsers do (they don't
support extension languages or external viewers, for instance; they
call normal web browsers to deal with complex pages).
<a name="INDEX-1476" />They do have their own
security implications (for instance, the clients are providing
information to the server as part of the queries they make and are
accepting data from the server).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1477" />
<a name="INDEX-1478" />Some of the
traditional web browsers also support things that look like push
technology (for instance, Explorer has Active Channels and Netscape
has Netcaster). These are in fact based on polling over normal HTTP,
sometimes with additional information to optimize the polling. In
general, their security implications are identical to those of normal
web browsing. Note that if you are pulling web pages that require
authentication information, either you will have to provide that
information at the start of the download (so much for having it
automatically updated while you sleep), or you will have to trust the
program to safely store the authentication information. In addition,
these services make local copies of the web pages, and you should be
sure that those are appropriately protected.</p><p>





There are also genuine push technologies in use, and both BackWeb and
PointCast will run as genuine push technologies when they can, using
their own protocols. It's not clear what security implications
these protocols have, since they're proprietary. However, they
accept inbound connections, often return data, and usually have
little or no authentication. While there have not been many security
problems with them so far, that may simply be because they are not
popular enough to attract many attackers. Certainly there seems to be
good reason to worry about their security. It is also possible to
combine a traditional web browser with a specialized push client
using plug-ins, and PointCast provides such a plug-in. The plug-in
has the same security implications as the normal PointCast service.</p><p>
