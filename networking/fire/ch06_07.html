<h2 class="sect1">6.7. Internal Firewalls</h2>





<a name="INDEX-464" /><a name="INDEX-465" /><a name="INDEX-466" /><a name="INDEX-467" />The
assumption in most of the discussions in this book is that you are
building a firewall to protect your internal network from the
Internet. However, in some situations, you may also be protecting
parts of your internal network from other parts. There are a number
of reasons why you might want to do this:</p><p>





<ul><li>You have test or lab networks with strange things going on there.</p><p></li><li>You have networks that are less secure than the rest of your
site -- for example, demonstration or teaching networks where
outsiders are commonly present.</p><p></li><li>You have networks that are more secure than the rest of your
site -- for example, secret development projects or networks where
financial data or grades are passed around.</p><p></li></ul>
This is another situation where firewalls are a useful technology. In
some cases, you will want to build <em class="emphasis">internal
firewalls</em>; that is, firewalls that sit between two parts
of the same organization, or between two separate organizations that
share a network, rather than between a single organization and the
Internet.</p><p>





It often makes sense to keep one part of your organization separate
from another. Not everyone in an organization needs the same services
or information, and security is frequently more important in some
parts of an organization (the accounting department, for example)
than in others.</p><p>





any of the same tools and techniques you use to build Internet
firewalls are also useful for building these internal firewalls.
However, there are some special considerations that you will need to
keep in mind if you are building an internal firewall. <a href="ch06_07.html#ch06-51407">Figure 6-17</a> shows this architecture.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-51407" /><div class="figure"><img height="302" alt="Figure 6-17" src="figs/fire2.0617.gif" width="475" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-17. Firewall architecture with an internal firewall</h4>

<a name="ch06-2257" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.7.1. Laboratory Networks</h3>





<a name="INDEX-468" /><a name="INDEX-469" /><a name="INDEX-470" />Laboratory and test networks are often
the first networks that people consider separating from the rest of
an organization via a firewall (usually as the result of some
horrible experience where something escapes the laboratory and runs
amok). Unless people are working on routers, this type of firewall
can be quite simple. Neither a perimeter net nor a bastion host is
needed, because there is no worry about snooping (all users are
internal anyway), and you don't need to provide many services
(the machines are not people's home machines). In most cases,
you'll want a packet filtering router that allows any
connection inbound to the test network but only known safe
connections from it. (What's safe will depend on what the test
network is playing with, rather than on the normal security
considerations.)</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-471" /><a name="INDEX-472" />In
a few cases (for example, if you are testing bandwidth on the
network), you may want to protect the test network from outside
traffic that would invalidate tests, in which case you'll deny
inbound connections and allow outbound connections.</p><p>





If you are testing routers, it's probably wisest to use an
entirely disconnected network; if you don't do this, then at
least prevent the firewall router from listening to routing updates
from the test network. You can do this in a number of ways, depending
on your network setup, what you're testing, and what routers
you have available. You might do any of the following:</p><p>





<ul><li>Use a different routing protocol from the one under test and entirely
disable the protocol under test.</p><p></li><li>Tell the router not to accept any routing updates from the interface
under test and to filter out packets in the routing protocol.</p><p></li><li>Specify which hosts the router will accept updates from.</p></li></ul>
If you have a number of test networks, you may find it best to set up
a perimeter net for them and give each one a separate router onto the
perimeter net, putting most of the packet filtering in the router
between the perimeter and the main network. That way, if one test
network crashes its router, the rest still have their normal
connectivity.</p><p>





If your testing involves external connections, the test network has
to be treated as an external network itself; see <a href="ch06_07.html#ch06-2313">Section 6.7.4, "Joint Venture Firewalls"</a>, later in this chapter.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2288" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.7.2. Insecure Networks</h3>





<a name="INDEX-473" /><a name="INDEX-474" /><a name="INDEX-475" />Test
networks are dangerous but not necessarily less secure than other
networks. Many organizations also have some networks that are
intrinsically less secure than most. For example, a university may
consider networks that run through student dormitories to be
particularly insecure; a company may consider demonstration networks,
porting labs, and customer training networks to be particularly
insecure. Nevertheless, these insecure networks need more interaction
with the rest of the organization than does a purely external
network.</p><p>





Networks like dormitory networks and porting labs, where external
people have prolonged access and the ability to bring in their own
tools, are really as insecure as completely external networks and
should be treated that way. Either position them as a second external
connection (a new connection on your exterior router or a new
exterior router) or set up a separate perimeter network for them. The
only advantage these networks offer over purely external networks is
that you can specify particular software to be run on them, which
means you can make use of encryption effectively.</p><p>





External people may also be able to gain access to your internal
network if you use wireless networking devices. These network devices
provide more accessibility and less security than traditional fixed
networking. In particular, they often have a range that extends
outside of your physical building, and they provide little or no
authentication. This can allow anyone who owns a compatible device to
connect to your network by sitting in the parking lot or in an
adjacent building. Even if the range of the wireless device does not
extend outside of your facilities, they make it much harder to notice
a visitor attempting to gain access to your network. Some wireless
networking devices provide stronger authentication and encryption
facilities that prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized access. In
most cases, however, you should treat a wireless network as an
untrusted network and place a firewall between it and the rest of
your network.</p><p>





Demonstration and training labs, where external people have
relatively brief, supervised access and cannot bring in tools, can be
more trusted (as long as you are sure that people really do have
relatively brief, supervised access and cannot bring in tools!). You
still need to use a packet filtering router or a dual-homed host to
prevent confidential traffic from flowing across those networks. You
will also want to limit those networks to connections to servers you
consider secure. However, you may be willing to provide NFS service
from particular servers, for example, which you wouldn't do to
a purely untrusted network. One of your main concerns should be
preventing your trusted users from doing unsafe things while working
on those networks (for example, logging into the machines on their
desks and forgetting to log out again, or reading confidential
electronic mail). This should be done with a combination of training
and force (ensuring that the most insecure uses fail).</p><p>





This is a place where a dual-homed host can be quite useful, even
with no proxies on it; the number of people who need to use the host
is probably small, and having to log into it will ensure that they
see warning messages. The host will also be unable to provide some
tempting but highly insecure services; for example, you won't
be able to run NFS except from the dual-homed host, and people
won't be able to mount their home machine's filesystems.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2303" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.7.3. Extra-Secure Networks</h3>





Just as most organizations have points where they're
particularly insecure, most of them have points where they're
particularly security-conscious, such as:</p><p>





<ul><li>Particularly exciting research projects</p><p></li><li>New products under development</p></li><li><p>The accounting, personnel, and finance machines</p></li><li><p>The registrar's office at a university</p></li><li><p>Unclassified but sensitive government work</p></li><li><p>Joint work with other organizations</p></li></ul>
any countries have legal requirements for the protection of personal
data, which are likely to apply to anywhere that employee, student,
client, or patient records are kept. Some unclassified government
work also requires extra protections.</p><p>





Networks for doing classified work  --  at any level of
classification  --  not only need to be more secure, but also need
to meet all relevant government regulations. Generally speaking, they
will have to be separated from unclassified networks. In any case,
they are outside of the scope of this book. If you need to set one
up, consult your security officer; traditional firewalls will not
meet the requirements.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-16">[16]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-16" />[16]If you don't have a
security officer, you're not going to have a classified
network, either.</p><p>




</blockquote>





You can choose to meet your requirements for extra security either by
encrypting traffic that passes over your regular internal networks,
or by setting up separate networks for the secure traffic. Separate
networks are technically easier as long as separate machines are on
them. That is, if you have a secure research project that owns
particular computers, and if people log into them to work on that
project, it's reasonably simple to set up a straightforward
single-machine firewall (a packet filtering router, most likely).
That firewall will treat your normal network as the insecure external
universe. Because the lab machines probably don't need many
services, a bastion host is unnecessary, and a perimeter net is
needed only for the most secret ventures.</p><p>





If you are dealing with people whose day-to-day work is secure, and
who don't have separate machines for that work, a separate
network becomes harder to implement. If you put their machines onto a
more secure network, they can't work easily with everybody else
at the site, and they need a number of services. In this case,
you'll need a full bastion host and therefore probably a
perimeter net to put it on. It's tempting to connect their
machines to <em class="emphasis">two</em> networks, the secure net and the
insecure net, so they can transmit confidential data over one and
participate with the rest of the site on the other, but this is a
configuration nightmare. If they're attached to both at once,
each host is basically a dual-homed host firewall, with all the
attendant maintenance problems. If they can be attached to only one
at a time, things are more secure. However, configuring the machines
is unpleasant for you, and moving back and forth is unpleasant for
the user.</p><p>





At a university, where there are sharp distinctions between different
organizations, putting the registrar's office and the financial
people on secure networks, firewalled from the rest of the
university, will probably work. At a company or government office,
where most people work in the same environment, look into using
encryption in your applications instead.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2313" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.7.4. Joint Venture Firewalls</h3>





<a name="INDEX-476" /><a name="INDEX-477" /><a name="INDEX-478" />Sometimes, organizations come together
for certain limited reasons, such as a joint project; they need to be
able to share machines, data, and other resources for the duration of
the project. For example, look at the decision of IBM and Apple to
collaborate on the PowerPC; undertaking one joint project
doesn't mean that IBM and Apple have decided to merge their
organizations or to open up all their operations to each other.</p><p>





Although the two parties have decided to trust each other for the
purposes of this project, they are still competitors. They want to
protect most of their systems and information from each other. It
isn't just that they may distrust each other; it's also
that they can't be sure how good the other's security is.
They don't want to risk that an intruder into their
partner's system might, through this joint venture, find a
route into their system as well. This security problem occurs even if
the collaborators aren't competitors.</p><p>





You may also want to connect to an external company because it is an
outside vendor to you. A number of services depend on information
transfer, from shipping (you tell them what you want to ship; they
tell you what happened to your shipment), to architecture (you give
them specifications; they give you designs), to chip fabrication (you
send them the chip design, they give you status on the fabrication
process). These outside vendors are not competitors in any sense, but
they frequently also work for competitors of yours. They are probably
aware of confidentiality issues and try to protect the information
they are supposed to have, to the best of their ability. On the other
hand, if there are routing slip-ups, and data you're not
explicitly sending to them crosses their networks, they are probably
going to be completely unconscious of it, and the data will be at
risk.</p><p>





This may seem far-fetched, but it turns out to be a fairly routine
occurrence. One company was mystified to discover routes on its
network for a competitor's internal network, and still more
baffled to discover traffic using these routes. It turned out that
the shortest route between them and their competitor was through a
common outside vendor. The traffic was not confidential because it
was all traffic that would have gone through the Internet. On the
other hand, the connection to the outside vendor was not treated as
if it were an Internet connection (the outside vendor itself was not
Internet-connected, and nobody had considered the possibility of its
cross-connecting Internet-connected clients). Both companies had
sudden, unexpected, and unprotected vulnerabilities.</p><p>





An internal firewall limits exposure in such a situation. It provides
a mechanism for sharing some resources, while protecting most of
them. Before you set out to build an internal firewall, be sure
you're clear on what you want to share, protect, and
accomplish. Ask these questions:</p><p>





<ul><li>What exactly do you want to accomplish by linking your network with
some other organization's network? The answer to this question
will determine what services you need to provide (and, by
implication, what services should be blocked).</p><p></li><li>Are you trying to create a full work environment for a joint project
in which team members from both organizations can work together and
yet still have access to their own "home" systems (which
need to be protected from the other organization)? In such a case,
you might actually need two firewalls: one between the joint project
net and each of the home organizations.</p><p></li></ul>
Exactly what you're trying to accomplish, and what your
security concerns are, will determine what firewall technologies are
going to be useful to you.</p><p>

<a name="ch06-2342" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.7.5. A Shared Perimeter Network Allows an "Arms-Length"Relationship</h3>





<a name="INDEX-479" />Shared
perimeter networks are a good way to approach joint networks. Each
party can install its own router under its own control, onto a
perimeter net between the two organizations. In some configurations,
these two routers might be the only machines on the perimeter net,
with no bastion host. If this is the case, then the "net"
might simply be a high-speed serial line (e.g., a 56 Kbps or T1/E1
line) between the two routers, rather than an Ethernet or another
type of local area network.</p><p>





This is highly desirable with an outside vendor. Most of them are not
networking wizards, and they may attempt to economize by connecting
multiple clients to the same perimeter network. If the perimeter net
is an Ethernet or something similar, any client that can get to its
router on that perimeter network can see the traffic for all the
clients on that perimeter network  --  which, with some providers,
is almost guaranteed to be confidential information belonging to a
competitor. Using a point-to-point connection as the "perimeter
net" between the outside vendor and each client, rather than a
shared multiclient perimeter net, will prevent them from doing this,
even accidentally.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2349" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.7.6. An Internal Firewall May or May Not Need Bastion Hosts</h3>





<a name="INDEX-480" /><a name="INDEX-481" />You might not actually need to place a
bastion host on the perimeter network between two organizations. The
decision about whether you need a bastion host depends on what
services are required for your firewall and how much each
organization trusts the other. Bastion hosts on the perimeter net are
rarely required for relationships with outside vendors; usually you
are sending data over one particular protocol and can adequately
protect that as a screened host.</p><p>





If the organizations have a reasonable amount of trust in each other
(and, by extension, in each other's security), it may be
reasonable to establish the packet filters so that clients on the
other side can connect to internal servers (such as SMTP and DNS
servers) directly.</p><p>





On the other hand, if the organizations distrust each other, they
might each want to place their own bastion host, under their own
control and management, on the perimeter net. Traffic would flow from
one party's internal systems, to their bastion host, to the
other party's bastion host, and finally to the other
party's internal systems.<a name="INDEX-482" /><a name="INDEX-483" /> <a name="INDEX-484" /><a name="INDEX-485" /><a name="INDEX-486" /><a name="INDEX-487" /><a name="INDEX-488" /><a name="INDEX-489" /><a name="INDEX-490" /><a name="INDEX-491" /></p><p>
