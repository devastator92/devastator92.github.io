<h2 class="sect1">C.2. Key Components of Cryptographic Systems</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2473" /> <a name="INDEX-2474" />Cryptography is used for
multiple things, and cryptographic systems are built out of multiple
parts. Encryption is the best-known and most obvious technique, but
in order to understand how cryptography is used, you need to
understand several other techniques as well, including those used for
cryptographic hashing, integrity protection, and the generation of
random numbers.</p><p>





<a name="appc-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.2.1. Encryption</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2475" />Encryption
is the process of reversibly hiding information. When you encrypt
something, you take a piece of data (called the
<em class="emphasis">plaintext</em>) and apply a process that produces
another piece of data (called the <em class="emphasis">ciphertext</em>).
There must also be a process for turning the ciphertext back into
plaintext.<a name="INDEX-2476" />
<a name="INDEX-2477" /></p><p>





It's not practical to think up a new algorithm every time you
want to encrypt something. Useful encryption algorithms therefore use
an extra piece of data called a <em class="emphasis">key</em>. In order to
decrypt data, you need not only the decryption algorithm, but also
the key; this means that you can use the same algorithm to encrypt
different things and share them with different people. If an
encryption algorithm doesn't use a key, then as soon as you
know the decryption algorithm, you can decrypt all the things
encrypted with the algorithm.</p><p>





Cryptographic wisdom considers an encryption process secure when the
only way to recover a plaintext message from ciphertext is to know or
discover the key. Furthermore, this rule should still be true even if
every other detail about the encryption process is known. In fact,
cryptographers become very concerned about the security of an
algorithm when more than a key must be kept secret (for instance,
when the algorithm or an important part of it is not disclosed).</p><p>





There are some things that encryption cannot do. When you encrypt
something, you conceal its content, which doesn't necessarily
conceal everything useful about it. Attackers may be able to gain
important information by looking at the lengths of messages, or the
times they're sent, or the senders and receivers; none of that
will be changed by encryption.</p><p>





Furthermore, encrypting something does not protect it from being
changed. Somebody who has access to the ciphertext can change it.
They won't be able to predict exactly what plaintext
you'll get, but it will almost certainly be different. This
sort of tampering is normally easy for a human to detect in text but
not so if the plaintext was binary data. Since computers are unable
to comprehend text, they cannot detect tampering by inspection as
humans can. In order to protect a message from modification, and in a
way that a computer can detect, you must use integrity protection,
which we will discuss. Although some integrity protection systems use
encryption, encryption by itself does not provide integrity
protection.</p><p>





<a name="appc-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">C.2.1.1. Kinds of encryption algorithms</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2478" />
<a name="INDEX-2479" />There
are two main families of encryption algorithms: symmetric and public
key. A <em class="emphasis">symmetric algorithm</em> uses one key for both
encryption and decryption. A <em class="emphasis">public key
algorithm</em> uses two matching keys; when you encrypt with
one of the keys, you use the other one to decrypt.</p><p>





The primary characteristic of an encryption algorithm is its
strength, which is the amount of effort it takes for somebody to turn
the ciphertext into plaintext without having the key. There's
no absolute measure of the strength of an encryption algorithm.
It's possible to say that some algorithms are very weak (for
instance, replacing every letter with the letter three characters
later in the alphabet, so that "b" becomes
"e" and "c" becomes "f", is
definitely a very weak algorithm), and it's possible to say
that some algorithms have no known weaknesses. When we discuss
particular algorithms, we will mention algorithms that are known to
be attackable, or weak. A wide range of algorithms are available that
don't have known weaknesses, and in most circumstances, you can
and should choose one of them.</p><p>





In the real world, strength is not the only important characteristic
of an encryption algorithm. Some algorithms are much faster to
execute than others, for instance, and the speed may depend on the
kind of processor you have available. Some algorithms require more
memory than others. Some algorithms have legal restrictions on their
use, which are different in different countries. Some algorithms are
patented and are expensive or difficult to license.</p><p>





Public key and symmetric algorithms differ on all of these fronts
(most notably, symmetric algorithms are much faster than public key
algorithms), but the most important difference between them comes
from the extra capabilities of public key algorithms. With a
symmetric key algorithm, anybody who can encrypt a message can also
decrypt the message, and it is therefore important to keep the one
key secure so that it is known only by the parties who are trying to
communicate. With a public key algorithm, you can make one key public
while keeping the other one completely private, so that only you know
it.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2480" /> <a name="INDEX-2481" />
<a name="INDEX-2482" />Having a public key and a private key
opens up a number of new uses of cryptography. For instance, if you
encrypt something with your private key, you don't keep the
data secret (anybody who has the public key can read it), but you do
prove that you encrypted it (because only you have the private key).
This is called <em class="emphasis">signing</em>. Digital signatures are
discussed in detail later in this appendix. Anybody who wants to send
you something secret can encrypt it with your public key, and be sure
that only you can read it. In fact, some ways of using public key
technology don't actually allow you to conceal data; you can
only use them for authentication; some public key algorithms are not
encryption algorithms.</p><p>





Just as there are differences between public key algorithms and
symmetric algorithms, there are differences among symmetric
algorithms. Some work on fixed-sized chunks of data and are called
<em class="emphasis">block ciphers</em>. Others, called <em class="emphasis">stream
ciphers</em>, work on an arbitrary sequence of bits or bytes.
There are various ways, called <em class="emphasis">modes</em>, to extend
a block cipher so that it can encrypt more than just a single block
of data. Stream ciphers are naturally designed to handle an
arbitrarily sized stream of data.</p><p>





The encryption of variable amounts of data is usually called
<em class="emphasis">bulk</em> <em class="emphasis">encryption</em>. In this
case, anything bigger than about 64 bits is considered
"bulk". Almost all bulk encryption is done with symmetric
algorithms because of the speed difference between symmetric and
public key encryption. It is frequently desirable to use bulk
encryption in situations where the communicating parties don't
already have a common symmetric encryption key. An extremely common
way to solve this problem is to combine public key cryptography with
symmetric key cryptography. For instance, the PGP package, commonly
used for bulk encryption of electronic mail, uses a symmetric key
algorithm to encrypt the body of a mail message, and then uses public
key encryption to encrypt the symmetric key and sends the encrypted
symmetric key with the message.</p><p>

<a name="appc-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">C.2.1.2. Encryption algorithms and key length</h3>





One of the important ways algorithms differ is in the keys they use.
As we've discussed before, in order to decrypt something that
was encrypted with a strong algorithm, you have to know what the key
is. Therefore, one way that people attack encryption algorithms is to
try to figure out the key. There are obviously many ways to go about
this, most of which are not under the control of the encryption
algorithm (for instance, you can go around looking for places where
the key is recorded and not adequately secured).</p><p>





However, some ways of figuring out keys are based on how the
algorithm works. With a symmetric key algorithm, the easiest way to
figure out a key is to try all the possible keys until you find the
correct one (knowing you have found the correct key is a separate,
and tricky, problem). The more possible keys there are, the harder it
is. With a public key algorithm, you can try to calculate a private
key based on the public key using existing mathematical techniques if
you know that you have a fast enough computer with enough memory, or
you can invent a new mathematical theory for solving the equations
used in the public key algorithm. Either of these methodologies will
be easier than trying all possible private keys.</p><p>





For any given algorithm, the longer the key is, the harder it is to
find it out. On the other hand, you can't directly compare key
lengths between different kinds of algorithms because the ways that
they can be attacked are different. A 128-bit key is a pretty strong
key for a symmetric algorithm but a pretty weak one for most public
key algorithms. This is because 128 bits is a lot of keys to search
but not large enough to prevent mathematical attacks on public key
algorithms. Since different public key algorithms use different
relationships between the private key and the public key, key lengths
can't always be compared even between different public key
algorithms.</p><p>





If you know that trying all possible keys is the only way to find a
key, you can be reasonably confident about your security; the speed
of light imposes a theoretical limit on how fast computations can be
performed, so if the key is big enough, nobody can be sure to find it
within the estimated lifetime of the universe. (It's always
possible to get lucky when you're trying keys, but you're
much more likely to win a lottery.) The key length required to be big
enough is surprisingly short; it's under 128 bits.</p><p>





The situation with public keys is not as simple. Currently known
techniques for finding private keys are difficult on today's
computers, but it has yet to be proven that there are no faster
techniques.</p><p>





It's important to distinguish between key length and block
length when discussing block ciphers. These are often but not always
the same, and the block length is the length most often given. When
somebody refers to a "64-bit block cipher", that is the
length of the block, and not necessarily the length of the key. This
can be horribly confusing, since for other ciphers the key length is
the only thing normally specified in bits like that. Pay close
attention to which length is being specified; a "64-bit public
key algorithm" has a 64-bit key, while a "64-bit block
cipher" might have any key length at all.<a name="INDEX-2483" /> <a name="INDEX-2484" /><a name="INDEX-2485" /></p><p>

<a name="appc-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.2.2. Cryptographic Hashes, Checksums, and Message Digests</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2486" />
<a name="INDEX-2487" />
<a name="INDEX-2488" />A checksum is a number calculated on a
given set of data that is designed to detect changes or errors in
communication of that data. This is useful for a communications
channel; if a sender calculates a checksum as data is being sent and
a receiver does the same as it is being received, the two can simply
compare checksums to see if the data arrived intact or if an error
occurred during transmission. Another use might be to store the
checksum and then repeat the calculation at a later time. If the two
checksums are different, then something changed in the data.</p><p>





A checksum is usually just several bytes long and will take up much
less space than the original data. While this makes them easier to
store, it also means that there must be situations where a checksum
will give the same answer for two different pieces of data. This is
called a <em class="emphasis">collision</em>, and checksum algorithms are
designed to make collisions unlikely to occur for the differences
they are designed to detect. Checksum algorithms for communications
are designed to detect random bursts of errors or chunks of missing
data because they are the kinds of differences that you often get on
a telephone line or a radio transmission (to humans listening, these
errors sound like clicks or pops).</p><p>





What if the error was not random and a deliberate change was
intended? If so, is it possible to make a deliberate change and keep
the checksum the same? For many checksums, this is certainly possible
because the checksums are not designed to make this difficult. There
are ways to design checksum algorithms so that it is impossibly
difficult to make a deliberate change and still have the checksum
match. Algorithms designed this way are called
<em class="emphasis">cryptographic hash functions</em>,
<em class="emphasis">cryptographic checksums,</em> or <em class="emphasis">message
digest functions</em>.</p><p>





Note that the terminology used for the different techniques and uses
of cryptographic hashes is confusing and overlapping. As a result,
terms are not used very consistently; about the best you can say is
that any term involving <em class="emphasis">integrity</em>,
<em class="emphasis">digest</em>, or the acronym <em class="emphasis">MAC</em>
(Message Authentication Code) probably refers to some process that
uses some kind of hash. If you care about the details, investigate
them, rather than trusting that terms are used consistently from one
document to another.</p><p>





The term <em class="emphasis">hash</em> comes from another situation where
it is useful to have a short fixed-length string that you can
generate consistently from a larger string and that has large changes
in the output as a result of small changes to the input. Hash
algorithms and checksum algorithms are not always used for the same
purposes, but if you extend either concept for cryptographic
security, you reach the following set of conditions for a
cryptographic hash:</p><p>





<ul><li>It must be practically impossible to deliberately create data that
has a hash value that matches another. This can be achieved by
designing the algorithm so that it cannot be reversed and run
backwards (you can't start with a hash value and use a method
to create data that computes to the same hash).</p><p></li><li>The hash must be of a large enough size so that you cannot create a
list of files, one for each value the hash can have, and match a
given hash that way. In practical terms, this means that a useful
hash should be at least 128 bits and preferably 160 bits or more in
size.</p><p></li><li>If you change something only very slightly in the data, the hash will
change by a large amount. Changing one bit in the data should change
about half the bits in the hash. This makes it hard for people to
slowly adjust individual bits in the data to achieve a desired hash
value.</p><p></li></ul>
There are two principal uses for cryptographic hashes. First, they
are used to detect changes in data. If you have a cryptographic hash
for a piece of data and the hash is kept secure, you can be sure that
if you recalculate the hash and it is the same, then the data
hasn't been modified. This is the basis for digital signatures,
which are discussed later in this appendix.</p><p>





Cryptographic hashes are also frequently used in authentication
systems. In most cases, passwords are not encrypted, but hashed. If
you use encryption on a password, it is possible to decrypt it and
get back the password, which an attacker could then use somewhere
else. This makes storing and sending encrypted passwords dangerous.
Instead, secure systems store a hash of the password and, when a user
wants to authenticate to the system, compute a hash of the password
provided by the user. If the hashes match, the user must know the
correct password.</p><p>





This technique does not help if a user can directly provide the hash,
instead of the password (for instance, if the user is logging in over
a network and what the system actually receives is the hash). If the
hash is sent around, it simply becomes another fixed and reusable
password. (This is discussed further in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>.) For this reason, good network authentication
systems use a random piece of data that changes on every transaction,
often called a <em class="emphasis">nonce</em>. Adding this changing value
into the information that gets hashed and exchanged prevents
eavesdroppers from reading and reusing the hashes.</p><p>





It is possible to use a block cipher in a special way to calculate a
cryptographic hash. When a cipher is used like this, the resulting
checksum may be called a Message Authentication Code (MAC), a Message
Integrity Code (MIC), or a Message Digest Check (MDC).</p><p>





The use of block ciphers for calculating cryptographic hashes is
often seen in older cryptographic protocols. In particular, they
frequently use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) to produce 64-bit
values. Most modern cryptographic protocols explicitly use
cryptographic hash algorithms. One reason is that cryptographic hash
algorithms tend to produce results that are 128 to 160 bits in size.
This significantly reduces the chances of being able to come up with
a different piece of data that produces the same hash
value.<a name="INDEX-2489" />
<a name="INDEX-2490" />
<a name="INDEX-2491" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="appc-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.2.3. Integrity Protection</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2492" />One
of the most important uses of cryptographic hashes is to provide
integrity protection. A cryptographic hash can be used to verify that
no changes to data have been made, but this won't work if you
include the hash value with the data. All someone wishing to change
the data would have to do is replace the hash value with a new value
computed from the changed data. Some way is needed to protect the
cryptographic hash from being changed to the desired new value.</p><p>





One way is to encrypt the cryptographic hash using a public key
algorithm; this is essentially a digital signature, as we discuss
later. Because of the slowness of public key encryption, it is not
always a usable solution. Alternatives have been developed that are
based on the calculation of cryptographic hashes, which include a
secret key as part of the calculation. Without that key, someone
wishing to change the data cannot recalculate a new and valid
checksum. Many recent Internet protocols use a method called
HMAC<a href="#FOOTNOTE-188">[188]</a> for combining a key with a cryptographic hash. The HMAC
technique can be used with any cryptographic hash function that
produces at least 128 bits of output. HMAC is described in RFC
2104.<a name="INDEX-2493" /></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-188" />[188]HMAC, although it is capitalized like an
acronym, does not have an official expansion in the standard. In the
paper originally describing the algorithm, it stood for
"Hash-based Message Authentication Code".</p><p>

<a name="appc-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.2.4. Random Numbers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2494" /> <a name="INDEX-2495" />Many parts of cryptography depend on
being able to generate random numbers, or at least numbers that
can't be predicted. For instance, if you need to send
authentication information across the network in a form that's
not reusable, you will want an unpredictable changing value to add in
with the information. If an attacker can figure out what that value
is, the attacker may be able to use the value to authenticate or to
figure out the authentication data for later use.</p><p>





Computers are very bad at being random because they are designed to
be able to repeatedly calculate the same answer if given the same
data to work with. If you have an algorithm for giving you random
numbers, you will get the same list of random numbers whenever you
run it. This is why random number generators on computers are called
<em class="emphasis">pseudo-random</em>. Knowing the algorithm and the
starting information, and having a faster computer, would allow you
to predict what the numbers were going to be. Truly random numbers
cannot be predicted.</p><p>





So where can a source of acceptable random numbers come from? It is
easy if the computer has some hardware to generate random numbers; if
not, then some random information can be obtained from peripheral
devices attached to the computer. It has to be done very carefully
because it is easy to overestimate how random some sources of
information are. Sampling a fast running clock is not really a good
way to get random numbers because typically only a small number of
bits will change each time the clock is sampled.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-189">[189]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-189" />[189]RFC
1750 is an excellent source of information about random numbers for
use in security applications.</p><p>




</blockquote>





Several free Unix operating systems, including Linux, have special
code as part of the low-level device drivers, which continuously
collects random input events from the keyboard and other hardware
devices and allows applications to obtain a source of random
data.<a name="INDEX-2496" />
