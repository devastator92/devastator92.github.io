<h2 class="sect1">9.2. How Proxying Works</h2>





<a name="INDEX-660" /><a name="INDEX-661" />The
details of how proxying works differ from service to service. Some
services provide proxying easily or automatically; for those
services, you set up proxying by making configuration changes to
normal servers. For most services, however, proxying requires
appropriate proxy server software on the server side. On the client
side, it needs one of the following:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Proxy-aware application software</i></dt>
<dd>With this approach, the software must know how to contact the proxy
server instead of the real server when a user makes a request (for
example, for FTP or Telnet), and how to tell the proxy server what
real server to connect to.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Proxy-aware operating system software</i></dt>
<dd>With this approach, the operating system that the client is running
on is modified so that IP connections are checked to see if they
should be sent to the proxy server. This mechanism usually depends on
dynamic runtime linking (the ability to supply libraries when a
program is run). This mechanism does not always work and can fail in
ways that are not obvious to users.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Proxy-aware user procedures </i></dt>
<dd>With this approach, the user uses client software that doesn't
understand proxying to talk to the proxy server and tells the proxy
server to connect to the real server, instead of telling the client
software to talk to the real server directly.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Proxy-aware router</i></dt>
<dd>With this approach, nothing on the client's end is modified,
but a router intercepts the connection and redirects it to the proxy
server or proxies the request. This requires an intelligent router in
addition to the proxy software (although the routing and the proxying
can co-exist on the same machine).</p><p></dd>

<h3 class="sect2">9.2.1. Using Proxy-Aware Application Software for Proxying</h3>





<a name="INDEX-662" /><a name="INDEX-663" />The first
approach is to use proxy-aware application software for proxying.
There are a few problems associated with this approach, but it is
becoming easier as time goes on.</p><p>





Appropriate proxy-aware application software is often available only
for certain platforms. If it's not available for one of your
platforms, your users are pretty much out of luck. For example, the
<em class="emphasis">Igateway</em> package from Sun (written by Jim
Thompson) is a proxy package for FTP and Telnet, but you can use it
only on Sun machines because it provides only precompiled Sun
binaries. If you're going to use proxy software, you obviously
need to choose software that's available for the needed
platforms. <a name="INDEX-664" /></p><p>





Even if software is available for your platforms, it may not be
software your users want. For example, dozens of FTP client programs
are on the Macintosh. Some of them have really impressive graphical
user interfaces. Others have other useful features; for example, they
allow you to automate transfers. You're out of luck if the
particular client you want to use, for whatever reason, doesn't
support your particular proxy server mechanism. In some cases, you
may be able to modify clients to support your proxy server, but doing
so requires that you have the source code for the client, as well as
the tools and the ability to recompile it. Few client programs come
with support for any form of proxying.</p><p>





The happy exception to this rule is web browsers like Netscape,
Internet Explorer, and Lynx. Many of these programs support proxies
of various sorts (typically SOCKS and HTTP proxying). Most of these
programs were written after firewalls and proxy systems had become
common on the Internet; recognizing the environment they would be
working in, their authors chose to support proxying by design, right
from the start.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-665" />Using
application changes for proxying does not make proxying completely
transparent to users. The application software still needs to be
configured to use the appropriate proxy server, and to use it only
for connections that actually need to be proxied. Most applications
provide some way of assisting the user with this problem and
partially automating the process, but misconfiguration of proxy
software is still one of the most common user problems at sites that
use proxies.</p><p>





In some cases, sites will use the unchanged applications for internal
connections and the proxy-aware ones only to make external
connections; users need to remember to use the proxy-aware program in
order to make external connections. Following procedures
they've become accustomed to using elsewhere, or procedures
that are written in books, may leave them mystified at apparently
intermittent results as internal connections succeed and external
ones fail. (Using the proxy-aware applications internally will work,
but it can introduce unnecessary dependencies on the proxy server,
which is why most sites avoid it.)</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch09-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.2. Using Proxy-Aware Operating System Software</h3>





<a name="INDEX-666" />Instead
of changing the application, you can change the environment around
it, so that when the application tries to make a connection, the
function call is changed to automatically involve the proxy server if
appropriate. This allows unmodified applications to be used in a
proxied environment.</p><p>





Exactly how this is implemented varies from operating system to
operating system. Where dynamically linked libraries are available,
you add a library; where they are not, you have to replace the
network drivers, which are a more fundamental part of the operating
system.</p><p>





In either case, there may be problems. If applications do unexpected
things, they may go around the proxying or be disrupted by it. All of
the following will cause problems:</p><p>





<ul><li>Statically linked software</p><p></li><li>Software that provides its own dynamically linked libraries for
network functions</p><p></li><li>Protocols that use embedded port numbers or IP addresses</p></li><li>Software that attempts to do low-level manipulation of connections</p></li></ul>
Because the proxying is relatively transparent to the user, problems
with it are usually going to be mysteries to the user. The user
interface for configuring this sort of proxying is also usually
designed for the experienced administrator, not the naive user,
further confusing the situation.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch09-7227" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.3. Using Proxy-Aware User Procedures for Proxying</h3>





<a name="INDEX-667" /><a name="INDEX-668" />With the proxy-aware procedure
approach, the proxy servers are designed to work with standard client
software; however, they require the users of the software to follow
custom procedures. The user tells the client to connect to the proxy
server and then tells the proxy server which host to connect to.
Because few protocols are designed to pass this kind of information,
the user needs to remember not only what the name of the proxy server
is, but also what special means are used to pass the name of the
other host.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-669" /><a name="INDEX-670" />How does this work? You need to teach
your users specific procedures to follow for each protocol.
Let's look at FTP. Imagine that Amalie Jones wants to retrieve
a file from an anonymous FTP server (e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">ftp.greatcircle.com</em>). Here's what she
does:</p><p>





<ol><li>Using any FTP client, she connects to your proxy server (which is
probably running on the bastion host  --  the gateway to the
Internet) instead of directly to the anonymous FTP server.</p><p></li><li>At the username prompt, in addition to specifying the name she wants
to use, Amalie also specifies the name of the real server she wants
to connect to. If she wants to access the anonymous FTP server on
<em class="emphasis">ftp.greatcircle.com</em>, for example, then instead
of simply typing "anonymous" at the prompt generated by
the proxy server, she'll type
"anonymous@ftp.greatcircle.com".</p><p></li></ol>
Just as using proxy-aware software requires some modification of user
procedures, using proxy-aware procedures places limitations on which
clients you can use. Some clients automatically try to do anonymous
FTP; they won't know how to go through the proxy server. Some
clients may interfere in simpler ways, for example, by providing a
graphical user interface that doesn't allow you to type a
username long enough to hold the username and the hostname.</p><p>





The main problem with using custom procedures, however, is that you
have to teach them to your users. If you have a small user base and
one that is technically adept, it may not be a problem. However, if
you have 10,000 users spread across four continents, it's going
to be a problem. On the one side, you have hundreds of books,
thousands of magazine articles, and tens of thousands of Usenet news
postings, not to mention whatever previous training or experience the
users might have had, all of which attempt to teach users the
standard way to use basic Internet services like FTP. On the other
side is your tiny voice, telling them how to use a procedure that is
at odds with all the other information they're getting. On top
of that, your users will have to remember the name of your gateway
and the details of how to use it. In any organization of a reasonable
size, this approach can't be relied upon.<a name="INDEX-671" /><a name="INDEX-672" /></p><p>

<a name="ch09-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.4. Using a Proxy-Aware Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-673" />With
a proxy-aware router, clients attempt to make connections the same
way they normally would, but the packets are intercepted and directed
to a proxy server instead. In some cases, this is handled by having
the proxy server claim to be a router. In others, a separate router
looks at packets and decides whether to send them to their
destination, drop them, or send them to the proxy server. This is
often called <em class="emphasis">hybrid</em>
<em class="emphasis">proxying</em> (because it involves working with
packets like packet filtering) or <em class="emphasis">transparent</em>
<em class="emphasis">proxying</em> (because it's not visible to
clients).<a name="INDEX-674" /> <a name="INDEX-675" /></p><p>





A proxy-aware router of some sort (like the one shown in <a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-38052">Figure 9-2</a>) is the solution that's easiest for the
users; they don't have to configure anything or learn anything.
All of the work is done by whatever device is intercepting the
packets, and by the administrator who configures it.</p><p>





<a name="ch09-38052" /><div class="figure"><img height="260" alt="Figure 9-2" src="figs/fire2.0902.gif" width="445" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-2. A proxy-aware router redirecting connections </h4>

On the good side, this is the most transparent of the options. In
general, it's only noticeable to the user when it doesn't
work (or when it does work, but the user is trying to do something
that the proxy system does not allow). From the user's point of
view, it combines the advantages of packet filtering (you don't
have to worry about it, it's automatic) and proxying (the proxy
can do caching, for instance).</p><p>





From the administrator's point of view, it combines the
disadvantages of packet filtering with those of proxying:</p><p>





<ul><li>It's easy for accidents or hostile actions to make connections
that don't go through the system.</p><p></li><li>You need to be able to identify the protocol based on the packets in
order to do the redirection, so you can't support protocols
that don't work with packet filtering. But you also need to be
able to make the actual connection from the proxy server, so you
can't support protocols that don't work with proxying.</p><p></li><li>All internal hosts need to be able to translate all external
hostnames into addresses in order to try to connect to them.</p><p></li></ul>
