<h2 class="sect1">14.4. Common Internet File System (CIFS) and Server Message Block (SMB)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1312" /> <a name="INDEX-1313" /><a name="INDEX-1314" />
<a name="INDEX-1315" /> <a name="INDEX-1316" /> <a name="INDEX-1317" />The Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a
general-purpose information-sharing protocol formerly known as Server
essage Block (SMB). SMB is a message-based protocol developed by
icrosoft, Intel, and IBM. SMB is best known as the basis for
icrosoft's file and printer sharing, which is discussed
further in <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>. However, SMB is also used by
many other applications. The CIFS standard extends Microsoft's
usage of SMB.</p><p>





SMB is normally run on top of NetBT. Newer implementations also
support SMB over TCP/IP directly; in this configuration, it is almost
always called CIFS. Note that whatever this protocol is called, it is
the exact same protocol whether it is run over NetBT or over TCP/IP
directly, and that it was called CIFS even when it did not run over
TCP/IP directly. We refer to it as "SMB" here mostly
because it is used for a variety of things in addition to file
sharing, and we find it misleading to refer to it as a filesystem in
this context.</p><p>





The SMB protocol provides a variety of different operations. Many of
these are standard operations for manipulating files (open, read,
write, delete, and set attributes, for instance), but there are also
specific operations for other purposes (messaging and printing, for
instance) and several general-purpose mechanisms for doing
interprocess communication using SMB. SMB allows sharing not only of
standard files, but also of other things, including devices, named
pipes, and mailslots. (Named pipes and mailslots are mechanisms for
interprocess communication; named pipes provide a data stream, while
mailslots are message-oriented.) It therefore provides suitable calls
for manipulating these other objects, including support for device
controls (I/O controls, or <em class="emphasis">ioctl</em>s) and several
general-purpose transaction calls for communication between
processes. It is also sometimes possible to use the same file
manipulation calls that are used on normal files to manipulate
special files.</p><p>





In practice, there are two major uses for SMB; file sharing and
general-purpose remote transactions. General-purpose remote
transactions are implemented by running DCE RPC over SMB, through the
sharing of named pipes. In general, any application is using DCE RPC
over SMB if it says it uses named pipes; if it relies on
<tt class="command">\PIPE\something_or_other</tt>,<em class="emphasis">
</em><tt class="command">\Named Pipe\something_or_other</tt>, or
IPC$; if it requires port 138, 139, or 445; or if it mentions SMB or
CIFS transactions. Applications that normally use this include NTLM
authentication, the Server Manager, the Registry Editor, the Event
Viewer, and print spooling.</p><p>





Any time that you provide SMB access to a machine, you are providing
access to all of the applications that use SMB for transactions. Most
of these applications have their own security mechanisms, but you
need to be sure to apply those. If you can't be sure that host
security is excellent, you should not allow SMB access.</p><p>





SMB introduces an additional complication for firewalls. Not only do
multiple different protocols with very different security
implications use SMB (thereby ending up on the same port numbers),
but they can all use the very same SMB connection. If two machines
connect to each other via SMB for one purpose, that connection will
be reused for all other SMB protocols. Therefore, connection-oriented
SMB must be treated like a connectionless protocol, with every packet
a separate transaction that must be evaluated for security.</p><p>





For instance, if a client connects to a server in order to access a
filesystem, it will start an SMB session. If the client then wants to
print to a printer on that server, or run an SMB-based program (like
the User Manager or the Event Viewer) on that server, the existing
connection will be reused.</p><p>





In the most common uses of SMB, a client makes a NetBT session
connection to a host and then starts an SMB session. At the beginning
of the SMB session, the server and the client negotiate a dialect of
SMB. Different dialects support different SMB features. Once the
dialect has been negotiated, the client authenticates if the dialect
supports authentication at this point, and then requests a resource
from the server with what is called a <em class="emphasis">tree
connect</em>. When the client creates the initial SMB
connection and authenticates, it gets an identifier called a
<em class="emphasis">user ID</em> or <em class="emphasis">UID</em>. If the
client wants another resource, the client will reuse the existing
connection and merely do an additional tree connect request. The
server will determine whether the client is authorized to do the tree
request by looking at the permissions granted to the UID. Multiple
resource connections may be used at the same time; they are
distinguished by an identifier called a <em class="emphasis">tree ID</em>
or <em class="emphasis">TID</em>.</p><p>





Not all SMB commands require a valid UID and TID. Obviously, the
commands to set up connections don't require them, but others
can be used without them, including the messaging commands, the echo
command, and some commands that give server information. These
commands can be used by anybody, without authentication.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.4.1. Authentication and SMB</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1318" />
<a name="INDEX-1319" />Because
SMB runs on a number of machines with different authentication
models, it supports several different levels of security. Two
different types of authentication are possible, commonly called
<em class="emphasis">share level</em> and <em class="emphasis">user level</em>.
Samba, which is a popular SMB implementation for Unix, also refers to
"server-level" authentication; this is a Samba-specific
term used when user-level authentication is in effect but the Samba
server is not authenticating users locally. This is not visible to
the client. Samba is discussed further in <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch14-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">14.4.1.1. Share-level authentication</h3>





In share-level authentication, the initial SMB connection does not
require authentication. Instead, each time you attach to a resource,
you provide a password for that particular resource. This
authentication is meant for servers running under operating systems
that don't actually have a concept of users. Since it requires
all users who wish to use a resource to have the same password,
it's inherently insecure, and you should avoid it. It uses the
same mechanisms to exchange passwords that are used for user-level
authentication (which are described in detail in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>), but it does the password exchange during the
tree connect instead of during session setup.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch14-17-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">14.4.1.2. User-level authentication</h3>





User-level authentication occurs at the beginning of the SMB session,
after dialect negotiation. If the negotiated dialect supports
user-level authentication, the client provides authentication
information to the server. The authentication information
that's provided is a username and password; the method
that's used to send it depends on the dialect. The password may
be sent in cleartext or established via challenge-response.
User-level authentication is discussed in detail in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, because it is used for logon authentication
as well as for authenticating users who are connecting to file
servers.</p><p>





any SMB servers that do user-level authentication provide guest
access and will give guest access to clients that fail to
authenticate for any reason. This is meant to provide backward
compatibility for clients that cannot do user-level authentication.
In most configurations, it will also provide access to a number of
files to anybody that is able to ask. You should either disable guest
access or carefully control file permissions.<a name="INDEX-1320" /> <a name="INDEX-1321" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.4.2. Packet Filtering Characteristics of SMB</h3>





SMB is generally done over NetBT session service at TCP port 139. It
is theoretically possible to run it over NetBT datagram service at
UDP port 138, but this is extremely rare. As of Windows 2000, SMB can
also be run directly over TCP/IP without involving NetBT, in which
case it uses TCP or UDP port 445 (again, although UDP is a
theoretical possibility, it does not appear to occur in
practice).<a name="INDEX-1322" /></p><p>

Clients of any SMB protocol will often attempt to reach the
destination host via NetBIOS name service as well. SMB will work even
if these packets are denied, but you may log large numbers of denied
packets. You should be aware of this and should not interpret name
service requests from SMB clients as attacks. See <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>, for more information about NetBIOS name
service.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.4.3. Proxying Characteristics of SMB</h3>





SMB is not particularly difficult to proxy, but it is difficult to
improve its security with a proxy. Because many things are
implemented as general-purpose transactions, it's hard for a
proxy to know exactly what effect an operation will have on the end
machine. The proxy can't just track requests but also needs to
track the filenames those requests refer to. In addition, the
protocol allows for some operations to be chained together, so that a
single transaction may include a tree connect, an open, and a read
(for instance). This means that a proxy that is trying to control
what files are opened has to do extensive parsing on transactions to
make certain that no inappropriate opens are late in the chain. It is
not sufficient to simply check the transaction type.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.4.4. Network Address Translation Characteristics of SMB</h3>





SMB is normally run over NetBT, which includes embedded IP addresses
but does not generally use them, as discussed earlier. In Windows
2000, it is also possible to run SMB directly over IP. In this mode,
it does not have embedded IP addresses and should function with
straightforward network address translation.</p><p>
