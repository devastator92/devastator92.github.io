chapter discusses the details of configuring Windows NT for use in a
firewall environment, building on the principles discussed in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>. You should be sure to read both chapters
before attempting to build a bastion host. This chapter is not a
complete introduction to Windows NT security, which is a complex
subject. Instead, it attempts to cover those issues that are specific
to bastion hosts, and that are not covered in most Windows NT
security texts. As usual, we use the term "Windows NT"
for both Windows NT and Windows 2000, except where we explicitly say
otherwise.</p><p>





Just as with Unix, it's impossible to give complete
instructions on how to configure any given machine; the details vary
greatly depending on what version of Windows NT you're running
and exactly what you intend to do with the machine. This chapter is
intended to give you an outline of what needs to be done, and how to
figure out how to do it.</p><p>



















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch12-51816" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">12.1. Approaches to Building Windows NT Bastion Hosts</h2>





There are two major approaches to building bastion hosts under
Windows NT. As usual, people hold very strong opinions about which
one is correct.</p><p>





One method of building Windows NT bastion hosts is to take the same
approach that we recommend for Unix machines: you disable all normal
administration tools, remove the machine from all forms of resource
and information sharing, and run it as an island unto itself, where
nothing is quite the same as it is on the mainland. This is a very
secure approach, but it makes the machines quite difficult to
administer.</p><p>





The other method of building Windows NT bastion hosts is to use a
split administrative network, as described in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Firewall Architectures"</a>, and build the machines as relatively normal
Windows machines that can participate in domains, use standard
administrative tools, and otherwise behave pretty much the way
everybody expects. In this configuration, the machine has two network
interfaces, and services are disabled only for the externally visible
interface. The machine is configured with higher security than normal
but not with the extreme measures that make it impossible to
administer normally.</p><p>





Partisans describe the first configuration as "impossible to
use" and the second as "impossible to secure". The
truth is, of course, somewhere between the two. The first
configuration can be used and administered, but it's difficult
and peculiar. It's not appropriate for machines that need to
change often and provide large numbers of services. The second
configuration can be secured, but it's relatively fragile;
small accidents can make services available on the external
interface. It's not appropriate for the highest security
environments, or environments where there are no other protections
for the machines.</p><p>





This chapter is primarily aimed at the first kind of configuration.
This is the more extreme configuration, and the one which is not
adequately covered by other sources of information. If you want to
build the second kind of configuration, you will follow the same
basic procedures we describe, but you will leave many more services
enabled.</p><p>
