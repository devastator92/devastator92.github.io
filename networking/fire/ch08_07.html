<h2 class="sect1">8.7. Filtering by Service</h2>





<a name="INDEX-573" /><a name="INDEX-574" />Blocking incoming forged packets, as
discussed previously, is just about the only common use of filtering
solely by address. Most other uses of packet filtering involve
filtering by service, which is somewhat more complicated.</p><p>





From a packet filtering point of view, what do the packets associated
with particular services look like? As an example, we're going
to take a detailed look at Telnet. Telnet allows a user to log in to
another system, as if the user had a terminal directly connected to
that system. We use Telnet as an example because it is fairly common,
fairly simple, and from a packet filtering point of view,
representative of several other protocols such as SMTP and NNTP. We
show both outbound and inbound Telnet service.</p><p>





For detailed discussions of the packet filtering characteristics of
other protocols, see the chapters in <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-5361" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.7.1. Outbound Telnet Service</h3>





<a name="INDEX-575" /><a name="INDEX-576" /><a name="INDEX-577" />Let's
look first at outbound Telnet service, in which a local client (a
user) is talking to a remote server. We need to handle both outgoing
and incoming packets. (<a href="ch08_07.html#ch08-18075">Figure 8-3</a> shows a
simplified view of outbound Telnet.)</p><p>





<a name="ch08-18075" /><div class="figure"><img height="168" alt="Figure 8-3" src="figs/fire2.0803.gif" width="459" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-3. Outbound Telnet</h4>

The outgoing packets for this outbound service contain the
user's keystrokes and have the following characteristics:</p><p>





<ul><li>The IP source address of the outgoing packets is the local
host's IP address.</p><p></li><li>The IP destination address is the remote host's IP address.</p></li><li>Telnet is a TCP-based service, so the IP packet type is TCP.</p></li><li><p>The TCP destination port is 23; that's the well-known port
number Telnet servers use.</p><p></li><li>The TCP source port number (which we'll call "Y" in
this example) is some seemingly random number greater than 1023.</p><p></li><li>The first outgoing packet, establishing the connection, will not have
the ACK bit set; the rest of the outgoing packets will.</p><p></li></ul>
The incoming packets for this outbound service contain the data to be
displayed on the user's screen (for example, the
"login:" prompt) and have the following characteristics:</p><p>





<ul><li>The IP source address of the incoming packets is the remote
host's IP address.</p><p></li><li>The IP destination address is the local host's IP address.</p></li><li>The IP packet type is TCP.</p></li><li><p>The TCP source port is 23; that's the port the server uses.</p></li><li><p>The TCP destination port is the same "Y" we used as the
source port for the outgoing packets.</p><p></li><li>All incoming packets will have the ACK bit set (again, only the first
packet, establishing a connection, has the ACK bit off; in this
example, that first packet was an outgoing packet, not an incoming
packet).</p><p></li></ul>
Note the similarities between the header fields of the outgoing and
incoming packets for Telnet. The same addresses and port numbers are
used; they're just exchanged between source and destination. If
you compare an outgoing packet to an incoming packet, the source and
destination addresses are exchanged, and the source and destination
port numbers are exchanged.</p><p>





Why is the client port  --  the source port for the outgoing
packets, and the destination port for the incoming packets  -- 
restricted to being greater than 1023? This is a legacy of the BSD
versions of Unix, the basis for almost all Unix networking code. BSD
Unix reserved ports from
to 1023 for local use only by root. These ports are normally used
only by servers, not clients, because servers are run by the
operating system as privileged users, while clients are run by users.
(The major exceptions are the BSD "r" commands like
<em class="emphasis">rcp</em> and <em class="emphasis">rlogin</em>, as
we'll discuss in <a href="ch18_01.html#ch18-9800">Section 18.1, "Terminal Access (Telnet)"</a>.) Because TCP/IP
first became popular on Unix, this convention spread to other
operating systems, even those that don't have a privileged root
user (for instance, Macintosh and MS-DOS systems). No actual standard
requires this behavior, but it is still consistent on almost every
TCP/IP implementation. When client programs need a port number for
their own use, and any old port number will do, the programs are
assigned a port above 1023. Different systems use different methods
to allocate the numbers, but most of them are either pseudo-random or
sequential.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.7.2. Inbound Telnet Service</h3>





<a name="INDEX-578" /><a name="INDEX-579" />Next,
let's look at inbound Telnet service, in which a remote client
(a remote user) communicates with a local Telnet server. Again, we
need to handle both incoming and outgoing packets.</p><p>





The incoming packets for the inbound Telnet service contain the
user's keystrokes and have the following characteristics:</p><p>





<ul><li>The IP source address of these packets is the remote host's
address.</p><p></li><li>The IP destination address is the local host's address.</p></li><li>The IP packet type is TCP.</p></li><li><p>The TCP source port is some random port number greater than 1023
(which we'll call "Z" in this example).</p><p></li><li>The TCP destination port is 23.</p></li><li>The TCP ACK bit will not be set on the very first inbound packet,
establishing the connection, but it will be set on all other inbound
packets.</p><p></li></ul>
The outgoing packets for this inbound Telnet service contain the
server responses (the data to be displayed for the user) and have the
following characteristics:</p><p>





<ul><li>The IP source address is the local host's address.</p><p></li><li>The IP destination address is the remote host's address.</p></li><li><p>The IP packet type is TCP.</p></li><li><p>The TCP source port is 23 (these packets are from the Telnet server).</p></li><li><p>The TCP destination port is the same random port "Z" that
was used as the source port for the inbound packets.</p><p></li><li>The TCP ACK bit will be set on all outgoing packets.</p></li></ul>
Again, note the similarities between the relevant headers of the
incoming and the outgoing packets: the source and destination
addresses are exchanged, and the source and destination ports are
exchanged.</p><p>

<ul><li>Rule A allows packets out to remote Telnet servers.</p><p></li><li>Rule B allows the returning packets to come back in. Because it
verifies that the ACK bit is set, rule B can't be abused by an
attacker to allow incoming TCP connections from port 23 on the
attacker's end to ports above 1023 on your end (e.g., an X11
server on port 6000).</p><p></li><li>Rule C is the default rule. If none of the preceding rules apply, the

<h3 class="sect2">8.7.4. Risks of Filtering by Source Port</h3>





<a name="INDEX-581" /><a name="INDEX-582" /><a name="INDEX-583" />Making filtering decisions based on
source port is not without its risks. There is one fundamental
problem with this type of filtering: you can trust the source port
only as much as you trust the source machine.</p><p>





Suppose you mistakenly assume that the source port is associated with
a particular service. Someone who is in control of the source machine
(e.g., someone with root access on a Unix system, or anyone at all
with a networked PC) could run whatever client or server he or she
wanted on a "source port" that you're allowing
through your carefully configured packet filtering system.
Furthermore, as we've discussed previously, you can't
necessarily trust the source address to tell you for certain what the
source machine is; you can't tell for sure if you're
talking to the real machine with that address, or to an attacker who
is pretending to be that machine.</p><p>





What can you do about this situation? You want to restrict the local
port numbers as much as possible, regardless of how few remote ports
you allow to access them. If you only allow inbound connections to
port 23, and if port 23 has a Telnet server on it that is trustworthy
(a server that will only do things that a Telnet client should be
able to tell it to do), it doesn't actually matter whether or
not the program that is talking to it is a genuine Telnet client.
Your concern is to limit inbound connections to only ports where you
are running trustworthy servers, and to be sure that your servers are
genuinely trustworthy. <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a> discusses how you can achieve these
goals for various services.</p><p>





This problem is particularly bad for servers that use ports above
1023 because you need to allow packets in to those ports in order to
let in traffic bound for clients. For instance, in the preceding
example, we allow inbound packets for any port over 1023 from source
port 23. This would allow an attacker to run anything at all on port
23 (for instance, an X Window System client) and send packets to any
server above port 1023 (for instance, an X Window System server). We
avoided this problem in our example by using the ACK bit to accept
inbound packets but not inbound connections. With UDP, you have no
such option, because there is no equivalent to the ACK bit.
Fortunately, relatively few important UDP-based protocols are used
across the Internet. (The notable exception is DNS, which is
discussed further in <a href="ch20_01.html#ch20-13126">Section 20.1, "Domain Name System (DNS)"</a>.)<a name="INDEX-584" /><a name="INDEX-585" /></p><p>
