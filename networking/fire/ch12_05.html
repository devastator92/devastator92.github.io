<h2 class="sect1">12.5. Installing and Modifying Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1140" /> <a name="INDEX-1141" /><a name="INDEX-1142" /><a name="INDEX-1143" /><a name="INDEX-1144" />Some of the services you want to provide may
not be provided with your operating system. Others may be provided in
versions that are inappropriate for use in a secure environment or
are missing features you probably want. You will have to choose
servers to provide these services and install them.</p><p>





Windows NT does not have an equivalent to the Unix TCP wrappers
(which provide global controls that can be enforced on most
services). Instead, you will need to secure every service separately.
You should not assume that services are safe; reputable software
companies often ship unsafe packages, and in many cases, their worst
problems are easy to find and repair.</p><p>





Install a test copy of the service on a machine that is otherwise
stable and will not change while you are doing the installation. Use
Find to identify all the files that were changed during the
installation, and check to make sure that those files are acceptable.
In particular:</p><p>





<ul><li>Make sure that file permissions are as restrictive as possible;
arbitrary users shouldn't be able to write to any executables,
configuration files, or temporary directories. If possible, limit
read and execute permissions as well.<a name="INDEX-1145" /></p><p></li><li><a name="INDEX-1146" />Verify the permissions on all registry
entries to make sure that arbitrary users can't change them.
Again, you will probably want to limit read permissions as well. In
particular, many services store passwords in registry keys, sometimes
with extremely weak protection. You do not want these keys to be
readable!</p><p></li><li>If the program installs a user account, make sure that the password
is set to something other than the program's default. If
possible, change the account name to something other than the
program's default.</p><p></li><li>Make sure that all programs are run by users with appropriate
permissions. Do not run services as Administrator unless they need to
be run as Administrator. If you add special user accounts for
services, make sure that they cannot be used as normal login
accounts.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-1147" />
<a name="INDEX-1148" />Note that many services have interesting
interactions with hot fixes and service packs. Services, hot fixes,
and service packs all have a tendency to change system files. You
will need to install them in the correct order to make sure that you
have the most desirable version of the system files. In general, this
means installing the services first and then the hot fixes or service
packs that you need. In a few cases, you may need to install hot
fixes or service packs both before and after you install a service
(for instance, if the service requires a particular service pack, you
will have to install that service pack, install the service, and then
install the service pack you want to run). Extremely rarely, you need
to install the service after the hot fix or service pack (which means
that you will need to reinstall the service if you install a new hot
fix or service pack).<a name="INDEX-1149" /><a name="INDEX-1150" /> <a name="INDEX-1151" /><a name="INDEX-1152" /> <a name="INDEX-1153" /> <a name="INDEX-1154" /> <a name="INDEX-1155" /><a name="INDEX-1156" /></p><p>
