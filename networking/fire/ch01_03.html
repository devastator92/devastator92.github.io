<h2 class="sect1">1.3. Who Do You Trust?</h2>





uch of security is about trust; who do you trust to do what? The
world doesn't work unless you trust some people to do some
things, and security people sometimes seem to take an overly
suspicious attitude, trusting nobody. Why shouldn't you trust
your users, or rich, famous software vendors?</p><p>





We all know that in day-to-day life there are various kinds of trust.
There are people you would lend a thousand dollars but not tell a
secret to; people you would ask to babysit but not lend a book to;
people you love dearly but don't let touch the good china
because they break things. The same is true in a computer context.
Trusting your employees not to steal data and sell it is not the same
thing as trusting them not to give it out by accident. Trusting your
software vendor not to sell you software designed to destroy your
computer is not at all the same thing as trusting the same vendor not
to let other people destroy your computer.</p><p>





You don't need to believe that the world is full of horrible,
malicious people who are trying to attack you. You do need to believe
that the world has <em class="emphasis">some</em> horrible, malicious
people who are trying to attack you, and is full of really nice
people who don't always pay attention to what they're
doing.</p><p>





When you give somebody private information, you're trusting
them two ways. First, you're trusting them not to do anything
bad with it; second, you're trusting them not to let anybody
else steal it. Most of the time, most people worry about the first
problem. In the computer context, you need to explicitly remember to
think about the second problem. If you give somebody a credit card
number on paper, you have a good idea what procedures are used to
protect it, and you can influence them. If carbon sheets are used to
make copies, you can destroy them. If you give somebody a credit card
electronically, you are trusting not only their honesty but also
their skill at computer security. It's perfectly reasonable to
worry about the latter even if the former is impeccable.</p><p>





If the people who use your computers and who write your software are
all trustworthy computer security experts, great; but if
they're not, decide whether you trust their expertise
separately from deciding whether you trust their honesty.</p><p>
