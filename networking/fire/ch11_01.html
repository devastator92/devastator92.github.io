<a name="INDEX-874" /></a> <a name="INDEX-875" /></a> <a name="INDEX-876" /></a> <a name="INDEX-877" /></a>This chapter
discusses the details of configuring Unix for use in a firewall
environment, building on the principles discussed in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>. You should be sure to read both chapters
before attempting to build a bastion host. As usual, we use the word
"Unix" for both Unix and Linux, except when we explicitly
say otherwise.</p><p>





It's impossible to give complete instructions on how to
configure any given machine; the details vary greatly depending on
what version of Unix you're running and exactly what you intend
to do with the machine. This chapter is intended to give you an
outline of what needs to be done, and how to figure out how to do it.
For more complete configuration details, you will need to look at
resources that are specific to your platform.<a name="INDEX-878" /></a></p><p>

<h4 class="objtitle">Useful Unix Capabilities</h4>





Every operating system has certain special capabilities or features
that can be useful in building a bastion host. We can't
describe all these capabilities for all systems, but we'll tell
you about a few special features of Unix because it's a common
bastion host platform:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>setuid/setgid</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-879" /></a>Every Unix user has a numeric user
identification (<em class="emphasis">uid</em> ) in addition to his or her
login name and belongs to one or more groups of users, also
identified by numbers (<em class="emphasis">gid</em>s). The Unix kernel
uses the <em class="emphasis">uid</em> and the various
<em class="emphasis">gid</em>s of a particular user to determine what
files that user has access to. Normally, Unix programs run with the
file access permissions of the user who executes the program. The
<em class="emphasis">setuid</em> capability allows a program to be
installed so that it always runs with the permissions of the owner of
the program, regardless of which user is running the program. The
<em class="emphasis">setgid</em> capability is similar; it allows the
program temporarily (while running the program) to grant membership
in a group to users who are not normally members of that group.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<dl>
<dt><i>chroot</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-880" /></a>The
<em class="emphasis">chroot</em> mechanism allows a program to
irreversibly change its view of the filesystem by changing the
program's idea of where the root of the filesystem is. Once a
program <em class="emphasis">chroot</em>s to a particular piece of the
filesystem, that piece becomes the whole filesystem as far as the
program is concerned; the rest of the filesystem ceases to exist from
the program's point of view. This can provide a very high level
of protection, but it is by no means perfect. Programs may not need
access to the filesystem to achieve nefarious ends, particularly if
they have large numbers of other permissions.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Environmental modifications, such as those made by
<em class="emphasis">setuid/setgid</em> and <em class="emphasis">chroot,</em>
are inherited by any subsidiary processes a program starts. A common
way of restricting what the programs on a bastion host can do is to
run the programs under "wrapper" programs; the wrapper
programs do whatever <em class="emphasis">setuid/setgid</em>,
<em class="emphasis">chroot</em>, or other environmental change work is
necessary, and then start the real program.
<em class="emphasis">chrootuid</em> is a wrapper program for this purpose;
<a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>, gives information on how to get it.</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="ch11-68788" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">11.1. Which Version of Unix?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-881" /></a>Which version of Unix should
you choose? You want to balance what you're familiar with
against which tools are available for which versions. If your site
already uses one version of Unix, you will most likely want to use
that version. If your site has some familiarity with several versions
of Unix, and the relevant tools (discussed throughout this chapter)
and support are available for all of them, use the
<em class="emphasis">least</em> popular one that you still like. Doing so
maximizes your happiness and minimizes the likelihood that attackers
have precompiled ways of attacking your bastion host. If you have no
Unix familiarity, choose any version you like, provided that it is in
reasonably widespread use (you don't want "Joe's
Unix, special today $9.95"). As a rule of thumb, if your chosen
version of Unix has a user's group associated with it,
it's probably well-known enough to rely on.</p><p>





Although Unix suppliers differ vastly in their openness about
security issues, the difference in the actual security between
different general-purpose versions of Unix is much smaller.
Don't assume that the publicity given to security holes
reflects the number of security holes; it's a more accurate
reflection of the popularity of the operating system and the
willingness of a vendor to admit and fix security problems.
Don't assume that proprietary versions of Unix are more secure
than open source versions, either; paying money to a vendor
doesn't guarantee that they care about security, only that they
care about money. Ironically, the operating systems with the most
worrisome tales may be the most secure ones, because they're
the ones getting fixed.</p><p>





Some versions of Unix are particularly designed for security and are
therefore particularly suited for use in bastion hosts.
"Designed for security" means different things to
different vendors. It ranges from relatively minor changes to the
packages that are installed (for instance, the Debian Linux
distribution tries to install securely, and the SuSE Linux
distribution provides a post installation security script) to major
changes to the internals (for instance, OpenBSD has made significant
changes to all parts of the operating system).</p><p>





Several commercial vendors offer secure versions of their operating
systems that are designed to meet government security needs. These
versions usually lag behind the main releases (the government
approval process is slow) and may not support all the add-on products
that the main releases do. On the other hand, the auditing
capabilities they offer are useful for bastion hosts. If you can
afford the extra cost and the delayed release schedule, these
operating systems are a good choice for bastion hosts.<a name="INDEX-882" /></a><a name="INDEX-883" /></a></p><p>
