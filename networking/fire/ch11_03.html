<h2 class="sect1">11.3. Disabling Nonrequired Services</h2>





When you have a secure machine, you can start to set up the services
on it. The first step is to remove the services that you don't
want to run. Consult <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, for more
information about deciding which services you don't want to
run. The main idea is to remove all services that you don't
actually need for the machine to do the work it's designed to
do, even if they seem convenient or harmless.</p><p>





<a name="ch11-3034" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.3.1. How Are Services Managed Under Unix?</h3>





<a name="INDEX-901" /> <a name="INDEX-902" /> <a name="INDEX-903" />On Unix machines, most services
are managed in one of two ways:</p><p>





<ul><li>By controlling when they start and who can use them</p><p></li><li>By service-specific configuration files</p></li></ul>
There are two ways services get started on Unix systems:</p><p>





<ul><li>At boot time from a machine's configuration files (for example
in <em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em> and <em class="filename">/etc/rc</em>
files or directories)</p><p></li><li>On demand by the <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> daemon (which is itself
started at boot time)</p><p></li></ul>
A few services  --  for example, Sendmail  --  can be
configured to run under either or both mechanisms, but most of them
strongly prefer one of the two options.</p><p>





<a name="ch11-3053" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.1.1. Services started by /etc/rc files or directories</h3>





<a name="INDEX-904" /><a name="INDEX-905" /><a name="INDEX-906" /><a name="INDEX-907" />Services in the first category are
designed to run indefinitely. They are started once (when the machine
boots), and they are never supposed to exit. (Of course, sometimes
they do exit, either because they're killed by a system
administrator, or because they trip over a bug or some other error.)
Servers are written in this way if they need to handle small
transactions quickly, or if they need to "remember"
information. Writing them in this way avoids the delays associated
with starting a new copy of the server to handle each request made to
it.<a name="INDEX-908" />
<a name="INDEX-909" /></p><p>





Servers of this kind are started from a Unix system's
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files, which are shell scripts executed
when the machine boots. Examples of servers typically started from
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files are those that handle NFS, SMTP,
and DNS. In BSD-based versions of Unix, there are customarily a few
files in <em class="emphasis">/etc</em> with names that start with
"rc". (for example <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.boot</em>). In
other versions of Unix, there are customarily directories in
<em class="emphasis">/etc</em> instead of files (for instance,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc0.d</em>); the directories contain the various
startup commands, each in its own little file.</p><p>





In either case, you need to be careful to look at all of the startup
scripts and all of the scripts they call, recursively. Usually, more
than one script is run in the process of bringing a system all the
way up. On modern Unix systems, those scripts often call others,
sometimes through multiple levels of indirection. For example, you
may find that a startup script calls another script to start up
networking, and that one calls yet another script to start up file
service. You may also find that startup scripts use mystical options
to familiar commands (e.g., they often run
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em> with little-used options that cause
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em> to pick up configuration information
from obscure places). Be sure that you understand these options and
that you replace any that tell the machine to pick up information
about itself from the network (or from services it normally provides
but that you are going to turn off).</p><p>





Linux and some versions of Unix have a utility called
<em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em><tt class="command"> </tt>that is used to
determine whether or not services are started up. When a service is
installed on a system that's using
<em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em>, a startup script is also installed
and always runs, but the startup script uses the
<em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em> command to determine whether or not it
should actually start the service. Administrators also use the
<em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em> command to change or check the status
of services. Different versions of the <em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em>
system use different methods of storing the configuration status;
some of them create files, while others store the status in the
startup scripts themselves.</p><p>





Some versions of Unix and Linux have a file called
<em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em>. On these systems, the
<tt class="command">init</tt> process uses information in this file to
control how the boot process is performed and to keep a number of
system processes running. Normally the processes configured to be run
from <em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em> allow interactive logins from
terminal and workstation console devices. The <tt class="command">init</tt>
process will start and monitor these processes and, if configured to
do so, will restart them when they terminate or die. Disabling these
processes can usually be performed by commenting out the
configuration line or by instructing <em class="emphasis">init</em> not to
start them at all. If you change the contents of
<em class="filename">/etc/inittab,</em> there is usually a special and
operating system-dependent way to signal the <tt class="command">init</tt>
process to re-read the file.</p><p>





In some versions of Unix, one of the servers that is run from the
startup files is designed to restart other servers if they fail. If
such a program exists on a system, it will try to start the other
servers if they are removed from the startup files but not from its
configuration file. Either turn off this program or be sure to remove
from the program's configuration file any servers removed from
the startup files. You'll notice the program when you work
through the startup files.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch11-3085" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.1.2. Services started by inetd</h3>





<a name="INDEX-910" />Some servers are designed to be
started "on demand" and to exit after they provide the
requested service. Such servers are typically used for services that
are requested infrequently, for services that aren't sensitive
to delays in starting a new server from scratch, and for services
that require a new server process to deal with each request (for
example, Telnet or FTP sessions, where a separate server is used for
each active session).</p><p>





Servers of this kind are usually run from the
<em class="emphasis">inetd</em> server. (The <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>
server itself, because it runs indefinitely, is started from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files, as described in the previous
section.) The <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> server listens for requests
for services specified in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em>
configuration file. When it hears such a request, it starts the right
server to process the request.<a name="INDEX-911" /><a name="INDEX-912" /> <a name="INDEX-913" /></p><p>

<a name="ch11-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.3.2. Disabling Services Under Unix</h3>





<a name="INDEX-914" />
<a name="INDEX-915" /> <a name="INDEX-916" /><a name="INDEX-917" /> <a name="INDEX-918" />As we discussed in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, there are four general precautions to take
when disabling services:</p><p>





<ul><li>Make sure that you have a way to boot the machine if you disable a
critical service (for instance, a secondary hard disk with a full
operating system image or a bootable CD-ROM).</p><p></li><li>Save a clean copy of everything you modify so that you know how to
put it back the way it was if you do something wrong.</p><p></li><li>When you disable a service, disable everything that depends on it.</p></li><li>Don't connect the machine you are trying to protect to a
hostile network before you have completed the process of disabling
services. It is possible for the machine to be compromised while you
are preparing it.</p><p></li></ul>
Once you've set up your alternate boot process, check the
startup files and directories for your system. This should be done
line by line, making sure you know exactly what each line does
 --  including any command-line options.</p><p>





In a perfect world, you would like to disable everything, and then
enable only the services you need. Unfortunately, if you do this, you
may find that the machine is no longer able to boot. It is slightly
easier to work from the other direction by disabling services you
definitely don't need, and then examining the rest of the boot
process and adjusting it slowly so that the machine will always boot.</p><p>





One way to start this process is to take a snapshot of all the
services that are running on your machine by using the
<em class="emphasis">netstat</em> utility. This utility allows you to list
all of the open network connections and, with additional options, the
TCP and UDP network ports that have a service configured to listen or
accept datagrams. The Linux <em class="emphasis">netstat</em> utility has
a very useful feature that allows you to directly list the numeric
process identifier and name associated with each network port. Other
versions of Unix are supplied with tools, such as
<em class="emphasis">fuser</em><tt class="command">, </tt>which will map the
network ports to the numeric process identifier. You can also use the
<em class="emphasis">lsof</em> utility (see <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>
for information on where to get <em class="emphasis">lsof</em> ). Once the
process name is known, it can be used to search through the
configuration files to find where it is started.</p><p>





As mentioned before, some versions of Unix and Linux include the
<em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em> program that can administratively
enable and disable services. The command can be used to test whether
a service is turned on, to list the services that can be controlled,
and to enable or disable services. These systems work because the
startup file checks to see if the service should be run. Disabling a
service can be as simple as using <em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em> to
turn the service off. This is a convenient and standard way to
disable a service, but it doesn't leave any documentation of
why the service is off, and it's very easy to re-enable a
service that's been disabled this way.</p><p>





Although it's more work, it's a good idea to comment out
the code that starts the service or to remove the startup file
altogether. This will prevent people from simply turning it back on
with <em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em>, and will give you a good place
to put comments about why you've disabled the service. If you
do disable services with <em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em>, you should
be sure to keep a list in a standard place that says what services
are supposed to be disabled and why. This will help keep people from
re-enabling them by mistake, and it will also allow you to easily
reconfirm the list if you upgrade, patch, or reinstall software,
which may change the <em class="emphasis">chkconfig</em> status of
services.</p><p>





On other versions of Unix, you will have no choice; you will have to
comment out or delete the lines that start services you don't
need. You will frequently see services that are started after a check
for some configuration file. If you don't want the service to
run, comment out the entire code block. Don't leave the code
active simply because the configuration file doesn't currently
exist and the service won't currently be started. Someone or
something might create the configuration file some time in the
future. Commenting out the entire thing is more secure and less
risky.</p><p>





Commenting out lines is preferable to removing them because it leaves
evidence of your intent. When you comment something out, add a
comment about why you have commented it out. If you delete something,
replace it with a comment about why you have deleted it. Make sure
that the next person to look at the files knows that you got rid of
things on purpose and doesn't helpfully "fix" it
for you. If you comment out a call to another script, add a comment
in that script indicating that it's not supposed to be started
and why. Renaming it or commenting out its contents are also good
ways to help ensure that it won't accidentally reappear.</p><p>





For every service that you leave enabled, apply the same line-by-line
procedure to the service's configuration files. Obviously, you
want to pay particular attention to <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>
's configuration file. On most systems, this file is called
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em>. (On other systems, this file
might be called <em class="emphasis">/etc/servers</em> or something else;
check your manual pages for <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> ). If you have
a daemon-watcher and have decided to leave it on, its configuration
files are also particularly important.</p><p>





This process will need to be repeated if you install new software or
a patch, because sometimes the startup scripts are modified or
replaced. Installation scripts often assume that you will want to run
all the software you are installing, and will helpfully turn it on
for you, in its default, insecure configuration, even when you are
upgrading an old installation on which it was turned off. You will
want to have good documentation about your desired configuration to
refer to when you install upgrades, patches, or new software. In any
case, you should certainly disconnect the system from any hostile
networks before performing any software installation or
patching.<a name="INDEX-919" />

<h3 class="sect2">11.3.3. Which Services Should You Leave Enabled?</h3>





<a name="INDEX-924" /> <a name="INDEX-925" /> <a name="INDEX-926" />Certain services are essential to
the operation of the machine, and you'll probably need to leave
these enabled, no matter what else the machine is configured to do.
On a Unix system, these processes include:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>init, swap, and page</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-927" />
<a name="INDEX-928" />
<a name="INDEX-929" />The three
kernel pseudo-processes used to manage all other processes.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>cron</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-930" />Runs other jobs
at fixed times, for housekeeping and so on.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>syslogd</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-931" />Collects and
records log messages from the kernel and other daemons. If the
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> daemon is only going to send messages,
check to see if it is possible to disable the ability to log remote
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> events.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>inetd</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-932" />Starts network
servers (such as <em class="emphasis">telnetd</em> and <em class="emphasis">ftpd
</em>) when such services are requested by other machines.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





In addition, you'll obviously need server processes for the
services that you've decided to provide on your bastion host
(e.g., real or proxy Telnet, FTP, SMTP, and DNS servers). You will
also need servers for any protocols you intend to use for remote
administration of the machine (usually, <em class="emphasis">sshd</em>).</p><p>





You should audit the configuration files for the services you leave
enabled, to be sure that they are configured appropriately. The
manual page for a service is a good place to find out which
configuration files are used. In the preceding list, we have already
discussed the configuration files for <em class="emphasis">syslogd</em>
and <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>. Checking the configuration files for
the <em class="emphasis">cron</em> service is frequently overlooked.
Vendors typically provide a number of housekeeping functions that are
not suitable for a bastion host. In particular, you should check for
places where the system log files are rotated. You will typically
find that <em class="emphasis">cron</em> will attempt to rotate log files
on a weekly basis and may discard information older than two weeks.
We suggest that you check these housekeeping rules and bring them
into alignment with your policy on how long to keep log
files.<a name="INDEX-933" />

<h3 class="sect2">11.3.4. Specific Unix Services to Disable</h3>





<a name="INDEX-936" />
<a name="INDEX-937" /> <a name="INDEX-938" /><a name="INDEX-939" /> <a name="INDEX-940" />You will want to disable all
unneccessary services, but some are particularly dangerous and
particularly unlikely to be needed on a firewall.</p><p>





<a name="ch11-3174" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.4.1. NFS and related services</h3>





Start with NFS and related network services. You aren't going
to need them. No internal machine should trust your bastion host
enough to let the bastion host mount the internal machine's
disks via NFS. Besides that, there probably won't be anything
on the bastion host that you'll want to export via NFS. NFS is
very convenient, but it's incredibly insecure.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-941" />NFS
services are provided by a whole set of servers; the specific set of
servers, and the names of the individual servers, varies slightly
from one version of Unix to the next. Look for these names or names
like them:</p><p>





<ul><li><em class="emphasis">nfsd</em></p><p></li><li><em class="emphasis">biod</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">mountd</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">statd</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">lockd</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">automount</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">keyserv</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">rquotad</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">amd</em><a name="INDEX-942" /></p></li></ul>
ost of these services are started at boot time from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files, although some are started on
demand by <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>. <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> is
somewhat peculiar in that it is often started at boot time
<em class="emphasis">and</em> is listed in the <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>
configuration file, apparently so that it will be restarted if the
copy that was started at boot time crashes for some reason.<a name="INDEX-943" /><a name="INDEX-944" />
<a name="INDEX-945" /></p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch11-3227" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.4.2. Other RPC services</h3>





<a name="INDEX-946" />You should also disable other
services based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system. The most
critical of these is NIS, a service that is provided by the following
servers:</p><p>





<ul><li><em class="emphasis">ypserv</em></p><p></li><li><em class="emphasis">ypbind</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">ypupdated</em></p></li></ul>
These servers are generally started at boot time from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files.</p><p>





Also disable these RPC-based services:</p><p>





<ul><li><em class="emphasis">rexd</em> (the remote execution service, started by
<em class="emphasis">inetd</em> )</p><p></li><li><em class="emphasis">walld</em> (the "write all", or
<em class="emphasis">wall</em> daemon, started by <em class="emphasis">inetd
</em>)</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-947" /><a name="INDEX-948" />All RPC-based services depend on a
single service usually called <em class="emphasis">portmap</em> (on some
machines it is known as <em class="emphasis">rpcbind</em> ). If
you've disabled all of the RPC-based services, you can (and
should) also disable the <em class="emphasis">portmap</em> service. How
can you tell if you've disabled all the RPC-based services?
Before disabling <em class="emphasis">portmap</em>, but after disabling
what you think are the rest of the RPC-based services, reboot the
machine and then issue a <em class="emphasis">rpcinfo -p</em> command. If
the output of that command shows only entries for
<em class="emphasis">portmap</em> itself, this means that no other RPC
services are running. On the other hand, if the output shows that
other RPC services are still running, you will need to investigate
further to determine what and why. If you decide to provide any
RPC-based services, you must also provide the
<em class="emphasis">portmap</em> service. In that case, consider using
Wietse Venema's replacement <em class="emphasis">portmap</em>, which
is more secure than the versions shipped with most Unix systems (see
<a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a> for information on where to find
it).<a name="INDEX-949" /></p><p>

<a name="ch11-3293" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.4.3. Booting services</h3>





<a name="INDEX-950" /><a name="INDEX-951" />Your
bastion host should probably not provide booting services; nothing
should trust the host enough to be willing to boot from it. This
means that, in most cases, you should disable these services:</p><p>





<ul><li><em class="emphasis">tftpd</em></p><p></li><li><em class="emphasis">bootd</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">bootpd</em></p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">dhcpd</em></p></li></ul>

<a name="INDEX-952" /> <a name="INDEX-953" /><a name="INDEX-954" /><a name="INDEX-955" />These should
all be disabled. The servers for these services are typically named
<em class="emphasis">rshd</em>, <em class="emphasis">rlogind,</em> and
<em class="emphasis">rexecd</em> and are typically started by
<em class="emphasis">inetd</em>. The remaining "r" services
are based on them and will not run without them.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch11-3326" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.4.5. routed</h3>





<a name="INDEX-956" /><a name="INDEX-957" />Another
server that your bastion host probably doesn't need is
<em class="emphasis">routed</em>. This server is started at boot time from
the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files, listens to routing
information broadcasts, and updates the kernel routing table based on
what it hears.</p><p>





You probably don't need <em class="emphasis">routed</em> on your
bastion host because your bastion host is probably located on the
perimeter of your network, where routing should be fairly simple. A
more secure approach is to create static routes pointing to your
internal networks and a default route pointing to your Internet
gateway router. You do this at boot time by adding appropriate
"route add" commands to the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em>
files.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-958" />If you
must do dynamic routing on your bastion host, obtain and use a
routing daemon that will provide some sort of authentication on the
source of routing information. Either it should filter routes based
on their source address, or it should support an authenticated
routing protocol like RIP v2. If you want to use an authenticated
routing protocol, be sure that your routers also support it; if you
want to filter on source address, be sure to actually configure the
daemon to do so. Traditionally, the most popular routing daemon of
this type has been GateD, but others are now available, including
Zebra. <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>, has information on how to get
these daemons.</p><p>

<a name="ch11-3350" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.3.4.6. fingerd</h3>





<a name="INDEX-959" />The <em class="emphasis">finger</em> server
supplies information about existing accounts and accounts on Unix
systems. This server is started on demand by
<em class="emphasis">inetd</em>. The information provided by
<em class="emphasis">fingerd</em> can be valuable to attackers; it tells
them information about potential targets, such as:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Which accounts exist</i></dt>
<dd>This tells them which accounts they should try to guess passwords for.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Personal information about the people with accounts</i></dt>
<dd>This tells them what passwords to start guessing with.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Which accounts are in use</i></dt>
<dd>This tells them which accounts should be avoided, at least until
they're not in use.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Which accounts haven't been used lately</i></dt>
<dd>This tells them which accounts are good targets for attack because
the owners probably won't notice that the accounts are being
used.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<a name="INDEX-960" />On the other
hand, Internet users often use <em class="emphasis">finger</em> (the
program that talks to your <em class="emphasis">fingerd</em> daemon) quite
legitimately. <em class="emphasis">finger</em> is helpful in locating
email addresses and telephone numbers. Instead of simply disabling
<em class="emphasis">fingerd</em>, you might want to replace it with a
program that obtains information from a more basic source of contact
information for your site; the information might include:</p><p>





<ul><li>Your main phone number</p><p></li><li>Who to contact if they have questions about your site's
products or services</p><p></li><li>Sample email addresses if standardized aliases such as
<em class="emphasis">Firstname_Lastname</em> are maintained for users at
your site</p><p></li><li>Who to contact in case of network or security problems involving your
site</p><p></li></ul>
You can provide this kind of generic information to anybody who uses
<em class="emphasis">finger</em> to check on your site, regardless of what
specific information they've requested. The easiest way to
accomplish this is to put the information in a file (for example,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/finger_info</em>) and then replace the part of
the <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> entry for
<em class="emphasis">fingerd</em> that specifies the program to run with
something like <em class="emphasis">/bin/cat /etc/finger_info</em>. Doing
this causes the contents of the <em class="emphasis">/etc/finger_info</em>
file to be returned to anyone contacting your
<em class="emphasis">fingerd</em> server.</p><p>





For example, here is the old <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em>
line from Great Circle Associate's system:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">finger stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/libexec/fingerd fingerd</pre></blockquote>





and here is the new <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> line:</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-962" /><a name="INDEX-963" /><a name="INDEX-964" />If you're going to provide
anonymous FTP service on your bastion host, you need to reconfigure
the FTP server appropriately. You should replace the
<em class="emphasis">ftpd</em> program with one more suited to providing
anonymous FTP service than the standard <em class="emphasis">ftpd</em>
programs shipped by most Unix vendors. (See <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>, for information about providing anonymous FTP
service.)</p><p>





If you're <em class="emphasis">not</em> going to provide anonymous
FTP, you can probably disable your FTP server entirely; it's
started on demand by <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>.</p><p>





Even if you've disabled the FTP server on your bastion host,
you can still use the FTP client program (typically called simply
<em class="emphasis">ftp</em>) on the bastion host to transfer files to
and from other systems. You'll just have to do the work from
the bastion host, instead of from the other systems.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">11.3.4.8. Other services</h3>





There are lots of other services you probably don't need and
should disable. Although the specific list depends on your own
site's security policy and needs, and on the platform
you're using, it should probably include the following:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">uucpd</em></i></dt>
<dd>UUCP over TCP/IP</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">rwhod</em></i></dt>
<dd>Sort of like <em class="emphasis">fingerd</em>, in that it tells you
who's currently logged in on the system</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">lpd</em></i></dt>
<dd>The BSD printer daemon or other printing services<a name="INDEX-965" /> <a name="INDEX-966" /><a name="INDEX-967" /> <a name="INDEX-968" /></p><p></dd>

<h3 class="sect2">11.3.5. Running Services on Specific Networks</h3>





In some cases, you want to run some services that need to respond to
only one network on a machine with multiple network interfaces. You
may be able to limit those services to just the networks you wish to
use them on. Under Unix, this usually means specifying which IP
addresses and/or network interfaces you want the service to respond
to as part of the service's startup options; this will be
slightly different for every service, and not all services provide
this facility.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">11.3.6. Turning Off Routing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-969" /><a name="INDEX-970" />As we discussed in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, most machines with more than one network
interface will automatically attempt to route traffic between
interfaces. You do not normally want a bastion host to do this. If
you are not trying to configure a bastion host that is also a router,
you should turn off routing, which is a three-part process:</p><p>





<ol><li>Turn off services that advertise the system as a router.</p><p></li><li>Turn off IP forwarding, which actually does the routing.</p></li><li><p>If necessary, turn off source routing separately.</p></li></ol>
We discussed turning off routing services in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>. If you have decided to leave these services
running (perhaps you are running <em class="emphasis">routed</em> or GateD
because the bastion host is in a complex and changeable routing
environment), you will need to explicitly configure these services
not to advertise the machine as a router.</p><p>





You will also need to turn off IP forwarding. Turning off routing
services merely keeps the machine from advertising itself as a
router; it doesn't keep the machine from routing packets.
Preventing the machine from routing packets requires modifications to
the kernel. Fortunately, these days most Unix vendors provide
supported parameters for turning off IP forwarding. Even for vendors
that don't, it's about as easy as kernel patches get on
most machines: turning off IP forwarding requires a change in the
value of only a single kernel variable. You need to consult your
vendor to find out how to turn off IP forwarding on your machines.</p><p>





On some machines, turning off normal IP forwarding will not also turn
off source routing; it will still be possible for an attacker to get
packets through the machine. (Source routing is discussed further in
<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>.) If you are not screening out all source
routed packets before they reach the bastion host, you should consult
your vendor to find out how to disable source routing in addition to
normal IP forwarding.<a name="INDEX-971" /><a name="INDEX-972" /></p><p>
