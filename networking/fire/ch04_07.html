<h2 class="sect1">4.7. Non-IP Protocols</h2>





<a name="INDEX-321" />Other
protocols at the same level as IP (e.g., AppleTalk and IPX) provide
similar kinds of information as IP, although the headers and
operations for these protocols, and therefore their packet filtering
characteristics, vary radically. Most packet filtering
implementations support IP filtering only and simply drop non-IP
packets. Some packages provide limited packet filtering support for
non-IP protocols, but this support is usually far less flexible and
capable than the router's IP filtering capability.</p><p>





At this time, packet filtering as a tool isn't as popular and
well developed for non-IP protocols, presumably because these
protocols are rarely used to communicate outside a single
organization over the Internet. (The Internet is, by definition, a
network of IP networks.) If you are putting a firewall between parts
of your network, you may find that you need to pass non-IP protocols.</p><p>





In this situation, you should be careful to evaluate what level of
security you are actually getting from the filtering. Many packages
that claim to support packet filtering on non-IP protocols simply
mean that they can recognize non-IP packets as legal packets and
allow them through, with minimal logging. For reasonable support of
non-IP protocols, you should look for a package developed by people
with expertise in the protocol, and you should make sure that it
provides features appropriate to the protocol you're trying to
filter. Products that were designed as IP routers but claim to
support five or six other protocols are probably just trying to meet
purchasing requirements, not to actually meet operational
requirements well.</p><p>





Across the Internet, non-IP protocols are handled by encapsulating
them within IP protocols. In most cases, you will be limited to
permitting or denying encapsulated protocols in their entirety; you
can accept all AppleTalk-in-UDP connections, or reject them all. A
few packages that support non-IP protocols can recognize these
connections when encapsulated and filter on fields in them.<a name="INDEX-322" /></p><p>
