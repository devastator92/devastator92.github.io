<h2 class="sect1">8.5. Conventions for Packet Filtering Rules</h2>





<a name="INDEX-551" /><a name="INDEX-552" />The rest
of this chapter and the chapters in <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a> show the kinds of rules
you can specify for your packet filtering router in order to control
what packets can and cannot flow to and from your network. There are
a few things you need to know about these rules.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-553" /><a name="INDEX-554" />To avoid confusion, the example rules are
specified with abstract descriptions, rather than with real
addresses, as much as possible. Instead of using real source and
destination addresses (e.g., 172.16.51.50), we use
"internal" or "external" to identify which
networks we're talking about. Actual packet filtering systems
usually require you to specify address ranges explicitly; the syntax
varies from router to router.</p><p>





In all of our packet filtering examples, the assumption is that, for
each packet, the router goes through the rules in order until it
finds one that matches, and then it takes the action specified by
that rule. We assume an implicit default "deny" if no
rules apply, although it's a good idea to specify an explicit
default (and we generally do).</p><p>





The syntax used in our filtering examples specifies the number of
bits significant for comparison to other addresses after a slash
character (/ ). Thus, 10.0.0.0/8 matches any address that starts with
10; it's equivalent to 10.0.0.0 with a Unix netmask of
255.0.0.0, or 10.0.0.0 with a Cisco wildcard mask of 0.255.255.255,
or (if it is a filename) 10.*.*.*. Please note that it is also
equivalent to 10.255.255.255/8 or 10.1.27.32/8. The last three octets
are simply ignored. Although the examples in this book systematically
use "0" for ignored numbers or omit them entirely, that
will not be true of all configurations you see in real life, and this
is a common source of errors.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-555" /><a name="INDEX-556" /><a name="INDEX-557" />Although we try to be as specific as
possible in these examples, it's impossible to tell you
precisely what you have to specify for your particular packet
filtering product. The exact mechanism for specifying packet
filtering rules varies widely from product to product. Some products
allow you to specify a single set of rules that are applied to all
packets routed by the system. Others allow you to specify rules for
particular interfaces. Still others allow you to specify sets of
rules and then apply sets by name to particular interfaces (so that
you might define one set of rules that is shared by a number of
different interfaces, for example, and put the rules that are unique
to a given interface into a different set).</p><p>





Here's a simple example to illustrate the differences. We chose
these systems because they represent somewhat different ways of
specifying filters, not because of any particular preference for
them; in general, other systems are similar to these.</p><p>





Let's say that you want to allow all IP traffic between a
trusted external host (host 172.16.51.50) and hosts on your internal
network (Class C net 192.168.10.0). In our examples, we would show
this case as follows.</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-558" />On
a Cisco router, you specify rules as sets, and apply the relevant
sets to the right direction on the right interface. If your external
interface is named "serial1", your rules would look like
this:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">access-list 101 permit ip 172.16.51.50 0.0.0.0 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 
access-list 101 deny ip 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 
interface serial 1 
access-group 101 in 
 
access-list 102 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 172.16.51.50 0.0.0.0 
access-list 102 deny ip 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 
interface serial 1 
access-group 102 out</pre></blockquote>





The Linux <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> rules (assuming that eth0 is
the internal interface and eth1 is the external interface) would look
like this:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">ipchains -P input DENY
ipchains -P output DENY
ipchains -P forward DENY
ipchains -A input -i eth0 -s 192.168.10.0/24 -d 172.16.51.50 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -i eth1 -s 172.16.51.50 -d 192.168.10.0/24 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -l -j DENY
ipchains -A output -i eth1 -s 192.168.10.0/24 -d 172.16.51.50 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A output -i eth0 -s 172.16.51.50 -d 192.168.10.0/24 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A output -l -j DENY
ipchains -A forward -b -s 172.16.51.50 -d 192.168.10.0/24 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A forward -l -j DENY</pre></blockquote>





The rules for <em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em>, which would be placed in
<em class="emphasis">ipf</em> 's configuration file (assuming that
le0 is the internal interface and le1 is the external interface) look
like this:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">pass in quick on le0 from 192.168.10.0/24 to 172.16.51.50
pass in quick on le1 from 172.16.51.50 to 192.168.10.0/24
pass out quick on le1 from 192.168.10.0/24 to 172.16.51.50
pass out quick on le0 from 172.16.51.50 to 192.168.10.0/24
block in all
block out all</pre></blockquote>





Using Windows NT's Routing and Remote Access Service filtering,
you would add two rules:</p><p>





<ul><li>Source address 192.168.10.0 and mask 255.255.255.0, destination
address 172.16.51.50 and mask 255.255.255.255, protocol any</p><p></li><li>Source address 172.16.51.50 and mask 255.255.255.255, destination
address 192.168.10.0 and mask 255.255.255.0, protocol any</p><p></li></ul>
and then select "Drop all except listed below".</p><p>





For detailed information on the syntax of a particular package or
product, consult the documentation for that package or product. Once
you understand the syntax for the particular system you are using,
you shouldn't have too much difficulty translating from our
<a name="INDEX-559" /><a name="INDEX-560" />
tables to that system's syntax.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-14-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
Watch out for implicit defaults. Different filtering systems have
different default actions they take if a packet doesn't match
any of the filtering rules specified. Some systems deny all such
packets. Other systems make the default the opposite of the last
rule; that is, if the last rule was a "permit", the
system default is to "deny", and if the last rule was a
"deny", the default is to "permit". In any
case, it's a good idea to put an explicit default rule at the
end of your list of packet filtering rules, so you don't have
to worry about (or even remember) which implicit default your system
is going to use.
</p><p>
