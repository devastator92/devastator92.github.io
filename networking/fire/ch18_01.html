<a name="INDEX-1715" /></a>Sometimes you want to use a network
to run programs on a computer other than the one you're sitting
in front of. You might want to run a program on a much faster
computer, a computer with a hardware device you don't have (a
CD writer, say), or a computer that runs an operating system you
don't like enough to have on your desk but that has some
important piece of software. You might also need to administer
computers that it's inconvenient or impossible to get to
physically.</p><p>





You can do this a number of ways. For instance, if the remote
computer supports terminals, you can connect to it over the network
as if you were connecting to it via a terminal. You may also be able
to send a single command to the remote computer for it to execute
(remote execution). Finally, you may be able to get a connection that
includes graphics. This chapter discusses the protocols used for
these various kinds of connections.</p><p>





icrosoft's Remote Access Service (RAS) provides remote access
to a network, not to an individual host, and is not discussed in this
chapter; instead, it is discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>,
along with other protocols used for connecting networks, including
PPP and PPTP.</p><p>

<h2 class="sect1">18.1. Terminal Access (Telnet)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1716" /></a><a name="INDEX-1717" /></a>Telnet
allows a user to remotely access a command shell on another computer.
Telnet is supported by most platforms on the Internet, including not
only Unix and Windows NT,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-79">[79]</a> but even some MS-DOS
and Microsoft Windows systems (which provide access to a DOS shell
via a Telnet server). The major exception is the Macintosh operating
system, which doesn't have a command line-oriented shell to
give users access to, regardless of whether or not they're
local (unless you install the Unix-style development environment,
which gives you both the shell and the Telnet server).</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-79" /></a>[79]Windows 2000 includes both
the client and the server; Windows NT 4 includes only a Telnet
client, but Telnet servers for it are available from third parties or
as part of the Windows NT Resource Kit.<a name="INDEX-1718" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1719" /></a></p><p>

Although remote terminal access is the most common use of Telnet,
most Telnet clients support the specification of arbitrary port
numbers to access text-based TCP services at other ports. This is
useful if you have a service for which you don't want to
distribute a dedicated client; for example, it's often used to
give access to MUDs (Multi-User Domains) and MOOs (Multi-user
domains, Object Oriented), which are multi-user environments for
games, collaborative work environments, or chat areas. Telnet clients
are also used fairly often for debugging protocols that are normally
accessed by dedicated clients. For example, people will check SMTP
servers or verify usernames by using <em class="emphasis">telnet hostname
25</em> to connect to the SMTP server directly on port 25 and
type SMTP commands to it. It's important to understand that,
although you may be using the program named
<em class="emphasis">telnet</em> for these purposes, all it's doing
is opening a simple TCP connection to the specified port number. The
<em class="emphasis">telnet</em> program doesn't initiate the Telnet
protocol (which provides for things like option negotiation between
client and server, line-at-a-time and character-at-a-time modes, and
so on) unless it is talking to a server on the standard Telnet port
(port 23).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-80">[80]</a> This section discusses only the use of
Telnet clients to access Telnet servers.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-80" /></a>[80]Although Telnet does not initiate
negotiation except when talking to port 23, most Telnet clients will
still respond to negotiation requests, which can be used by servers
to detect people using Telnet instead of standard clients (for
instance, people using Telnet to port 25 to attempt to forge
email).</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1720" /></a>Incoming
and outgoing Telnet have very different security implications. Most
sites want to allow their users access to outgoing Telnet service, so
their users can get to command shells and information services
provided via Telnet on remote systems on the Internet. (<a href="ch18_01.html#ch18-83692">Figure 18-1</a> illustrates outbound Telnet.) On the other
hand, most sites don't want to allow (or want to allow but very
strictly control) incoming Telnet access to their site.</p><p>





<a name="ch18-83692" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="310" alt="Figure 18-1" src="figs/fire2.1801.gif" width="475" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 18-1. Outbound Telnet</h4>

Regardless of whether the access is incoming or outgoing, Telnet is a
cleartext protocol (just like most others). Whatever information your
users access or provide over a Telnet session (for example, accessing
sensitive data or providing their passwords for other systems) is
going to be visible to someone snooping on the Telnet connection. The
exception to this is Windows 2000 Telnet, which is discussed later in
this chapter; in some circumstances, it protects the authentication
information, but any other information on the connection will still
be visible. Encrypting versions of Telnet are available, but none are
widely deployed. Most sites that need encrypted terminal access use
SSH instead. (See <a href="ch18_02.html#ch18-14602">Section 18.2.5, "Secure Shell (SSH)"</a>
later in this chapter for a discussion of SSH.)</p><p>





Users should be warned to use different passwords on external hosts
from those they use on your hosts. When they make outgoing Telnet
connections, their passwords may be sniffed. (See <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, for more information about passwords and
password sniffing.)</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">18.1.1. Windows 2000 Telnet</h3>





Windows 2000 provides some features that are not standard parts of
Telnet but that make it somewhat more secure in a homogeneous Windows
2000 environment.</p><p>





When both ends of the connection are running Windows 2000, and NTLM
authentication is possible between them, Telnet can use NTLM
authentication. In this case, authentication will take place outside
the Telnet connection without passing cleartext password or username
information. For more information about NTLM authentication, see
<a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>. The Telnet server and client may be
configured to always use cleartext authentication, to attempt NTLM
authentication and fall back to NTLM authentication, or to require
NTLM authentication.</p><p>





In addition, the Windows 2000 Telnet server can be configured to
allow only users with local accounts or to allow users with domain
accounts.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">18.1.2. Packet Filtering Characteristics of Telnet</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1721" /></a>Telnet is a TCP-based
service. Telnet servers normally use port 23 (they can be set to use
any port number but very rarely use any port but 23). Telnet clients
use ports above 1023. (Telnet is used as an example in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>, so its filtering characteristics are discussed
in more detail there.)</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">18.1.3. Proxying Characteristics of Telnet</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1722" /></a>Telnet is well supported by
proxies. SOCKS provides a modified Unix Telnet client; modifying
clients on other platforms is relatively trivial. TIS FWTK provides a
Telnet proxy server that requires modified user procedures. The SOCKS
proxies should allow you to connect to ports other than the standard
Telnet port, if such connections are OK according to your SOCKS
server configuration file. Almost any commercial proxying package
will probably provide Telnet proxying because Telnet is such a
commonly used protocol on the Internet.</p><p>
