<h2 class="sect1">10.10. Disabling Nonrequired Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-803" /><a name="INDEX-804" />
<a name="INDEX-805" />Once
you've completed the basic process of securing your bastion
host, go on to the next step: disabling any services that
aren't absolutely necessary for the bastion host to provide.
You will want to disable all services except the ones you have
decided to provide, and the supporting services necessary for those
to run, as described earlier. You may not always know which services
are the required support services, particularly because service names
tend to be cryptic and uninformative.</p><p>





How do you know which services to disable? There are three simple
rules to apply:</p><p>





<ul><li>If you don't need it, turn it off.</p><p></li><li>If you don't know what it does, turn it off (you probably
didn't need it anyway).</p><p></li><li>If turning it off causes problems, you now know what it does, and you
can either turn it back on again (if it's really necessary) or
figure out how to do without it.</p><p></li></ul>
Any service provided by the bastion host might have bugs or
configuration problems that could lead to security problems.
Obviously, you'll have to provide some services that users
need, as long as your site's security policy allows them. But
if the service isn't absolutely necessary, don't borrow
trouble by providing it. If a service isn't provided by the
bastion host, you won't have to worry about possible bugs or
configuration problems.</p><p>





If you can live without a service, it should be turned off.
It's worth suffering some inconvenience. This means that
you're going to need to think very carefully about services.
You'll be disabling not just services you never heard of and
never used, but also services you've purposefully enabled on
other machines (and, unfortunately, services you've never heard
of because they're considered too basic ever to do anything
to). Look at every service and ask yourself "How could I avoid
enabling this? What do I lose if I turn it off ?"</p><p>





<a name="ch10-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.10.1. How to Disable Services</h3>





The first step in disabling services is ensuring that you have a way
to boot the machine if you accidentally disable a critical service.
This could be a second hard disk with a full boot partition on it or
a CD-ROM drive with the operating system install disk. It could even
be a second installation of the operating system on the same hard
disk. You need to be ruthless; if you can't reboot when you
delete the wrong thing, at best you're going to be
over-cautious about deleting things, and at worst you're going
to end up with an unusable computer. (These fallback operating
systems are also useful places to copy files from or compare files to
if things go wrong.)</p><p>





Second, you must save a clean copy of every file before you modify
it. Even when you're just commenting things out, every so often
your fingers slip, and you delete something you didn't mean to,
or you change a critical character. If you are using a user interface
to change things instead of directly modifying files, you may not
know what files are actually being changed, so you may need to simply
back up the entire system. If possible, do this with another disk,
rather than with a standard program and a tape; if you have to back
out a change, you will want to be able to replace just the files that
are actually involved, and that's easiest to determine by
comparing things on disk. On Windows NT, you should note that the
registry is not backed up or copied by normal procedures; be sure
that you include it. You will also want to build a new Emergency
Repair Disk (which includes the most important parts of the registry)
immediately before you begin the reconfiguration.</p><p>





When you disable a service, you should also disable all services that
depend on it. This will prevent nasty warning messages and will also
mean that reenabling a service will not result in a cascade of
unfortunate surprises as other services are also turned on.</p><p>





Finally, we've said it before and we'll say it again: you
should not connect a machine to a hostile network until it has been
fully configured. That means that all of your work on disabling
services should be done with the machine either entirely disconnected
from the network, or on a safe test network. The reason that you are
disabling services is that they are unsafe, and if you are connected
to a hostile network, they may be exploited before you finish
disabling them.</p><p>





<a name="ch10-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.10.1.1. Next steps after disabling services</h3>





In general, you'll need to reboot your machine after you have
changed the configuration files. The changes won't take effect
until you do so.</p><p>





After you have rebooted and tested the machine, and you are
comfortable that the machine works without the disabled services, you
may want to remove the executables for those services (as long as
they are not used by other services). If the executables are lying
around, they may be started by somebody  --  if not you, some
other system administrator, or an intruder. A few services may even
be executable by nonroot users if they use nonstandard ports.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-806" /><a name="INDEX-807" /><a name="INDEX-808" /> <a name="INDEX-809" />If you feel uncertain about removing
executables, consider encrypting them instead. You should use a
program that provides genuinely strong encryption. The Unix
<em class="emphasis">crypt</em> program is not appropriate; neither are
many of the available packages for Microsoft systems. Instead, use a
more secure encryption program like <em class="emphasis">snuffle</em> or
something that uses the DES or IDEA algorithm. Choose a secure key;
if you forget the key, you're no worse off than if you'd
deleted the files, but if an intruder gets the key, you're
considerably worse off.</p><p>

<a name="ch10-3128" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.10.2. Running Services on Specific Networks</h3>





In some cases, you want to run services that need to respond to only
one network on a machine with multiple network interfaces. You may be
able to limit those services to just the networks you wish to use
them on. Under Unix, this usually means specifying which IP addresses
and/or network interfaces you want the service to respond to as part
of the service's startup options; this will be slightly
different for every service, and not all services provide this
facility. Under Windows NT, only a few basic services can be
controlled this way. In the Networking control panel, go to the
Bindings tab and set it to show bindings for all adapters. Select the
services that you wish to turn off and press the Disable button.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch10-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.10.3. Turning Off Routing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-810" />If
you have a dual-homed host that is not supposed to be a router, you
will need to specifically disable routing. In order to act as an IP
router, a dual-homed host needs to accept packets that are addressed
to other machines' IP addresses, and send them on
appropriately. This is known as <em class="emphasis">IP forwarding</em>,
and it's usually implemented at a low level in the operating
system kernel. An IP-capable host with multiple interfaces normally
does this automatically, without any special configuration.</p><p>





Other machines have to know that the dual-homed host is a router in
order to use it as such. Sometimes this is done simply by configuring
those machines to always route packets for certain networks to the
dual-homed host (this is called <em class="emphasis">static routing</em>).
ore often, however, the dual-homed host is configured to broadcast
its routing capabilities via a routing protocol such as Routing
Information Protocol (RIP). Other machines hear these routing
broadcasts and adjust their own routing tables accordingly (this is
called <em class="emphasis">dynamic routing</em>). This broadcast of
routing information by the dual-homed host is usually done by an
additional program (for example, <em class="emphasis">routed</em> or
<em class="emphasis">gated</em> on a Unix system), which often has to be
turned on explicitly.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-811" /><a name="INDEX-812" /><a name="INDEX-813" />To use a dual-homed host as a
firewall, you need to convert it to a nonrouting dual-homed host; you
take a machine that has two network interfaces, and you configure it
so it <em class="emphasis">can't</em> act as a router between those
two interfaces. This is a two-step process:</p><p>





<ol><li>Turn off any program that might be advertising it as a router; this
is usually relatively straightforward.</p><p></li><li>Disable IP forwarding; this can be equally easy or considerably more
difficult, and may require modifying the operating system kernel.</p><p></li></ol>
Unfortunately, turning off IP forwarding does not always turn off all
routing. On some systems, you can turn off IP forwarding, but the IP
source-routing option usually remains a security hole.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-814" /><a name="INDEX-815" />What
is <em class="emphasis">source routing</em> ? Normal IP packets have only
source and destination addresses in their headers, with no
information about the route the packet should take from the source to
the destination. It's the job of the routers in between the
source and the destination to determine the most efficient route.
However, source-routed IP packets contain additional information in
the IP header that specifies the route the packet should take. This
additional routing information is specified by the source
host -- thus the term "source-routed".</p><p>





When a router receives a source-routed packet, it follows the route
specified in the packet, instead of determining the most efficient
route from source to destination. The source-routing specification
overrides the ordinary routing. Because of the way the routing code
is implemented in many operating systems, turning off IP forwarding
does <em class="emphasis">not</em> disable forwarding of source-routed
packets. It's implemented completely separately and must be
turned off separately, often by completely different (and more
difficult) mechanisms.</p><p>





Source-routed packets can easily be generated by modern applications
like the Telnet client that's freely available on the Internet
as part of the BSD 4.4 release. Unless you block source-routed
packets somewhere else, such as in a router between the dual-homed
host and the Internet, source-routed packets can blow right past your
dual-homed host and into your internal network.</p><p>





Worse still, source routing goes both ways. Once source-routed
packets make their way to an internal system, the system is supposed
to reply with source-routed packets that use the inverse of the
original route. The reply from your internal system back to the
attacker will also blow right through your dual-homed host, allowing
two-way connection through a firewall that was supposed to block all
communications across it.</p><p>





Fortunately, it is now common practice for firewalls to ignore all
source routing, either by dropping packets with source routing or by
stripping the source routing itself. In addition, systems that will
accept source routes will rarely include them on the return packet.</p><p>





If you are not going to screen your dual-homed host, you will need to
patch your operating system so that it rejects source-routed packets.
Consult your vendor, and/or appropriate security mailing lists
(discussed in <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>) for information on how to
do this on your platform.<a name="INDEX-816" /><a name="INDEX-817" /><a name="INDEX-818" /> <a name="INDEX-819" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">10.10.4. Controlling Inbound Traffic</h3>





<a name="INDEX-820" />As we discussed in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>, many general-purpose computers are provided
with packet filtering packages. Even when these packages are not
adequate for building packet filtering routers, they can provide an
extra level of protection for bastion hosts. If packet filtering is
available to you, you should set it up so that it allows only the
traffic that you intend to support. In most configurations, this will
be multiply redundant; it will duplicate protections provided on
routers, and most of the rules will prevent connections to services
that don't exist anyway. This is a useful kind of redundancy,
which will help to protect you from configuration errors.</p><p>





Packet filters will also keep you from successfully adding new
services to the machine. You should document the filters carefully to
avoid puzzling failures later.</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-821" /> <a name="INDEX-822" /><a name="INDEX-823" />
<a name="INDEX-824" />Some
of the services you want to provide may not be provided with your
operating system. Others may be provided with servers that are
inappropriate for use in a secure environment or are missing features
you probably want (for example, stock <em class="emphasis">fingerd</em>
and <em class="emphasis">ftpd</em> ). Even those few remaining services
that are provided, secure, and up to date in your vendor's
operating system release usually need to be specially configured for
security.</p><p>





For information on general schemes for protecting services in the
operating system you are using, see <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, and
<a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Windows NT and Windows 2000 Bastion Hosts "</a>, as appropriate. For detailed information
about individual services, including advice on selecting HTTP, NNTP,
and FTP servers, see the chapters relevant to the services you want
to provide (for instance, <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "The World Wide Web"</a>, for HTTP;

<a name="INDEX-825" /><a name="INDEX-826" /><a name="INDEX-827" /><a name="INDEX-828" />Now it's time to move the
machine from the configuration that was useful to you when you were
building it to the best configuration for running it. You'll
need to do several things:</p><p>





<ol><li>Finalize the operating system configuration.</p><p></li><li>Remove all unnecessary programs.</p></li><li><p>Mount as many filesystems as possible as read-only.</p></li></ol>
<a name="ch10-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.10.6.1. Finalize the operating system configuration</h3>





Once you've deleted all the services that aren't used on
a day-to-day basis, you'll find that it is very difficult to
work on the bastion host -- for example, when you need to install
new software packages or upgrade existing ones. Here are some
suggestions for what to do when you find it necessary to do extensive
work on the bastion host:</p><p>





<ul><li>Write all the tools to tape before deleting them, and then restore
them from tape when needed. Don't forget to delete them each
time after you're done.</p><p></li><li>Set up a small, external, alternate boot disk with all the tools on
it. Then, plug the disk in and boot from it when you need the tools.
Don't leave the disk connected during routine operations,
however; you don't want an attacker to be able to mount the
disk and use the tools against you.</p><p></li></ul>
You don't want an intruder to attack the machine while
you're working on it. To keep that from happening, follow these
steps:</p><p>





<ol><li>Either disconnect the bastion host from the network or disconnect
your network from the Internet before you begin.</p><p></li><li>Give the bastion host back the tools you'll need to use (as
we've described earlier).</p><p></li><li>After you've finished your work on the machine, return it to
its normal (stripped down) operating condition.</p><p></li><li>Reconnect the bastion host to the network or your network to the
Internet.</p><p></li></ol>
You may find it easier to simply remove the bastion host's disk
and attach it to an internal host as a nonsystem disk; you can then
use the internal host's tools without fear of having them
remain available when the bastion host is returned to service. This
procedure also guarantees that the bastion host is not vulnerable to
compromise from the outside while you are doing the work, since it is
entirely nonfunctional while its disk is removed and not susceptible
to accidental reconnection.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch10-3740" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.10.6.2. Mount filesystems as read-only</h3>





<a name="INDEX-829" />
<a name="INDEX-830" /><a name="INDEX-831" /><a name="INDEX-832" /><a name="INDEX-833" />Once you've got the bastion
host configured, you don't want anybody (particularly an
attacker) to be able to change the configuration. To guard against
this happening, mount the filesystems on the bastion host as
read-only if possible (particularly the filesystems that contain
program binaries) to protect against tampering.</p><p>





It's much better if you can use hardware write-protect; an
attacker may be able to remount disks with write permission without
getting physical access to the machine, but it's not going to
do any good if the hardware write-protect on the disk is on. Many
SCSI disks have a "write-disable" jumper or switch you
can set. If you find powering the disk down and removing it from the
case unacceptable as a way to get write access, you could wire this
jumper to an external switch on the drive enclosure.<a name="INDEX-834" /><a name="INDEX-835" /><a name="INDEX-836" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">10.10.7. Running a Security Audit</h3>





<a name="INDEX-837" /><a name="INDEX-838" />Once you've got the bastion host
reconfigured, the next step is to run a security audit. There are two
reasons for doing this. First, it gives you a way to ensure you
haven't overlooked anything during system setup. Second, it
establishes a "baseline", or a basis for comparison,
against which you can compare future audits. In this way,
you'll be able to detect any tampering with the machine.</p><p>





<a name="ch10-3783" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.10.7.1. Auditing packages</h3>





<a name="INDEX-839" />Most auditing packages have two basic
purposes:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Checking for well-known security holes</i></dt>
<dd>These are holes that have been uncovered by system administrators,
exploited by attackers in system break-ins, or documented in computer
security books and papers.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Establishing a database of checksums of all files on a system</i></dt>
<dd>Doing this allows a system administrator to recognize future changes
to files  --  particularly unauthorized changes.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Several very good automated auditing packages are freely available on
the Internet.</p><p>





How do you use the various auditing packages to audit your system?
The details of what you do depend upon which package you're
using. (See the documentation provided with the packages for detailed
instructions.) This section provides some general tips.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-840" /><a name="INDEX-841" />You will need to do some configuration.
Don't just install the program, run it, and expect you'll
get reasonable results. Expect to go through several iterations of
running the auditing package, getting warnings, and reconfiguring
your machine or the auditing package to get rid of warnings. When you
get warnings, you have to decide whether the auditing package is
wrong, or you are. There will be some cases where the right thing to
do is to turn off checks, but it shouldn't be your automatic
response.</p><p>





Once you've used the tools described in the previous section to
create your initial baseline, store a copy of the tools and these
initial audit results somewhere safe. Under no circumstances should
you store the only copy of the baseline or the tools on the bastion
host. Prepare for the worst: if someone were to break into the
bastion host and tamper with the only copy of the baseline audit,
this would compromise your ability to use the audit later on to
detect illicit changes on the system. If intruders can change the
auditing software, it doesn't matter whether they can change
the baseline; they could simply set up the auditing software to
reproduce the baseline. Keeping a copy of the baseline audit on a
floppy disk or magnetic tape that's locked up some place safe
is a good way to protect against such a compromise. Preferably, you
don't want an intruder to even read the audit results; why tell
them what you expect the system to look like and what files you
aren't watching?</p><p>





Periodically, (e.g., daily or weekly, depending on your own
site's needs and capabilities), audit the machine once again
and compare the new audit to the baseline. Make sure you can account
for any differences you find. Ideally, you should automate this
periodic reaudit so it happens regularly and reliably. Unfortunately,
this is easier said than done. It can be difficult to arrange
automatic audits that can't be defeated by "replay"
attacks. In a replay attack, an attacker who has compromised your
auditing system simply sends you a recording of a prior good audit
whenever your system invokes the automatic auditing capability. The
most practical defense against this is to run your automated auditing
system often enough that it's unlikely an attacker could break
in, discover the auditing system, and subvert it (covering his
tracks) before the next audit runs. This suggests that you should run
an audit at least daily. It may help to run the audit at random
intervals, although it can be difficult to automate this well. It is
better to run the audit at frequent but predictable intervals than to
rely on human beings remembering to run it by hand.</p><p>





If you start receiving warnings from the auditing system and you
decide that they are incorrect, you should immediately reconfigure
the auditing system or the operating system so that the warnings go
away. If you get used to getting warnings, you will end up ignoring
important new messages. Also, if you go on vacation, your replacement
may not realize that the messages are benign and may take drastic
action to remedy nonproblems.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch10-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.10.7.2. Use cryptographic checksums for auditing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-842" />Checksums
are very helpful in auditing. An intruder who changes a program or
configuration file will almost certainly correct the modification
dates afterwards, so you can't use these dates as a reliable
index. Comparing every file to a baseline copy avoids that problem
but takes a lot of time and requires that you store a copy of every
single file, effectively doubling your storage requirements. Storing
checksums is probably your best bet.</p><p>





A checksum is a number calculated on data that is designed to detect
changes to the data. This is useful for a communications channel; if
a sender calculates a checksum as data is being sent and a receiver
does the same, then the two can simply compare checksums to see if
the data was changed during transmission. You can also do exactly the
same checksum calculation for files, but instead of sending the file
elsewhere, you recalculate and compare the checksum at a later time.
Calculating checksums can be time consuming because you have to read
the contents of every file, but it is not as time consuming as
reading everything twice and doing a bit-by-bit compare. In addition,
storing a checksum takes up much less space than storing an entire
file. However, checksums are not full representations of the file,
and every checksum algorithm has cases where it will give the same
checksum for two different files. This is called a
<em class="emphasis">collision</em>, and checksum algorithms are designed
to make this unlikely to occur for the differences they are designed
to detect.</p><p>





In order for a checksum to be useful in detecting unauthorized
changes to files, it must have several characteristics:</p><p>





<ul><li>It must be practically impossible to deliberately create a file that
has a checksum that matches another. This can be achieved by
designing the algorithm so that it cannot be reversed and run
backwards (you can't start with a checksum and use a known
method to create a file that produces that checksum).</p><p></li><li>The checksum must be of a large enough size so that you cannot create
a list of files, one for each value the checksum can have, and match
a given checksum that way. In practical terms, this means that a
useful checksum should be larger than 128 bits in size.</p><p></li><li>If you change something only very slightly in the file, the checksum
must change by a large amount.</p><p></li></ul>
A checksum algorithm that has these characteristics is sometimes
called a <em class="emphasis">cryptographic</em>
<em class="emphasis">checksum</em>. Cryptographic checksums are discussed
further in <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>





You will sometimes hear rumors that these algorithms are vulnerable
to the same sort of trickery that can be used with standard
checksums. This is not true; there are no known incidents where
anybody has managed to subvert a cryptographic checksum. These rumors
are based on three grounds:</p><p>





<ol><li>They're due to confusions with CRC-style checksums, which are
in fact often subverted.</p><p></li><li>They're due to incidents in which people have missed changes
when using cryptographic checksums because intruders have been able
to rewrite the checksum database or replace the checksumming program.</p><p></li><li>They're due to misunderstanding of some technical arguments
about the security of early cryptographic checksums. Such algorithms
are no longer used because of theoretical weaknesses, but those
weaknesses were never exploited and are not present in current
cryptographic checksums.</p><p></li></ol>
It is important not to run checksums on files that are supposed to
change and to update checksum data promptly when you make intentional
changes. If there are frequent false warnings from the checksum
system, you will miss genuine problems.<a name="INDEX-843" /><a name="INDEX-844" /><a name="INDEX-845" /><a name="INDEX-846" /></p><p>
