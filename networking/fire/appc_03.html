<h2 class="sect1">C.3. Combined Cryptography</h2>





The basic building blocks (encryption, cryptographic hashes, and
random numbers) can be put together to create various larger systems
that meet needs beyond simply hiding data. These include digital
signatures and certificates.</p><p>





<a name="appc-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.3.1. Digital Signatures</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2500" /> <a name="INDEX-2501" />What is a <em class="emphasis">digital
signature</em> ? It is the digital equivalent of putting your
signature on a document. When you sign a paper document, you are
permanently attaching something that identifies you with a particular
piece of information. The assumption is that only you can create your
signature and your signature cannot be transferred to another
document.</p><p>





Normal signatures are relatively easy to work around. For instance,
somebody can forge your signature, photocopy your signature, and
stick it on another document, or change the document after
you've signed it. Over the years, people have developed a
number of systems to help prevent these kinds of attacks, with
varying amounts of success. This includes ways of telling originals
of documents from photocopies (ranging from the simple trick of
signing in a pen that's not black<a href="#FOOTNOTE-190">[190]</a> to complicated ways of making documents
that don't photocopy well), systems where you sign and date
every page of a document to keep people from substituting pages, and
ways of physically protecting multiple copies so that nobody can
modify them all. None of these systems is foolproof.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-190" />[190]This is true
only because good color photocopiers are not in widespread use in
offices.</p><p>




</blockquote>





Digital signature algorithms try to provide a much more consistent
set of guarantees, with mixed success. Digital signature technology
combines public key cryptography and cryptographic hashing; public
key cryptography provides a way to prove your identity, and
cryptographic hashing provides a way to guarantee that the
information to which you attached your identity has not been
modified.</p><p>





Tampering is prevented by using a cryptographic hash function to
generate a hash of the document or data. The hash is then combined
with the private key using the digital signature algorithm to produce
something that can be produced only by you and is bound to a
particular piece of data.</p><p>





When you sign something, you use your private key; when recipients
get the signature, they use your public key to verify it. This means
that recipients must have access to a reliable data source that
includes your public key information. This is identical to the paper
versions. Organizations that are serious about signatures (banks, for
instance) keep a sample of your signature on record so that they can
make comparisons. Anybody who can replace that sample can
authenticate as you.</p><p>





A private key is an important authenticator, like a physical credit
card. If you lose control of your credit card, there is a possibility
that somebody else will use it, and you will need to make that credit
card invalid. If you destroy the credit card accidentally, you need
to get a new card, but there's no particular need to make the
old one invalid.</p><p>





The only person who should have the key you use to make signatures is
you -- there should not be any copies of the key. Somebody who has
a copy of the key can pretend to be you. On the other hand, if you
lose the ability to use your key, it does not prevent already signed
documents from being verified, and nothing prevents you from
generating and using a new key.</p><p>





In order to be successful, a digital signature system not only has to
provide an algorithm that lets you sign something, it also has to
provide the infrastructure that lets people verify that signature.
That infrastructure has to support a number of operations. You need
to be able to generate a new key if you can't use the old one,
and you need to be able to cancel a key if you lose control over it.
The process of canceling a key is called
<em class="emphasis">revocation</em>, and it is one of the hardest parts
of successfully designing a digital signature system.<a name="INDEX-2502" /> <a name="INDEX-2503" /></p><p>

<a name="appc-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.3.2. Certificates</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2504" />What
is a <em class="emphasis">certificate</em> ? A certificate is a digitally
signed piece of binary data that contains a set of public keys, some
attributes and values, and an expiration date. Some of the values are
designed to be displayed to humans, and others are intended for use
by programs. Humans are interested in things such as names, the
organization you work for, or your telephone number. Programs may be
interested in things like your public key, your employee number, or
the identifier of your manager. Sometimes values like an electronic
mail address are useful to both humans and programs.</p><p>





A certificate has similarities to a driver's license or a
passport. These physical documents are deliberately made to be
difficult for ordinary people to duplicate or alter because they are
often used when you need to prove your identity. The authorities or
organizations that create these documents usually go to some length
to make sure they are given to the right people. This is because the
organization ends up being a common point of trust between you and
whomever you show the documents to.</p><p>





There is one crucial and very important distinction between a signed
digital certificate and a physical document such as a driver's
license or a passport. The digital signature on a certificate is
designed so that it cannot be forged; it doesn't matter how
good you are with computers or with guessing numbers; your chances of
being able to fool someone with a made up or altered certificate are
impossibly small. There are, of course, ways to trick people into
issuing real documents containing bogus information, and just as in
the real world, it is possible with digital certificates. If the
cryptography is sound, then it is really a problem with people or the
processes used to create digital certificates, not a flaw in the
certificate itself.</p><p>





So who digitally signs a certificate? As in the real world, it is
useful for a common point of trust to digitally sign a certificate.
This might be the organization you work for or some externally
recognized authority, depending on who you want to communicate with.
In order for a certificate to be useful, the receiver has to be able
to verify that it's valid.</p><p>





In order to perform this verification, the receiver has to establish
a connection from some certificate that the receiver knows is OK to
the certificate in question. There may be additional certificates
that must be checked in order to go from the entity who the verifier
trusts to the certificate being checked. The connection between the
common point of trust and the certificate being checked is called the
<em class="emphasis">trust path</em>, and the collection of all the
certificates is called the <em class="emphasis">certificate chain</em>. If
all of the certificates in the trust path are valid, then the
certificate verifier will trust the certificate.</p><p>





This kind of process goes on with physical documents as well, but
it's much slower, and the responsibility is all on the
certificate holder. For instance, if you want to write a check to the
grocery store, you will be asked for identification. Most grocery
stores won't accept out-of-state driver's licenses for
identification; they can't verify the validity of the license.
But if you want to get a local driver's license, the license
bureau will accept your out-of-state driver's license, allowing
you to build up a certificate chain that lets you successfully
authenticate to the grocery store.</p><p>





What can a certificate be used for? A certificate can be used to
provide information about your identity to someone you have not
previously arranged to share information with. Certificates are often
used as a way to verify public keys, for example. But they will work
only if there is a common point of trust between you; everybody
involved has to trust a common <em class="emphasis">certificate
authority</em>. <a name="INDEX-2505" /></p><p>





In order to potentially be able to use a digital certificate to
communicate with anyone alive, you need to have a common standard and
a global infrastructure that supports certificates. There are
currently two certificate standards being proposed for use on the
Internet. One is called Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI), and
the other is called Public-Key Infrastructure X.509
(PKIX).<a name="INDEX-2506" /> <a name="INDEX-2507" />
<a name="INDEX-2508" /> <a name="INDEX-2509" /></p><p>





These certificate formats have some things in common. One common
value in the contents of a certificate is an expiration date. An
expiration date means that a certificate has a lifetime, and beyond
that point, you will no longer believe that the contents of the
certificate are valid. If a key is to be used beyond that point, the
certificate will have to be re-signed.</p><p>





Another thing in common between the design of the two infrastructures
is a way to handle the situation when a certificate becomes invalid.
This is the same problem we discussed previously for digital
signatures; there needs to be a way to make a certificate unusable.
For instance, certificates that contain public keys need to be made
unusable if you want to tell people to stop using a public key,
either because the private key is no longer available (so that
messages encrypted with the public key are no longer readable), or
because somebody other than the original holder has access to the
private key and it can no longer be trusted. A certificate authority
might also want to get rid of a certificate for other reasons (the
authority might discover that the certificate holder lied about some
of the information in the certificate or that the certificate
holder's check bounced).</p><p>





In all of these situations, you no longer want the certificate to be
thought of as valid, but if this occurs before the certificate
expires, there must be a way to get rid of it, which is called
<em class="emphasis">revoking the certificate</em>. You cannot just get
rid of the copy of the certificate that is at the certificate
authority because anyone with a local copy will still use the
certificate, without knowing that there's something wrong with
it. What usually happens is that the key is placed on a special list,
and for PKIX, this list is called the <em class="emphasis">Certificate
Revocation List</em> (CRL). When someone wants to use a
certificate, he or she first checks to see if it is on the CRL. If it
isn't, then the certificate can be used. A revoked certificate
needs to remain on this list until the certificate
expires.<a name="INDEX-2510" /> <a name="INDEX-2511" /></p><p>





The CRL creates a problem; if you give a certificate a short
lifetime, you will need to keep regenerating certificates, but if the
lifetime is too long, you may need to keep a large CRL. The
parameters for these things will depend entirely on the use of
certificates. If you were a university, then you might wish to issue
certificates with a lifetime of a year if you didn't want to
continually sign certificates. On the other hand, you might choose to
expire certificates at the end of each session of classes if you
thought that lots of people will lose their certificates or need them
revoked. An additional problem with CRLs is that they must be
available when performing authentication. This can be difficult if,
for example, your network is not working, and you are trying to
authenticate the instructions to fix it.<a name="INDEX-2512" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="appc-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.3.3. Certificate Trust Models</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2513" />A trust model defines the ways in
which certificate authorities build up a chain of trust, so that two
widely separated entities can find a common trusted authority. There
are two basic certificate trust models. One is strictly hierarchical,
and the other is a mesh.</p><p>





The <em class="emphasis">hierarchical model</em> is like a chain of
command and is frequently represented as a tree (this is a tree as in
the data structure used in computer science). If you pick any two
parts of the tree, it is always possible, by going upwards in the
tree, to find a point where the two parts join. It is a very simple
algorithm, and it always works. It is the model used by the PKIX
standard.</p><p>





To implement such a model globally you would need quite a large
amount of infrastructure, not to mention dealing with the political
wrangling for who wants to be at the top. For this reason, the PKIX
standard allows a number of separate trees to be joined (which is
called <em class="emphasis">cross certification</em>). This means that
there can be a number of trees. However, the top of each tree is then
made to be part of every other tree (making a full mesh between the
tree tops!). This means that if the trees are joined, there will
always be a certificate chain to reach anyone else, although it may
be a very long chain.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2514" />The other model
is a mesh and is sometimes called a <em class="emphasis">web of
trust</em>. In this model, connections can be made voluntarily
between any two certificate authorities. If any two parts of a web of
trust are chosen, there may or may not be a way that they are
connected. This model is used by PGP. In fact, PGP normally uses a
model in which individuals are themselves the certificate
authorities, choosing which other keys they will sign, and which keys
they will trust based on who has signed them.</p><p>





In theory, a web of trust is not as reliable as a hierarchical model.
In reality, when certificates are used to identify individual human
beings, it is not usually a problem. People rarely spontaneously wish
to communicate with strangers. Most interactions are between a known
group of people. If a web already exists between these people and a
new person joins, there will be a way for the new person to
communicate with the rest of the group.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="appc-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.3.4. Key Distribution and Exchange</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2515" />Before you can communicate any data using a
symmetric key algorithm, you have to make sure that all participants
have the same symmetric key. You can't just send out that key
the same way you're going to send the encrypted data because
then anybody who's watching that channel will have the key (and
if you don't think anybody's watching the channel, you
don't need to encrypt the data in the first place). If
you're using a public key algorithm, you have a different
problem; you need to be sure that you have the correct public key for
the entity you want to encrypt things for. These kinds of problems
are called <em class="emphasis">key distribution</em> problems.</p><p>





There are three common ways for symmetric keys to be distributed. The
first method is called <em class="emphasis">manual keying</em>, which
simply means that there is no defined way for the key to be
distributed and some human being has to get it in. The assumption is
that the human will get the key via some reasonably secure method
that can't be compromised by the same techniques that would
compromise the encryption system itself (so, for instance, if the
encryption system is for a network protocol, the key will be sent via
fax, not over the network).</p><p>





anual keying is regrettably common in systems that use long-lived
keys and is bearable only in such systems; if you have to change keys
frequently, having people involved is unusably slow and error prone.
In addition, people frequently compromise manual keying systems (for
instance, by sending keys in unencrypted electronic mail or by
leaving the fax of the key lying around where attackers can find it).</p><p>





Symmetric keys may also be distributed using <em class="emphasis">public key
cryptography</em> ; this simply changes the problem to one of
public key distribution, which we'll discuss later. In systems
that do this, one party decides on a symmetric key and encrypts it
using the other party's public key. As long as the public key
information is trustworthy, only the desired other party can read the
symmetric key.</p><p>





Finally, symmetric keys may be distributed using a <em class="emphasis">key
exchange algorithm</em>. Key exchange algorithms are a special
class of public key algorithms that don't encrypt data but do
allow two sides of a transaction to figure out the same unpredictable
number. The basic principle behind current algorithms is that each
side picks a random number, performs a calculation on it, and sends
the other side the result. Each side then performs another
calculation, still using its original random number, on the other
side's initial result, and the two sides come out with the same
answer, which is used as a secret key. In order for this to be
secure, it must be difficult for an eavesdropper who has the two
intermediate results to calculate the final result.</p><p>





Because public keys are not secret, they are in some ways easier to
distribute than symmetric keys; you can send them around without
trying to hide them. On the other hand, you need some way to verify
that a public key is the correct public key for the entity you want
to communicate with. If an attacker can convince you that the
attacker's public key belongs to a friend of yours, you will
cheerfully encrypt all the data you want to send to your friend so
that the attacker can read it (but your friend can't).</p><p>





There are two common ways to verify a public key. First, you can use
a certificate authority (certificates are described earlier). Second,
you can use external means to verify the key. One way, which was made
popular by PGP, is to verify a key's
<em class="emphasis">fingerprint</em>. A fingerprint for a key is usually
a hexadecimal representation of a cryptographic hash of the public
key. External verification of public keys, like manual exchange of
symmetric keys, is flexible but clunky. In practice, keys that
require external verification are almost never verified. It is also
important to verify a fingerprint independently from the source used
to obtain the public key. For instance, if your software vendor
prints the fingerprint of a public key on the CDs they send out, then
a suitably able attacker could produce similar CDs using a fake
public key and print the bogus fingerprint on the CD.<a name="INDEX-2516" /></p><p>
