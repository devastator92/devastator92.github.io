<h2 class="sect1">3.2. Defense in Depth</h2>





<a name="INDEX-231" /><a name="INDEX-232" /><a name="INDEX-233" /><a name="INDEX-234" />Another principle of security (again,
any kind of security) is <em class="emphasis">defense in depth</em>.
Don't depend on just one security mechanism, however strong it
may seem to be; instead, install multiple mechanisms that back each
other up. You don't want the failure of any single security
mechanism to totally compromise your security. You can see
applications of this principle in other aspects of your life. For
example, your front door probably has both a doorknob lock and a dead
bolt; your car probably has both a door lock and an ignition lock;
and so on.</p><p>





Although our focus in this book is on firewalls, we don't
pretend that firewalls are a complete solution to the whole range of
Internet security problems. Any security -- even the most
seemingly impenetrable firewall  --  can be breached by attackers
who are willing to take enough risk and bring enough power to bear.
The trick is to make the attempt too risky or too expensive for the
attackers you expect to face. You can do this by adopting multiple
mechanisms that provide backup and redundancy for each other: network
security (a firewall), host security (particularly for your bastion
host), and human security (user education, careful system
administration, etc.). All of these mechanisms are important and can
be highly effective, but don't place absolute faith in any one
of them.</p><p>





Your firewall itself will probably have multiple layers. For example,
one architecture has multiple packet filters; it's set up that
way because the two filters need to do different things, but
it's quite common to set up the second one to reject packets
that the first one is supposed to have rejected already. If the first
filter is working properly, those packets will never reach the
second; however, if there's some problem with the first, then
with any luck, you'll still be protected by the second.
Here's another example: if you don't want people sending
mail to a machine, don't just filter out the packets; also
remove the mail programs from the machine. In situations in which the
cost is low, you should always employ redundant defenses.</p><p>





These redundant defenses aren't solely, or even primarily, to
protect from attackers; they mostly provide protection against
failures of one level of defense. In the car example, there's a
door lock and an ignition lock, and maybe an alarm system as well,
but your average professional car thief can break all of them. The
best you can hope for is that the redundancy will slow a thief down
some. However, if you're having a bad day and you leave the
door unlocked, the ignition lock will still keep casual thieves from
driving the car away. Similarly, redundant packet filters probably
won't keep a determined attacker out (if you know how to get
through the first layer, you'll probably make it through the
second). However, when a human or machine error turns off the first
layer, you'll still have protection.<a name="INDEX-235" /></p><p>
