<h2 class="sect1">11.2. Securing Unix</h2>





<a name="INDEX-884" />
<a name="INDEX-885" /> <a name="INDEX-886" />Once
you have chosen a machine, you need to make sure that it has a
reasonably secure operating system installation. The first steps in
this process are the same as for any other operating system and were
discussed in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>. They are:</p><p>





<ol><li>Start with a minimal clean operating system installation. Install the
operating system from scratch onto empty disks, selecting only the
subsystems you need.</p><p></li><li>Fix known bugs. Consult CERT-CC, your vendor, and any other sources
of security information you may have to make certain that you have
all appropriate patches, and only the appropriate patches, installed.</p><p></li><li>Use a checklist to configure the system. <em class="citetitle">Practical UNIX
&amp; Internet Security</em>, by Simson Garfinkel and Gene
Spafford (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1996), contains an
extensive checklist that covers most Unix platforms. More specific
checklists for particular operating system releases are often
available through the formal or informal support channels for those
platforms; check with your vendor support contacts, or the user
groups, newsgroups, or mailing lists that are devoted to the
platform.</p><p></li></ol>

<h3 class="sect2">11.2.1. Setting Up System Logs on Unix</h3>





<a name="INDEX-887" /><a name="INDEX-888" />
<a name="INDEX-889" /><a name="INDEX-890" />On a
Unix system, logging is handled through <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>.
The <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> daemon records log messages from
various local and remote clients (programs with messages they want
logged). Each message is tagged with facility and priority codes: the
facility code tells <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> what general
subsystem this message is from (for example, the mail system, the
kernel, the printing system, the Usenet news system, etc.), and the
priority code tells <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> how important the
message is (ranging from debugging information and routine
informational messages through several levels up to emergency
information). The <em class="emphasis">/etc/syslog.conf</em> file controls
what <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> does with messages, based on their
facility and priority. A given message might be ignored, logged to
one or more files, forwarded to the <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>
daemon on another system, flashed onto the screens of certain or all
users who are currently logged in, or any combination.</p><p>





When you configure <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> to record messages to
files, you could configure it to send all messages to a single file,
or to split messages up to multiple files by facility and priority
codes. If you split messages by facility and priority codes, each log
file will be more coherent, but you'll have to monitor multiple
files. If you direct everything to a single file, on the other hand,
you'll have only a single file to check for all messages, but
that file will be much larger.</p><p>





any non-Unix systems, particularly network devices such as routers,
can be configured to log messages via <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>. If
your systems have that capability, configuring them so they all log
to your bastion host provides a convenient way to collect all their
messages in a single place.</p><p>





Be aware that remote logging via <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> (e.g.,
from a router to your bastion host, or from your bastion host to some
internal host) is not 100 percent reliable. For one thing,
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> is a UDP-based service, and the sender of
a UDP packet has no way of knowing whether or not the receiver got
the packet unless the receiver tells the sender
(<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> daemons don't confirm receipt to
their senders). Some <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> variants can be made
to remotely log using TCP. Unfortunately, you still cannot absolutely
depend on them not to lose messages; what if the receiving system was
down or otherwise unavailable? One solution is to have a local method
to reliably capture all <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> messages. (See <a href="ch11_02.html#ch11-35350">Section 11.2.1.2, "System logs for catastrophe"</a>, later in this
chapter.)</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> will accept messages from anywhere and
does no checking on the data that it receives. This means that
attackers can use <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> for denial of service
attacks or can hide important <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> messages in
a blizzard of fake ones. Some <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> daemons can
be configured not to accept messages over the network. If this option
is available to you, you should use it on all systems except those
that you intend to use as log servers.</p><p>





Despite its weaknesses, though, <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> is a
useful service; you should make extensive use of it.<a name="INDEX-891" /><a name="INDEX-892" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">11.2.1.1. syslog Linux example</h3>





<a name="INDEX-893" />
<a name="INDEX-894" />Most versions of
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> are derived from the original BSD
version. <a href="ch11_02.html#ch11-53479">Example 11-1</a> is taken from Linux, which
includes some enhancements. It allows wildcards for either the
facility or the priority and also allows a facility to be ignored by
using the syntax <em class="emphasis">facility.none</em>. One peculiar
feature of almost all <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> daemons is that
they require the use of the Tab character to delimit fields. The use
of spaces can cause a <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> line to be silently
ignored.</p><p>





<a name="ch11-53479" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 11-1. Linux syslog.conf Example </h4>




<blockquote><pre class="code"># Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.

# The authpriv file has restricted access.

# Log all the mail messages in one place.

<a name="ch11-35350" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.2.1.2. System logs for catastrophe</h3>





<a name="INDEX-895" />One of the simplest ways to
create catastrophe logs is to attach a line printer to one of the
bastion host's serial ports, and simply log a copy of
everything to that port. There are some problems with this approach,
though. First, you have to keep the printer full of paper, unjammed,
and with a fresh ribbon. Second, once the logs are printed, you
can't do much with them except look at them. Because they
aren't in electronic form, you have no way to search or analyze
them in an automated fashion.</p><p>





If you have a write-once device available to you, direct logs to that
device; that will give you reasonably trustworthy logs in an
electronic form. Be sure you can trust the write-once feature. Some
magneto-optical drives are capable of both multiple-write and
write-once operations, and keep track of the mode they're in
via software. If the system is compromised, it may be possible to
overwrite or damage previously written parts of the supposedly
write-once media.</p><p>





Some operating systems (notably BSD 4.4-Lite and systems derived from
it, such as current releases of BSDI, FreeBSD, and NetBSD) support
append-only files. These are not an advisable alternative to
write-once media. Even if you can trust the implementation of
append-only files, the disk that they're on is itself writable,
and there may be ways to access it outside of the filesystem,
particularly for an intruder who wants to destroy the logs.<a name="INDEX-896" /> <a name="INDEX-897" /><a name="INDEX-898" /> <a name="INDEX-899" /> <a name="INDEX-900" /></p><p>
