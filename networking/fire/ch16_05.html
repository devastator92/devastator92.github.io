<h2 class="sect1">16.5. Lotus Notes and Domino</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1595" />
<a name="INDEX-1596" />Like Exchange, Lotus Notes is not just an
electronic mail system; it provides a large number of services,
including calendar management and document sharing. In addition, it
is integrated with a web server, allowing it to provide forms and
documents to web browsers. Although Notes was originally designed to
be a groupware product, enabling groups to work together better,
current versions also use the web server to provide services to
Internet users. The name "Domino" was introduced as part
of this change and refers to the new versions of the server (the
client software is still known as Lotus Notes). When Domino is used
as an Internet web server, it should be treated like any other web
server; see <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "The World Wide Web"</a>.</p><p>





Notes clients can use Notes RPC to speak to servers, but in recent
versions, they can also use HTTP, SMTP, and/or POP3, to speak to
Notes/Domino servers or to other servers. This provides extra options
for supporting Notes clients over the Internet.</p><p>





Notes uses public key encryption for authentication and does not send
passwords across the network. By default, Notes does not encrypt
other information, but it can be set to use encryption for all
network traffic on a given port. This can be forced by the server; if
the server is configured to use encryption, the clients will encrypt,
regardless of the client setting. In addition, users and application
designers can decide to encrypt individual documents, whether or not
all network traffic is being encrypted. Notes can use a number of
different encryption algorithms (RSA for public key encryption, DES,
triple DES, RC2, and RC4 for secret key encryption) and a number of
different key lengths depending on the type of encryption in use and
the location of servers and clients. Encryption algorithms are
discussed further in <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>





Notes documents may contain embedded code in a language called
"LotusScript". LotusScript does not provide any security
controls by itself (it can call external programs and do anything
that the user running Notes can do). Originally, Notes clients would
execute LotusScript programs received in mail without notification or
security controls. Starting in release 4.5, Notes provides controls
on what programs can do, based on the digital signature of the
document containing the program. Configurations can be set up for
specific signatures, for a default that applies to signed documents
with unknown signatures, and for unsigned documents. All Notes
clients should be configured with maximum restrictions for the
default and for unsigned documents.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.5.1. Packet Filtering Characteristics of Lotus Notes</h3>





Native Notes transactions are done over a protocol called Notes RPC
using TCP at port 1352. Connections between servers follow the same
pattern as client/server connections.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.5.2. Proxying Characteristics of Lotus Notes</h3>





As of release 4.5, Lotus Notes clients are shipped with support for
SOCKS v4. Lotus also has what they call a <em class="emphasis">Passthru
server</em>, which is an application-aware proxy server; you
can use this as a modified-procedure proxy by having the client
connect to the Passthru server by name.<em class="email"> </em>You can also
configure a Notes client to tunnel Notes RPC using an HTTP proxy,
either using CONNECT or using a special Notes server that does HTTP.
Some commercial firewalls also include Notes proxies.</p><p>





You can also use a generic proxy, but this requires modifying the
client configuration. Notes clients expect that the greeting from the
server will match the name that they are configured with. You can get
around this problem by using a connection document on the client
which specifies what name to expect.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.5.3. Network Address Translation Characteristics of Lotus Notes</h3>





Lotus Notes RPC does not include embedded IP addresses and will work
without modification through a network address translation system. It
does include embedded hostnames, which may release information that
you expected to be concealed by the network address translation
system. However, those embedded hostnames must not be changed, since
they are used as part of server authentication.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.5.4. Summary of Recommendations for Lotus Notes</h3>





<ul><li>If you need to pass Lotus Notes through your firewall, use a proxy
server.</p><p></li><li>If you are using Notes RPC across the Internet, set the server to use
encryption on all traffic.</p><p></li><li>Configure clients with maximum restrictions on LotusScript in
unsigned documents and documents with unknown signatures.</p><p></li><li>Follow normal recommendations for web browsers when configuring Notes
as a web browser, and normal recommendations for web servers when
configuring Domino as a web server.<a name="INDEX-1597" /> <a name="INDEX-1598" /></p><p></li></ul>
