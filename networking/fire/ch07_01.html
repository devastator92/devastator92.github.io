<a name="INDEX-492" /></a>In
previous chapters, we've discussed the technologies and
architectures that are usually used to build firewalls. Now we can
discuss how you put them together to get a solution that's
right for your site. The "right solution" to building a
firewall is seldom a single technology; it's usually a
carefully crafted combination of technologies to solve different
problems. This chapter starts the discussion of how to come up with
the combination that's right for you. Which problems you need
to solve depend on what services you want to provide your users and
what level of risk you're willing to accept. Which techniques
you use to solve those problems depend on how much time, money, and
expertise you have available.</p><p>





When you design a firewall, you go through a process that you will
then repeat over time as your needs change. The basic outline is as
follows:<a name="INDEX-493" /></a></p><p>





<ol><li>Define your needs.</p><p></li><li>Evaluate the available products.<p></p></li><li><p>Figure out how to assemble the products into a working firewall.</p></li></ol>




















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch07-81643" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">7.1. Define Your Needs</h2>





The first step in putting together a firewall is to figure out
exactly what you need. You should do this before you start to look at
firewall products, because otherwise you risk being influenced more
by advertising than by your own situation. This is inevitable, and it
has nothing to do with being gullible. If you don't know
clearly what you need, the products that you look at will shape your
decisions, no matter how suspicious you are.</p><p>





You may need to re-evaluate your needs if you find that there are no
products on the market that can meet them, of course, but at least
you'll have some idea of what you're aiming for.</p><p>





<a name="ch07-2-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.1.1. What Will the Firewall Actually Do?</h3>





First, you need to determine what the firewall needs to do, in
detail. Yes, you're trying to make your site secure, but how
secure does it need to be?</p><p>





Your first starting point will be your security policy. If you
don't have a security policy, see <a href="ch25_01.html">Chapter 25, "Security Policies"</a>,
for some suggestions on how to go about setting one up. You
can't just do without a policy because a firewall is an
enforcement device; if you didn't have a policy before, you do
once you have a firewall in place, and it may not be a policy that
meets your needs.</p><p>





<a name="ch07-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.1.1. What services do you need to offer?</h3>





You need to know what services are going to go between your site and
the Internet. What will your users do on the Internet? Are you going
to offer any services to users on the Internet (for instance, will
you have a web site)? Are you going to let your users come into your
site from the Internet (if not, how are you providing your users with
remote access)? Do you have special relationships with other
companies that you're going to need to provide services for?</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-4-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.1.2. How secure do you need to be?</h3>





any decisions have to do with relative levels of security. Are you
trying to protect the world from destruction by protecting nuclear
secrets, or do you want to keep from looking silly? Note that looking
silly is not necessarily a trivial problem; if you look silly on the
front page of a major newspaper, it can be a real disaster for the
organization, at least. Many banks and financial institutions regard
being "above the fold" (in the top half of the front page
of the newspaper) as a significantly worse problem than losing money.
One large organization in a small country found that any time they
appeared on the front page of the newspaper looking silly, their
nation's currency dropped in value. You need to know what level
of security you're aiming for.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-5-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.1.3. How much usage will there be?</h3>





What kinds of network lines do you have? How many users will you
have, and what will they do?</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-6-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.1.4. How much reliability do you need?</h3>





If you are cut off from the network, what will happen? Will it be an
inconvenience or a disaster?</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch07-7-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.1.2. What Are Your Constraints?</h3>





Once you've determined what you need the firewall to do, your
next job is to determine what the limits are.</p><p>





<a name="ch07-8-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.2.1. What budget do you have available?</h3>





How much money can you spend, and what can you spend it on? Does
personnel time count in the budget? How about consulting time? If you
use a machine that you already own, what does that do to your budget?
(Can you use one somebody else has and make his or her budget pay to
replace it?) The budget is often the most visible constraint, but it
tends to be the most flexible as well (as long as the organization
you are building the firewall for actually has money somewhere).</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-9-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.2.2. What personnel do you have available?</h3>





How many people do you have and what do they know? Personnel is much
harder to change than budget -- even if you get agreement to hire
people, you have to find them and integrate them. Therefore, your
first effort should be to fit the firewall to the available
resources. If you have 47 Windows NT administrators and one Unix
person, start looking at Windows NT-based firewalls. If you have only
one person to run the firewall, and that's in addition to a
full-time job he or she is already doing, get a commercial firewall
and a consultant to install it.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-10-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.1.2.3. What is your environment like?</h3>





Do you have political constraints? Are there forbidden operating
systems or vendors, or preferred ones? It is sometimes possible to
work around these, but not always; for instance, if you work for a
company that sells firewalls, it is probably never going to be
acceptable to run somebody else's firewall anywhere visible.</p><p>





What country or countries are you going to need to install the
firewall in? Firewalls often involve encryption technology, and laws
about encryption and its export and import vary from country to
country. If you are going to need to install multiple firewalls in
different countries, you may need to use the lowest common
denominator or develop an exception policy and strategy to deal with
the situation.</p><p>
