It is scarcely possible to enter a bookstore, read a magazine or a
newspaper, or listen to a news broadcast without seeing or hearing
something about the Internet in some guise. It's become so
popular that no advertisement is complete without a reference to a
web page. While nontechnical publications are obsessed with the
Internet, the technical publications have moved on and are obsessed
with security. It's a logical progression; once the first
excitement of having a superhighway in your neighborhood wears off,
you're bound to notice that not only does it let you travel, it
lets a very large number of strangers show up where you are, and not
all of them are people you would have invited.</p><p>





Both views are true: The Internet is a marvelous technological
advance that provides access to information, and the ability to
publish information, in revolutionary ways. But it's also a
major danger that provides the ability to pollute and destroy
information in revolutionary ways. This book is about one way to
balance the advantages and the risks  --  to take part in the
Internet while still protecting yourself.</p><p>





Later in this chapter, we describe different models of security that
people have used to protect their data and resources on the Internet.
Our emphasis in this book is on the network security model and, in
particular, the use of Internet firewalls. A firewall is a form of
protection that allows a network to connect to the Internet while
maintaining a degree of security. The section later in this chapter
called "What is an Internet Firewall?" describes the
basics of firewalls and summarizes what they can  --  and cannot
 --  do to help make your site secure. Before we discuss what you
can do with a firewall, though, we want to describe briefly why you
need one. What are you protecting on your systems? What types of
attacks and attackers are common? What types of security can you use
to protect your site?</p><p>



















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch01-212" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">1.1. What Are You Trying to Protect?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-5" /></a>A firewall is basically a protective
device. If you are building a firewall, the first thing you need to
worry about is what you're trying to protect. When you connect
to the Internet, you're putting three things at risk:</p><p>





<ul><li>Your data: the information you keep on the computers</p><p></li><li>Your resources: the computers themselves<p></p></li><li><p>Your reputation</p></li></ul>
<a name="ch01-225" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.1. Your Data</h3>





<a name="INDEX-6" /></a>Your data has three
separate characteristics that need to be protected:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Secrecy</em></i></dt>
<dd>You might not want other people to know it.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Integrity</em></i></dt>
<dd>You probably don't want other people to change it.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Availability</em></i></dt>
<dd>You almost certainly want to be able to use it yourself.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





People tend to focus on the risks associated with secrecy, and
it's true that those are usually large risks. Many
organizations have some of their most important secrets  --  the
designs for their products, financial records, or student records
 --  on their computers. On the other hand, you may find that at
your site it is relatively easy to separate the machines containing
this kind of highly secret data from the machines that connect to the
Internet. (Or you may not; you can't do Internet electronic
commerce without having information about orders and money pass
through Internet-accessible machines.)</p><p>





Suppose that you <em class="emphasis">can</em> separate your data in this
way, and that none of the information that is Internet accessible is
secret. In that case, why should you worry about security? Because
secrecy isn't the only thing you're trying to protect.
You still need to worry about integrity and availability. After all,
if your data isn't secret, and if you don't mind its
being changed, and if you don't care whether or not anybody can
get to it, why are you wasting disk space on it?</p><p>





Even if your data isn't particularly secret, you'll
suffer the consequences if it's destroyed or modified. Some of
these consequences have readily calculable costs: if you lose data,
you'll have to pay to have it reconstructed; if you were
planning to sell that data in some form, you'll have lost sales
regardless of whether the data is something you sell directly, the
designs from which you build things, or the code for a software
product. Intangible costs are also associated with any security
incident. The most serious is the loss of confidence (user
confidence, customer confidence, investor confidence, staff
confidence, student confidence, public confidence) in your systems
and data and, consequently, a loss of confidence in your
organization.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-244" /></a><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Has Your Data Been Modified?</h4>





Computer security incidents are different from many other types of
crimes because detection is unusually difficult. Sometimes, it may
take a long time to find out that someone has broken into your site.
Sometimes, you'll never know. Even if somebody breaks in but
doesn't actually <em class="emphasis">do</em> anything to your
system or data, you'll probably lose time (hours or days) while
you verify that the intruder didn't do anything. In a lot of
ways, a brute-force trash-everything attack is a lot easier to deal
with than a break-in by somebody who doesn't appear to damage
your system. If the intruder trashes everything, you bite the bullet,
restore from backups, and get on with your life. But if the intruder
doesn't appear to have done anything, you spend a lot of time
second-guessing yourself, wondering what he or she might have done to
your system or data. The intruder almost certainly has done
something -- most intruders will start by making sure that they
have a way to get back in, before they do anything else.</p><p>





Although this book is primarily about preventing security incidents,
<a href="ch27_01.html">Chapter 27, "Responding to  Security Incidents"</a> supplies some general guidelines for
detecting, investigating, and recovering from security incidents.</p><p>

<a name="ch01-250" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.2. Your Resources</h3>





<a name="INDEX-7" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-8" /></a>Even if you have data you don't care
about  --  if you enjoy reinstalling your operating system every
week because it exercises the disks, or something like that  -- 
if other people are going to use your computers, you probably would
like to benefit from this use in some way. Most people want to use
their own computers, or they want to charge other people for using
them. Even people who give away computer time and disk space usually
expect to get good publicity and thanks for it; they aren't
going to get it from intruders. You spend good time and money on your
computing resources, and it is your right to determine how they are
used.</p><p>





Intruders often argue that they are using only excess resources; as a
consequence, their intrusions don't cost their victims
anything. There are two problems with this argument.</p><p>





First, it's impossible for an intruder to determine
successfully what resources are excess and use only those. It may
look as if your system has oceans of empty disk space and hours of
unused computing time; in fact, though, you might be just about to
start computing animation sequences that are going to use every bit
and every microsecond. An intruder can't give back your
resources when you want them. (Along the same lines, I don't
ordinarily use my car between midnight and 6 A.M., but that
doesn't mean I'm willing to lend it to you without being
asked. What if I have an early morning flight the next day, or what
if I'm called out to deal with an emergency?)</p><p>





Second, it's your right to use your resources the way you want
to, even if you merely feel some sort of Zen joy at the sight of
empty disk space, or if you like the way the blinky lights look when
nothing's happening on your computer. Computing resources are
not natural resources that belong by right to the world at large, nor
are they limited resources that are wasted or destroyed if
they're not used.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-265" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.3. Your Reputation</h3>





<a name="INDEX-9" /></a>An intruder
appears on the Internet with your identity. Anything he or she does
appears to come from you. What are the consequences?</p><p>





ost of the time, the consequences are simply that other sites
 --  or law enforcement agencies  --  start calling you to ask
why you're trying to break into their systems. (This
isn't as rare an occurrence as it may seem. One site got
serious about security when its system administration staff added a
line item to their time cards for conversations with the FBI about
break-in attempts originating from their site.)</p><p>





Sometimes, such impostors cost you a lot more than lost time. An
intruder who actively dislikes you, or simply takes pleasure in
making life difficult for strangers, may change your web site, send
electronic mail, or post news messages that purport to come from you.
Generally, people who choose to do this aim for maximum hatefulness,
rather than believability, but even if only a few people believe
these messages, the cleanup can be long and humiliating. Anything
even remotely believable can do permanent damage to your reputation.</p><p>





A few years ago, an impostor posing as a Texas A&amp;M professor sent
out hate email containing racist comments to thousands of recipients.
The impostor was never found, and the professor is still dealing with
the repercussions of the forged messages. In another case, a student
at Dartmouth sent out email over the signature of a professor late
one night during exam period. Claiming a family emergency, the forged
email canceled the next day's exam, and only a few students
showed up.</p><p>





It's possible to forge electronic mail or news without gaining
access to a site, but it's much easier to show that a message
is a forgery if it's generated from outside the forged site.
The messages coming from an intruder who has gained access to your
site will look exactly like yours because they <em class="emphasis">are
</em>yours. An intruder will also have access to all kinds of
details that an external forger won't. For example, an intruder
has all of your mailing lists available and knows exactly who you
send mail to.</p><p>





Currently, attacks that replace web sites are very popular; one list
shows more than 160 successful attacks where sites were replaced, in
18 countries, in a single month. Many of those attacks simply
replaced the sites with boasting by the attackers, but a significant
portion of them were directed at the content of the sites. A site
that should have touted Al Gore's suitability for the U.S.
presidency was replaced by a similar anti-Gore site, for instance;
political movements in Peru, Mexico, and China put up slogans; and
there's no need to feel safe merely because your site concerns
frivolity, as pop stars, Pro Wrestling, and the Boston Lyric Opera
all suffered as well.</p><p>





Even if an intruder doesn't use your identity, a break-in at
your site isn't good for your reputation. It shakes
people's confidence in your organization. In addition, most
intruders will attempt to go from your machines to others, which is
going to make their next victims think of your site as a platform for
computer criminals. Many intruders will also use compromised sites as
distribution sites for pirated software, pornography, and/or other
stolen information, which is not going to endear you to many folks
either. Whether or not it's your fault, having your name linked
to other intrusions, software piracy, and pornography is hard to
recover from. <a name="INDEX-10" /></a></p><p>
