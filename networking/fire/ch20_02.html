<h2 class="sect1">20.2. Network Information Service (NIS)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1877" /><a name="INDEX-1878" />NIS<a href="#FOOTNOTE-120">[120]</a> is a protocol
primarily used under Unix and designed to provide distributed access
to centralized administrative information (such as host tables,
password files, site-wide email aliases, and so on) shared by
machines at a site. The advantage of NIS over DNS for hostname
resolution on a local area network is that NIS is a broadcast-based
protocol; clients do not have to have all of the configuration
information necessary for them to use DNS. In addition, having a
unified mechanism that distributes all of the administrative
information simplifies site administration.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-120" />[120]NIS was formerly known as Yellow Pages (YP), and some commands
still preserve this abbreviation.</p><p>




</blockquote>





<a name="INDEX-1879" />The main problem with NIS is that its
security isn't good enough to adequately protect some of the
data it contains. In particular, a site's NIS servers generally
contain the site's shared password file (equivalent to the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> file on a single system), complete
with encrypted passwords. All you need to get data from an NIS server
is the NIS domain name with which the data is associated. An attacker
who can talk to a site's NIS server, and who can guess what the
site has chosen as its NIS domain name (often the same as, or a
derivative of, its regular Internet domain name), can request any
information the server has. If the attacker gets the shared password
file, these passwords can be cracked at the attacker's leisure.
You therefore do not want to allow NIS requests inbound.</p><p>





<a name="ch20-14-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
NIS transfers may include the encrypted passwords even if the
machines are configured to use shadow passwords and the encrypted
passwords are not readable on the NIS server. If NIS transfers do not
include encrypted passwords, they cannot be used for authentication,
so implementations that close this hole simply do not allow you to
use both NIS and shadow passwords.</p><p>




</blockquote>

There is no reason to allow NIS requests outbound because most of the
information provided is local to an individual site, and most NIS
servers will act as gateways to DNS for external hostname information
when correctly configured.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1880" />A revised version of
NIS, called NIS+, is available from some vendors. (It is the default
version used on Suns.) NIS+ has not achieved wide acceptance, partly
because of licensing and compatibility issues, but mostly because the
majority of sites have managed to work around the deficiencies of NIS
already, and therefore aren't motivated to switch to something
new. NIS+ improves security only if it is configured so that it will
not support NIS If you configure NIS+ to support NIS clients (and
because few NIS+ clients are available, most NIS+ sites do use it in
this mode), it is no more secure than original NIS.</p><p>





A few NIS servers (notably Sun's) support a configuration file
called <em class="emphasis">securenets</em>, which allows you to use IP
address authentication to control which hosts your NIS server will
release data to. This is an order of magnitude improvement in NIS
security. It changes NIS attacks from guessing games (guess the
domain name and the NIS server, and you get a free prize) to
requiring you to do all the same guessing and then make a serious
effort to determine what addresses the NIS server will respond to and
forge packets from them. Unfortunately, an order of magnitude is
probably not enough of an improvement for data as crucial as your
encrypted passwords. While <em class="emphasis">securenets</em> (if you
have it available) will protect you from casual attackers who want to
get into any site they can, it will not protect you from an attacker
who knows your site and who wants to attack it in particular. The
trick, then, is to prevent an attacker from talking to your NIS
servers.</p><p>





NIS is an Sun RPC-based service, generally provided over UDP.
Although NIS is an especially vulnerable service, it is otherwise the
same as every other RPC-based service. We do not know of special
proxies or packet filters for it. NIS+ may be provided over normal
RPC, but this removes much of its extra security; by default,
it's run over Secure RPC. The packet filtering, proxying, and
network address translation characteristics of RPC and Secure RPC are
discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





NIS clients may also use additional means to find servers. Older
clients will do this via broadcast; newer ones will use multicast
instead. Whichever method is used by clients, if you want NIS to work
through a firewall, you will need to either make certain that the
relevant queries are passed to the server, or explicitly configure
clients with a server name.</p><p>
