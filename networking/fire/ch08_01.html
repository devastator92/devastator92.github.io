<a name="INDEX-497" /></a><a name="INDEX-498" /></a><a name="INDEX-499" /></a>Packet
filtering is a network security mechanism that works by controlling
what data can flow to and from a network.
<a name="INDEX-500" /></a><a name="INDEX-501" /></a><a name="INDEX-502" /></a>The
basic device that interconnects IP networks is called a
<em class="emphasis">router</em>. A router may be a dedicated piece of
hardware that has no other purpose, or it may be a piece of software
that runs on a general-purpose computer running Unix, Windows NT, or
another operating system (MS-DOS, Windows 95/98, Macintosh, or
other). Packets traversing an internetwork (a network of networks)
travel from router to router until they reach their destination. The
Internet itself is sort of the granddaddy of internetworks  -- 
the ultimate "network of networks".</p><p>





A router has to make a routing decision about each packet it
receives; it has to decide how to send that packet on towards its
ultimate destination. In general, a packet carries no information to
help the router in this decision, other than the IP address of the
packet's ultimate destination. The packet tells the router
where it wants to go but not how to get there. Routers communicate
with each other using <em class="emphasis">routing</em>
<em class="emphasis">protocols</em> such as the Routing Information
Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) to build
<em class="emphasis">routing tables</em> in memory to determine how to get
the packets to their destinations. When routing a packet, a router
compares the packet's destination address to entries in the
routing table and sends the packet onward as directed by the routing
table. Often, there won't be a specific route for a particular
destination, and the router will use a <em class="emphasis">default</em>
<em class="emphasis">route;</em> generally, such a route directs the
packet towards smarter or better-connected routers. (The default
routes at most sites point towards the Internet.)</p><p>





In determining how to forward a packet towards its destination, a
normal router looks only at a normal packet's destination
address and asks only "<em class="emphasis">How</em> can I forward
this packet?" A packet filtering router also considers the
question "<em class="emphasis">Should</em> I forward this
packet?" The packet filtering router answers that question
according to the security policy programmed into the router via the
packet filtering rules.</p><p>





Some machines do packet filtering without doing routing; that is,
they may accept or reject packets destined for them before they do
further processing.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-2-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
Some unusual packets do contain routing information about how they
are to reach their destination, using the "source route"
IP option. These packets, called <em class="emphasis">source-routed
packets</em>, are discussed in <a href="ch04_02.html#ch04-4472">Section 4.2.2, "IP Options"</a>, in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>.</p><p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="ch08-4069" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">8.1. What Can You Do with Packet Filtering?</h2>





If you put enough work into it, you can do anything you want to with
packet filtering; all of the information that crosses the Internet
has to go into a packet at some point, after all. But some things are
very much easier to do than others. For instance, operations that
require detailed protocol knowledge or prolonged tracking of past
events are easier to do in proxy systems. Operations that are simple
but need to be done fast and on individual packets are easier to do
in packet filtering systems.</p><p>





The main advantage of packet filtering is leverage: it allows you to
provide, in a single place, particular protections for an entire
network. Consider the Telnet service as an example. If you disallow
Telnet by turning off the Telnet server on all your hosts, you still
have to worry about someone in your organization installing a new
machine (or reinstalling an old one) with the Telnet server turned
on. On the other hand, if Telnet is not allowed by your filtering
router, such a new machine would be protected right from the start,
regardless of whether or not its Telnet server was actually running.
This is an example of the kind of "fail safe" stance we
discussed in <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Security Strategies"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-503" /></a><a name="INDEX-504" /></a>Routers also
present a useful choke point (also discussed in <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Security Strategies"</a>) for all of the traffic entering or leaving a
network. Even if you have multiple routers for redundancy, you
probably have far fewer routers, under much tighter control, than you
have host machines.</p><p>





Certain protections can be provided <em class="emphasis">only</em> by
filtering routers, and then only if they are deployed in particular
locations in your network. For example, it's a good idea to
reject all external packets that have internal source addresses
 --  that is, packets that claim to be coming from internal
machines but that are actually coming in from the outside  -- 
because such packets are usually part of address-spoofing attacks. In
such attacks, an attacker is pretending to be coming from an internal
machine. You should also reject all internal packets that have
external source addresses; once again, they are usually part of
address-spoofing attacks. Decision-making of this kind can be done
only in a filtering router at the perimeter of your network. Only a
filtering router in that location (which is, by definition, the
boundary between "inside" and "outside") is
able to recognize such a packet, by looking at the source address and
whether the packet came from the inside (the internal network
connection) or the outside (the external network connection). <a href="ch08_01.html#ch08-67845">Figure 8-1</a> illustrates this type of source address
forgery.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-67845" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="302" alt="Figure 8-1" src="figs/fire2.0801.gif" width="475" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-1. Source address forgery</h4>

Filtering routers are also good at detecting and filtering out
illegal packets. Many denial of service attacks depend on sending
misformatted packets of one sort or another. Routers in general have
very reliable TCP/IP implementations (so they are not vulnerable to
these attacks) and are well placed to prevent these attacks.
General-purpose computers being used as packet filters are more
likely to be vulnerable to these attacks, but at least it is easier
to fix them than it is to fix all your internal machines.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.1.1. Basic Packet Filtering</h3>





<a name="INDEX-505" /></a>The
most straightforward kind of packet filtering lets you control (allow
or disallow) data transfer based on:</p><p>





<ul><li>The address the data is (supposedly) coming from</p><p></li><li>The address the data is going to<p></p></li><li><p>The session and application ports being used to transfer the data</p></li></ul>
Basic packet filtering systems don't do anything based on the
data itself; they don't make content-based decisions.
Straightforward packet filtering will let you say:</p><p>






Don't let anybody use the port used by Telnet (an application
protocol) to log in from the outside.</p><p>






or:</p><p>






Let everybody send us data over the port used for electronic mail by
SMTP (another application protocol).</p><p>






or even:</p><p>






That machine can send us data over the port used for news by NNTP
(yet another application protocol), but no other machines can do so.</p><p>






However, it won't let you say:</p><p>






This user can Telnet in from outside, but no other users can do so.</p><p>






because "user" isn't something a basic packet
filtering system can identify. And it won't let you say:</p><p>






You can transfer these files but not those files.</p><p>






because "file" also isn't something a basic packet
filtering system can identify. It won't even let you say:</p><p>






Only allow people to send us electronic mail over the port used by
SMTP.</p><p>






because a basic packet filtering system looks only at the port being
used; it can't tell whether the data is good data, conforming
to the protocol that's supposed to use that port, or whether
somebody is using the port for some other purpose.</p><p>





ore advanced packet filtering systems will let you look further into
the data of a packet. Instead of paying attention only to headers for
lower-level protocols, they also understand the data structures used
by higher-level protocols, so they can make more detailed decisions.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-4-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.1.2. Stateful or Dynamic Packet Filtering</h3>





Slightly more advanced packet filtering systems offer state tracking
and/or protocol checking (for well-known protocols). State tracking
allows you to make rules like the following:</p><p>






Let incoming UDP packets through only if they are responses to
outgoing UDP packets you have seen.</p><p>






or:</p><p>






Accept TCP packets with SYN set only as part of TCP connection
initiation.</p><p>






<a name="INDEX-506" /></a><a name="INDEX-507" /></a>This is
called <em class="emphasis">stateful</em> <em class="emphasis">packet</em>
<em class="emphasis">filtering</em> because the packet filter has to keep
track of the state of transactions. It is also called
<em class="emphasis">dynamic</em> <em class="emphasis">packet</em>
<em class="emphasis">filtering</em> because the behavior of the system
changes depending on the traffic it sees. For instance, if it's
using the preceding rule, you can't look at an incoming UDP
packet and say that it will always be accepted or rejected.</p><p>





Different systems keep track of different levels of state
information. Some people are willing to call something a stateful
packet filtering system if it enforces TCP state rules (which control
the flags used during startup and teardown of TCP sessions), even if
the packet filtering system provides no further stateful features.
While TCP state enforcement is nice to have (it helps to prevent some
forms of port scanning and denial of service), it does not allow you
to support additional protocols, and we do not consider it stateful
packet filtering.</p><p>





<a href="ch08_01.html#ch08-47122">Figure 8-2</a> illustrates dynamic packet filtering at
the UDP layer.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-47122" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="343" alt="Figure 8-2" src="figs/fire2.0802.gif" width="414" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-2. Dynamic packet filtering at the UDP layer</h4>

State tracking provides the ability to do things that you can't
do otherwise, but it also adds complications. First, the router has
to keep track of the state; this increases the load on the router,
opens it to a number of denial of service attacks, and means that if
the router reboots, packets may be denied when they should have been
accepted. If a packet may go through redundant routers, they all need
to have the same state information. There are protocols for
exchanging this information, but it's still a tricky business.
If you have redundant routers only for emergency failover, and most
traffic consistently uses the same router, it's not a problem.
If you are using redundant routers simultaneously, the state
information needs to be transferred between them almost continuously,
or the response packet may come through before the state is updated.</p><p>





Second, the router has to keep track of state without any guarantee
that there's ever going to be a response packet. Not all UDP
packets have responses. At some point, the router's going to
have to give up and get rid of the rule that will allow the response.
If the router gives up early, it will deny packets that should have
been accepted, causing delays and unneeded network traffic. If the
router keeps the rule too long, the load on the router will be
unneccessarily high, and there's an increased chance that
packets will be accepted when they should have been denied. Some
protocol specifications provide guidelines, but those are not
necessarily useful. For instance, DNS replies are supposed to arrive
within 5 seconds, but reply times for name service queries across the
Internet can be as high as 15 seconds; implementing to the protocol
specification will almost always deny a response that you wanted to
accept.</p><p>





This sort of filtering is also vulnerable to address forging; it is
validating that packets are responses based on their source
addresses, so an attacker who intercepts an outgoing packet can forge
the appropriate source address and return an acceptable
"reply" (or, depending on the implementation, a whole
bunch of packets all of which will be accepted as replies).
Nonetheless, this provides a reasonable degree of security for some
UDP-based protocols that would otherwise be extremely difficult to
protect.<a name="INDEX-508" /></a></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-5-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.1.3. Protocol Checking</h3>





<a name="INDEX-509" /></a>Protocol checking allows you to make
rules like:</p><p>






Let in packets bound for the DNS port, but only if they are formatted
like DNS packets.</p><p>






Protocol checking therefore helps you avoid situations where somebody
has set up an unsafe service on a port that is allowed through
because it normally belongs to a safe service. It can also help avoid
some attacks that involve sending misformatted packets to perfectly
genuine servers. Protocol checking is normally fairly rudimentary and
still can be circumvented by a determined insider. It also gives you
no guarantee that the data is good, so it will catch only a fairly
small number of attacks that involve sending hostile data to genuine
servers. However, it still provides a useful degree of sanity
checking.</p><p>





The most advanced packet filtering systems will allow you to specify
all sorts of data-specific rules for well-known protocols. For
instance, you can say:</p><p>






Disconnect any FTP connection where the remote username is
"anonymous".</p><p>






or:</p><p>






Do not allow HTTP transfers to these sites.</p><p>






In order to do this, these packet filters have to have a deep
understanding of the application protocol. In general, they can
provide this level of control only for a few popular protocols, and
there is a significant cost to provide it, since they have to process
larger amounts of data. Furthermore, it is often possible to
circumvent this sort of control. For instance, there are numerous
ways of getting to a site via HTTP without having the site's
name appear in the outgoing HTTP request, including using an IP
address instead of a hostname and using an anonymizing site set up to
provide this sort of service.</p><p>





Stateful packet filters may also look at protocol-specific details to
make state changes. Some protocols contain information about what
ports transactions will use. For instance, the file transfer protocol
FTP often uses a connection that is started from the server to the
client, and the two ends negotiate the port number that will be used
for this connection. A stateful packet filter that understands the
FTP protocol can watch this negotiation and allow the new connection
to be made, without allowing other connections of the same sort.
