<h2 class="sect1">10.11. Operating the Bastion Host </h2>





<a name="INDEX-848" />Once you
put the bastion host into production, your job has only just begun.
You'll need to keep a close watch on the operations of the
bastion host. <a href="ch26_01.html">Chapter 26, "Maintaining Firewalls"</a>, provides more information
on how to do this; this section discusses specific concerns for
bastion hosts.</p><p>





<a name="ch10-3894" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.11.1. Learn What the Normal Usage Profile Is</h3>





<a name="INDEX-849" /><a name="INDEX-850" />If
you're going to monitor the bastion host, looking for
abnormalities that might indicate break-ins or other types of system
compromise, you will need to first develop an understanding of what
the "normal" usage profile of the bastion host is. Ask
these questions and others like them:</p><p>





<ul><li>How many jobs tend to be running at any one time?</p><p></li><li>How much CPU time do these jobs consume relative to each other?</p></li><li><p>What is the typical load at different times throughout the day?</p></li></ul>
Your goal is to develop an almost intuitive grasp of what your system
normally runs like, so you'll be able to recognize  --  and
investigate  --  anomalous activity very quickly.</p><p>

<a name="ch10-3910" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.11.2. Consider Using Software to Automate Monitoring</h3>





<a name="INDEX-851" /><a name="INDEX-852" /><a name="INDEX-853" /><a name="INDEX-854" />Doing
a thorough job of system monitoring is tough. Although the logs
produced by your system provide lots of useful information,
it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of logging
data. The important information may often be buried. Too often, the
logs end up being used only <em class="emphasis">after</em> a break-in,
when, in fact, they could be used to detect  --  and thus perhaps
stop  --  a break-in while it is occurring.</p><p>





Because each operating system and site is different, each bastion
host is configured differently, and each site has different ideas
about what the response of a monitoring system should be. For
example, some want electronic mail; some want the output fed to an
existing SNMP-based management system, some want the systems to trip
the pagers of the system administrators, and so on. Monitoring tends
to be very site- and host-specific in the details.</p><p>





A large and growing number of monitoring packages is available for
Unix, including both freely available and commercial options. Among
the freely available options, NOCOL and NetSaint are both popular,
extensible systems that provide the ability to watch logs, to test to
make certain machines are still running and providing services, and
to alert people when things go wrong (see <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>, for information about how to get them).
<a name="INDEX-855" /> <a name="INDEX-856" /> <a name="INDEX-857" /></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-858" />MRTG is a
special sort of monitoring package, which provides graphing services
but not alerting services. It is extremely useful for watching
trends. Furthermore, MRTG makes very impressive web pages with very
little effort, so you not only find out what's going on, you
also get an important public relations tool for convincing people
that you know what's going on. Information about MRTG is also
available in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-859" />Normally, monitoring of Windows NT systems
is done with the Performance Monitor. Unfortunately, Performance
onitor is yet another tool based on SMB transactions, which cannot
be used without enabling all of SMB. Furthermore, Performance Monitor
is fairly limited as a monitoring solution for critical systems; it
doesn't provide all of the alarm and process-monitoring
features you may want.</p><p>





You will probably want to use an SNMP-based monitoring tool. Windows
NT provides an SNMP server, so all you will need to add is the
monitoring tool. Some public domain monitoring tools are now
available for Windows NT, although fewer than there are for Unix.
Some tools that were originally available only under Unix have now
been ported to Windows NT (for instance, MRTG). Unix-based monitoring
tools will monitor Windows NT systems without problems. In addition,
there are a large number of commercial SNMP-based tools you can
use.<a name="INDEX-860" /></p><p>
