<a name="INDEX-1358" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1359" /></a>The existence of the World Wide Web is a
major factor behind the explosive growth of the Internet. (In fact,
many of the newcomers to the Internet believe that the Internet and
the World Wide Web are the same thing.) Since the first graphical
user interface to the Web to gain widespread acceptance, NCSA Mosaic,
was introduced in 1993, web traffic on the Internet has been growing
at an explosive rate, far faster than any other kind of traffic (SMTP
email, FTP file transfers, Telnet remote terminal sessions, etc.).
You will certainly want to let your users use a browser to access web
sites, and you are very likely to want to run a site yourself, if you
do anything that might benefit from publicity. This chapter discusses
the underlying mechanisms involved, their security implications, and
the measures you can take to deal with them.<a name="INDEX-1360" /></a></p><p>





The very things that make the Web so popular also make it very
difficult to secure. The basic protocols are very flexible, and the
programs used for web servers and clients are easy to extend. Each
extension has its own security implications, but they are difficult
to separate and control.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1361" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1362" /></a>Most web browsers are capable of using
protocols other than HTTP, which is the basic protocol of the Web.
For example, these browsers are usually also Gopher and FTP clients
or are capable of using your existing Telnet and FTP clients
transparently (without it being obvious to the user that an external
program is starting). Many of them are also NNTP and SMTP clients.
They use a single, consistent notation called a Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) to specify connections of various types.</p><p>





In addition, a number of other protocols are used in conjunction with
web browsers. Some of these have other client programs, but most of
them are used primarily if not exclusively as a seamless part of web
sites.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1363" /></a>There are three basic sets of security
concerns regarding HTTP:</p><p>





<ul><li>What can a malicious client do to your HTTP server?</p><p></li><li>What can a malicious HTTP server do to your clients?<p></p></li><li><p>What else can come in, tunneled over HTTP?</p></li></ul>
The following sections describe these concerns.</p><p>



















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch15-68185" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">15.1. HTTP Server Security</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1364" /></a><a name="INDEX-1365" /></a>A server that supports
nothing but the bare HTTP protocol poses relatively few security
concerns. An HTTP server with no extensions takes requests and
returns files; the only thing it writes to the disk are log files.
Therefore, no matter how malicious the user and how badly written the
server, the vulnerabilities of an HTTP server by itself are pretty
much limited to various sorts of denial of service (the HTTP server
crashes, crashes the machine, makes the rest of the machine unusable,
fills up the disk . . .) and inadvertent release of data (a client
requests a file you wanted to keep private, but the server gives it
out). If the server is sufficiently badly written, an attacker may be
able to execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the HTTP
server via a buffer overflow attack. This is unlikely in a simple
server and relatively easy to protect against (run the server as an
account with no special privileges, and even if an attacker can
execute commands he or she won't get any interesting results).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1366" /></a>Denial of
service is always impossible to protect against completely, but a
well-written HTTP server will be relatively immune to it. Normal
practices for dealing with bastion hosts (see <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>) will also help you avoid and recover from
denial of service attacks. Publicly accessible web sites are
high-visibility targets and tend to be resource-intensive even when
they are not under attack, so it is probably unwise to combine them
on the same bastion host with other services.</p><p>





Inadvertent release of data is a problem that requires more special
effort to avoid. You should assume that any file that an HTTP server
can read is a file that it will give out. Don't assume that a
file is safe because it's not in the document tree, because
it's not in HTML, or because you haven't published a link
to it. It's easy to get caught out; one of the authors sent out
email to a bunch of friends about a web page, only to get an answer
back 20 minutes later that said "Interesting, but I don't
like the picture of me." "What picture of you?
You're not on that web page!" "No, but I always
look at the whole directory, and when I saw there was a
<em class="filename">.gif</em> file named after me I had to look at
it." That was a combination of a mistake on the author's
part (transferring an entire working directory into production
instead of just the parts intended to be published) and on the site
maintainer's part (it shouldn't have been giving out
directory information anyway).</p><p>





In this case, the effect was benign, but the same sort of mistake can
have much more serious consequences. Public web servers frequently
make headlines by containing draft or prerelease information
erroneously left with information intended to be published;
information intended for a small audience but left unprotected in the
hope that nobody will notice it; and information used internally by
the web server or other processes on the machine but left where the
web server can read it and outsiders can request it. That latter
category can include everything from Unix password files to customer
data (including credit card numbers!).</p><p>





In order to minimize these exposures:</p><p>





<ul><li>Carefully configure the security and access control features of your
server to restrict its capabilities and what users can access with
it.</p><p></li><li>Run the server as an unprivileged user.<p></p></li><li>Use filesystem permissions to be sure that the server cannot read
files it is not supposed to provide access to.</p><p></li><li>Under Unix, use the <em class="emphasis">chroot</em> mechanism to restrict
the server's operation to a particular section of your
filesystem hierarchy. You can use <em class="emphasis">chroot</em> either
within the server or through an external wrapper program.</p><p></li><li>Minimize the amount of sensitive information on the machine.<p></p></li><li>Limit the number of people who can put data on the externally visible
web sites; educate those people carefully about the implications of
publishing data.</p><p></li><li>Maintain a clear distinction between production and development
servers and specify a cleanup stage before data is moved to the
production servers.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="ch15-2-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.1.1. HTTP Extensions</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1367" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1368" /></a>In the
previous section, we discussed the risks of an HTTP server that
processes nothing but the base HTTP protocol and pointed out that
they're fairly small. This seems to conflict with the easily
observable fact that there are frequent and high-profile break-ins to
web sites. The problem is that almost nobody runs an HTTP server
without extensions. Almost all HTTP servers make extensive use of
external programs or additional protocols. (It used to be that
additional protocols were always implemented outside the web server,
but for efficiency reasons, it's become common to build
extension languages into the web server itself.)</p><p>





These extensions provide all sorts of capabilities; authoring
extensions allow people to add and change web pages using a browser,
form-processing extensions allow people to place orders for products,
database extensions check the current status of things, active page
extensions change the look of a page depending on who's asked
for it. Anything that a web server does besides returning an
unchanging data file requires some addition to the basic capabilities
of the server.</p><p>





These additions radically change the security picture. Instead of
providing an extremely limited interaction, they provide the ability
to do all sorts of dangerous things (like write data to the server).
Furthermore, many extensions are not simple, limited-function
modules; they're general-purpose languages, allowing you to
easily add your own insecurity at home. That means that the security
of your web server is no longer dependent only on the security of the
web server, which you can be relatively confident has been developed
by people who know something about security and have a development
and debugging process in place, but also on all the add-in programs,
which may well have been written in a few minutes by novice
programmers with no thoughts about security.</p><p>





Even if you don't install locally written programs, commercial
web server extensions have a long and dark history of security
problems. It's pretty easy to write a secure program if it
never has to write data. It's hard to write a secure program
that actually lets the user change things; it gets harder if the user
has to juggle high-value information (for instance, if you're
writing a electronic commerce application that is dealing with data
that has real-world effects on goods and money). It can become very
difficult to evaluate security if you're trying to provide
complete flexibility.</p><p>





The list of companies with serious security problems in their web
server extensions doesn't just read like a who's who of
the software industry; it's effectively the complete list of
companies that provide web servers or extensions! For instance,
icrosoft, Sun, Netscape, and Oracle have all had problems, often
repeatedly. Lest you think this a commercial problem, we should point
out that both the Apache server and the Squid cache server have had
their problems as well.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1369" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1370" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1371" /></a>You will often see external programs used
with web servers called <em class="emphasis">CGI scripts</em>, after the
Common Gateway Interface (CGI), which specifies how browsers can pass
information to servers. You will also often see
<em class="emphasis">Active</em> <em class="emphasis">Server</em>
<em class="emphasis">Pages</em> (ASP), which is a Microsoft technology for
making dynamic pages. New technologies for extensions appear at a
rapid rate, but they all have the same sorts of security
implications.</p><p>





There are two things you need to worry about with these extensions:</p><p>





<ul><li>Can an attacker trick extensions into doing something they
shouldn't?</p><p></li><li>Can an attacker run unexpected external programs?<p></p></li></ul>
<a name="ch15-11347" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.1.1.1. Tricking extensions</h3>





Your average HTTP server runs dozens of external programs; they often
come from multiple sources and are written in multiple languages.
It's not unusual for a single page to involve three or four
layers of programs. For instance, the web server calls an external
program written in Visual Basic, which uses Jet to access a database
server. In many cases, the people writing web pages are using
libraries and may not even be aware what other programs are getting
run. <a href="ch15_01.html#ch15-77688">Figure 15-1</a> shows one configuration where a
simple query to a web server involves multiple programs.</p><p>





<a name="ch15-77688" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="185" alt="Figure 15-1" src="figs/fire2.1501.gif" width="428" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 15-1. Layers of programs running on a web server</h4>

This situation is a security nightmare. Effectively, each of these
external programs is an Internet-attached server, with all the
security implications any other server has. If any one of them has
security problems, the entire system may be vulnerable; in the
previous example, you are vulnerable to problems in the web server,
the external program, the Visual Basic interpreter, Jet, and the
database server. Both the Visual Basic interpreter and Jet are
invisible in normal circumstances, but there have been security
problems with Jet.</p><p>





In the case of a program that accesses a database server, you may not
know exactly how it works, but at least you're probably aware
that the program is important to you. But security problems may exist
and be important even in programs that you think are too trivial to
worry about; for instance, there have been security problems with
counter programs (which are used to put up the little signs that say
"You are visitor number 437"). These programs appear to
be pretty harmless; after all, even if people can manipulate the
answer they return, who really cares? The difficulty is that they
keep the information in a file somewhere, which means that they are
capable of both reading and writing files on the machine. Some
counter programs can be manipulated into reading or writing any file
they have appropriate permissions for, and overwriting arbitrary
files with counter information can do a lot of damage.</p><p>





In order to minimize the risks created by external programs, treat
them as you would any other servers. In particular:</p><p>





<ul><li>Install external programs only after you have considered their
security implications and tested them on a protected machine.</p><p></li><li>Run as few external programs as possible.<p></p></li><li>Run external programs with minimal permissions.<p></p></li><li><p>Don't assume that programs will be accessed from pages or CGI
forms you provide.</p><p></li><li>Develop special bastion host configurations for external programs,
going through and removing all unneeded files and double-checking all
permissions and placements of files that are read and written.</p><p></li></ul>
The most common errors people make are:</p><p>





<ul><li>Taking a development tool or web server package and installing it on
a production machine without removing sample programs or other
development features. These are often proof-of-concept or debugging
tools that provide very broad access.</p><p></li><li>Running external programs with too many permissions, either by using
an overly powerful account (root, under Unix, for instance), or the
same account for a number of different external programs, or a
default account provided by a software vendor with normal user access
to the entire system (such accounts also often have a known name and
password).</p><p></li></ul>
ore conceptually, people are too trusting; they install combinations
of commercial, externally and internally produced programs or scripts
without considering their implications. Without suitable training,
very few programmers are capable of writing secure programs, and all
programs run by a web server need to be secure. No external vendor is
so large and clever that you can install their software directly onto
your production web server and feel sure that you are secure. No web
server add-on is so trivial that you can let a novice programmer
write it and not worry about its security.</p><p>





You must treat every single addition to your web server as a new
Internet-available server and evaluate its security appropriately.
You must also maintain them all, keeping track of any newly
discovered vulnerabilities and making appropriate modifications.
Allowing people who are not security-aware to put executable programs
on your web server is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>

<a name="ch15-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.1.1.2. Running unexpected external programs</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1372" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1373" /></a>The
second concern is that attackers might be able to run external
programs that you didn't intend to make available. In the worst
case, they upload their own external programs and cause your server
to run them. How could attackers do this? Suppose the following:</p><p>





<ul><li>Your HTTP server and your anonymous FTP server both run on the same
machine.</p><p></li><li>They can both access the same areas of the filesystem.<p></p></li><li>A writable directory is located somewhere in those areas, so that
customers can upload crash dumps from your product via FTP for
analysis by your programmers, for example.</p><p></li></ul>
In this case, the attacker might be able to upload a script or binary
to that writable directory using anonymous FTP and then cause the
HTTP server to run it.</p><p>





What is your defense against things like this? Once again, your best
bet is to restrict what filesystem areas each server can access (for
instance, using <em class="emphasis">chroot</em> under Unix) and to
provide a restricted environment in which each server can run. Note
that this sort of vulnerability is by no means limited to FTP but is
present any time that files can be uploaded.<a name="INDEX-1374" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1375" /></a><a name="INDEX-1376" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1377" /></a></p><p>
