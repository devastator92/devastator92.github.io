<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Real-Time Conferencing Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-183" /> <a name="INDEX-184" />A number of different
real-time conferencing services are available on the Internet,
including <em class="emphasis">talk</em>, IRC, web chat rooms, and the
various services provided over the Multicast Backbone (MBONE). All of
these services provide a way for people to interact with other
people, as opposed to interacting with databases or information
archives. Electronic mail and Usenet news are designed to facilitate
asynchronous communications; they work even if the participants
aren't currently logged in. The next time they log in, the
email messages or news postings will be waiting for them. Real-time
conferencing services, on the other hand, are designed for
interactive use by online participants.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-185" /><a name="INDEX-186" />Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
is sort of like Citizens Band (CB) radio on the Internet; it has its
own little culture involving lots of people talking at each other.
Users access IRC via dedicated IRC clients, or by using Telnet to
access a site that provides public IRC client service. IRC servers
provide hundreds (sometimes thousands) of named
"channels" for users to join. These channels come and go
(anyone can create a new channel, and a channel survives as long as
there's anyone on it), although some popular channels are more
or less permanent. Unlike <em class="emphasis">talk</em>, which is limited
to a pair of users, any number of people can participate on an IRC
channel simultaneously. Some IRC clients allow a user to participate
in multiple channels simultaneously (sort of like taking part in two
different conversations at once at a party).</p><p>





There are a number of security problems with IRC; most of the
problems aren't with the protocol itself, but with the clients,
and with who uses IRC and how. Many of the clients allow servers far
more access to local resources (files, processes, programs, etc.)
than is wise; a malicious server can wreak havoc with a weak client.
Further, many of the most frequent users of IRC are pranksters and
crackers who use IRC to pass technical information among themselves
and to try to trick other IRC users. Their idea of a fine time is to
tell some neophyte IRC user "Hey, give this command to your IRC
client so that I can show you this neat new toy I wrote". Then,
when the unsuspecting user follows the prankster's directions,
the commands trash the system. Anyone using IRC needs a good client
program and a healthy dose of wariness and suspicion.</p><p>





Purely web-based chat rooms have fewer vulnerabilities, but HTTP
doesn't lend itself well to chatting, so these tend to be
clunky and uncomfortable to use. People therefore have developed a
number of hybrid solutions using plug-ins to HTTP clients (for
instance, Mirabilis's ICQ and AOL's Messenger). These
provide much nicer interfaces but also introduce new vulnerabilities.
Like IRC, they have many "bad neighborhoods" where people
hang out looking for neophytes they can trick or attack. In addition,
the protocols and the plug-ins themselves are often vulnerable.</p><p>





ore complicated systems allow richer conversations. As high-speed
network connections become common, full-fledged video conferencing
systems have become popular, even across the Internet. The most
famous of those systems is Microsoft's NetMeeting. NetMeeting
and most other video conferencing systems in wide use are based on a
set of International Telecommunications Union standards and protocols
for video conferencing. These protocols are extremely difficult to
secure. They have almost every feature that makes a protocol
difficult to protect, including using multiple data streams,
initiating data transfer from both ends of the conversation (instead
of having a clearly defined client and server), using connectionless
protocols, and dynamically assigning port numbers instead of using
well-known port numbers. While they can be very useful, providing
them securely requires an extremely specialized firewall. Because
video conferencing involves large amounts of data, the firewall also
needs good performance.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-187" /><a name="INDEX-188" />The MBONE is the source
of a new set of services on the Internet, focusing on expanding
real-time conference services beyond text-based services like
<em class="emphasis">talk</em> and IRC to include audio, video, and
electronic whiteboard. The MBONE is used to send real-time video of
many technical conferences and programs over the Internet (e.g.,
Internet Engineering Task Force meetings, keynote sessions from
USENIX conferences, space shuttle flight operations, and so on). At
this point, the commonly used MBONE services appear to be reasonably
secure. Although there are theoretical problems, the only reported
attacks have been floods, which are easy to deal with. Theoretical
problems have a way of eventually becoming actual problems, but these
are extremely theoretical (nobody has verified that they are actually
exploitable at all) and not very threatening (if they were
exploitable, they still wouldn't be catastrophic).
Unintentional denial of service can be a real concern with the MBONE,
however, because audio and video can use so much bandwidth. The
methods used to distribute MBONE across the Internet also present
some interesting risks, which are discussed in <a href="ch19_01.html">Chapter 19, "Real-Time Conferencing Services"</a>.<a name="INDEX-189" /><a name="INDEX-190" /></p><p>
