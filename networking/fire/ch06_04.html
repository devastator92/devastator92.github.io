<h2 class="sect1">6.4. Architectures with Multiple Screened Subnets</h2>





Some networks will need more than one screened subnet. This happens
when there are multiple things that need to happen on a screened
subnet that have different security implications.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.1. Split-Screened Subnet</h3>





<a name="INDEX-426" /> <a name="INDEX-427" />In a <em class="emphasis">split-screened
subnet</em>, there is still a single interior router and an
exterior router, but multiple networks are between the two routers.
In general, the screened networks are connected to each other by one
or more dual-homed hosts, not by yet another router.</p><p>





Some sites use this architecture purely to provide defense in depth,
protecting a proxy host with the routers. The routers provide
protection from forgery, and protection from failures where the
dual-homed host starts to route traffic. The dual-homed host provides
finer controls on the connections than packet filtering. This is a
belt-and-suspenders firewall, providing excellent multilayered
protection, although it requires careful configuration on the
dual-homed host to be sure you're taking full advantage of the
possibilities. (There's no point in running simple,
straight-through proxies.) <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-52311">Figure 6-5</a> shows this
configuration.</p><p>

Others use this architecture to provide administrative access to
machines that also provide service to the Internet. This allows
administrators to use protocols that are too dangerous to allow to
the Internet on a sensitive machine (for instance, the NT-native
protocols used for remote User Manager and Performance Monitor use)
without relying solely on the exterior router as protection. It also
may be useful for performance reasons on machines making intense use
of the network; it prevents administrative traffic from using
bandwidth that could be used to serve user requests. <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-94837">Figure 6-6</a> shows this sort of architecture.</p><p>





In fact, machines that can drive multiple high-speed network
interfaces at full speed may benefit from having three network
interfaces; one to speak to the external users, one to speak to the
internal administrators, and one with no connections to other
networks that is used for backups and/or communications among bastion
hosts. <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-42001">Figure 6-8</a> shows this sort of architecture.</p><p>

<a name="ch06-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.2. Independent Screened Subnets</h3>





<a name="INDEX-430" /> <a name="INDEX-431" />In some cases you will want to have
multiple, <em class="emphasis">independent screened subnets,</em> with
separate exterior routers. <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-11884">Figure 6-7</a> shows this
configuration.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-11884" /><div class="figure"><img height="359" alt="Figure 6-7" src="figs/fire2.0607.gif" width="475" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-7. Architecture using multiple perimeter nets (multiple firewalls)</h4>

You might put in multiple perimeter nets to provide redundancy. It
doesn't make much sense to pay for two connections to the
Internet, and then run them both through the same router or routers.
Putting in two exterior routers, two perimeter nets, and two interior
routers ensures that no single point of failure is between you and
the Internet.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-15">[15]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-15" />[15]Providing, of course, that your two
Internet providers are actually running on different pieces of cable,
in different conduits. Never underestimate the destructive power of a
backhoe or a jackhammer.</p><p>




</blockquote>





You might also put in multiple perimeter nets for privacy, so that
you can run moderately confidential data across one, and an Internet
connection across the other. In that case, you might even attach both
perimeter nets to the same interior router.</p><p>





You might also want to use multiple perimeter nets to separate
inbound services (services that you provide to the Internet, like
publicly accessible web servers) from outbound services (services
that allow your users to get to the Internet, like a caching web
proxy). It is much easier to provide truly strong security to these
functions if you separate them, and if you use a split perimeter net
for the inbound services.</p><p>





Having multiple perimeter nets is less risky than having multiple
interior routers sharing the same internal net, but it's still
a maintenance headache. You will probably have multiple interior
routers, presenting multiple possible points of compromise. Those
routers must be watched very carefully to keep them enforcing
appropriate security policies; if they both connect to the Internet,
they need to enforce the same policy. <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-42001">Figure 6-8</a>
shows the sort of firewall an Internet service provider might use,
with many perimeter nets and multiple connections to the Internet.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">6.4.2.1. Appropriate uses</h3>





Independent screened subnets are appropriate in networks with a
particularly strong need for redundancy, or with high security
requirements and several independent uses of the Internet.<a name="INDEX-432" /> <a name="INDEX-433" /></p><p>
