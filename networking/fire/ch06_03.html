<h2 class="sect1">6.3. Screened Subnet Architectures</h2>





<a name="INDEX-407" /><a name="INDEX-408" />The <em class="emphasis">screened subnet
architecture</em> adds an extra layer of security to the
screened host architecture by adding a perimeter network that further
isolates the internal network from the Internet.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-409" /><a name="INDEX-410" />Why do this? By their nature, bastion hosts
are the most vulnerable machines on your network. Despite your best
efforts to protect them, they are the machines most likely to be
attacked because they're the machines that <em class="emphasis">can
be</em> attacked. If, as in a screened host architecture, your
internal network is wide open to attack from your bastion host, then
your bastion host is a very tempting target. No other defenses are
between it and your other internal machines (besides whatever host
security they may have, which is usually very little). If someone
successfully breaks into the bastion host in a screened host
architecture, that intruder has hit the jackpot. By isolating the
bastion host on a perimeter network, you can reduce the impact of a
break-in on the bastion host. It is no longer an instantaneous
jackpot; it gives an intruder some access but not all.</p><p>





With the simplest type of screened subnet architecture, there are two
screening routers, each connected to the perimeter net. One sits
between the perimeter net and the internal network, and the other
sits between the perimeter net and the external network (usually the
Internet). To break into the internal network with this type of
architecture, an attacker would have to get past <em class="emphasis">both
</em>routers. Even if the attacker somehow broke in to the
bastion host, he'd still have to get past the interior router.
There is no single vulnerable point that will compromise the internal
network.</p><p>





<a href="ch06_03.html#ch06-1929">Figure 6-4</a> shows a possible firewall configuration
that uses the screened subnet architecture. The next few sections
describe the components in this type of architecture.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">6.3.1. Perimeter Network</h3>





<a name="INDEX-411" /><a name="INDEX-412" />The
perimeter network is another layer of security, an additional network
between the external network and your protected internal network. If
an attacker successfully breaks into the outer reaches of your
firewall, the perimeter net offers an additional layer of protection
between that attacker and your internal systems.</p><p>





Here's an example of why a perimeter network can be helpful. In
many network setups, it's possible for any machine on a given
network to see the traffic for every machine on that network. This is
true for most Ethernet-based networks (and Ethernet is by far the
most common local area networking technology in use today); it is
also true for several other popular technologies, such as token ring
and FDDI. Snoopers may succeed in picking up passwords by watching
for those used during Telnet, FTP, and <em class="emphasis">rlogin</em>
sessions. Even if passwords aren't compromised, snoopers can
still peek at the contents of sensitive files people may be
accessing, interesting email they may be reading, and so on; the
snooper can essentially "watch over the shoulder" of
anyone using the network. A large number of tools are available that
attackers use to do this sort of snooping and to conceal that
it's being done.</p><p>





With a perimeter network, if someone breaks into a bastion host on
the perimeter net, they'll be able to snoop only on traffic on
that net. All the traffic on the perimeter net should be either to or
from the bastion host, or to or from the Internet. Because no
strictly internal traffic (that is, traffic between two internal
hosts, which is presumably sensitive or proprietary) passes over the
perimeter net, internal traffic will be safe from prying eyes if the
bastion host is compromised.</p><p>





Obviously, traffic to and from the bastion host, or the external
world, will still be visible. Part of the work in designing a
firewall is ensuring that this traffic is not itself confidential
enough that reading it will compromise your site as a whole.</p><p>

<a name="ch06-1947" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.2. Bastion Host</h3>





<a name="INDEX-413" />With the
screened subnet architecture, you attach a bastion host (or hosts) to
the perimeter net; this host is the main point of contact for
incoming connections from the outside world; for example:</p><p>





<ul><li>For incoming email (SMTP) sessions to deliver electronic mail to the
site</p><p></li><li>For incoming FTP connections to the site's anonymous FTP server</p></li><li>For incoming Domain Name System (DNS) queries about the site</p></li></ul>
and so on.</p><p>





Outbound services (from internal clients to servers on the Internet)
are handled in either of these ways:</p><p>





<ul><li>Set up packet filtering on both the exterior and interior routers to
allow internal clients to access external servers directly.</p><p></li><li>Set up proxy servers to run on the bastion host (if your firewall
uses proxy software) to allow internal clients to access external
servers indirectly. You would also set up packet filtering to allow
the internal clients to talk to the proxy servers on the bastion host
and vice versa, but to prohibit direct communications between
internal clients and the outside world.</p><p></li></ul>
In either case, packet filtering allows the bastion host to connect
to, and accept connections from, hosts on the Internet; which hosts,
and for what services, are dictated by the site's security
policy.</p><p>





uch of what the bastion host does is act as proxy server for various
services, either by running specialized proxy server software for
particular protocols (such as HTTP or FTP), or by running standard
servers for self-proxying protocols (such as SMTP).</p><p>





<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, describes how to secure a bastion host,
and the chapters in <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a>, describe how to
configure individual services to work with the firewall.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-1978" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.3. Interior Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-414" /><a name="INDEX-415" /><a name="INDEX-416" />The <em class="emphasis">interior router
</em>(sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">choke router</em> in
firewalls literature) protects the internal network both from the
Internet <em class="emphasis">and</em> from the perimeter net.</p><p>





The interior router does most of the packet filtering for your
firewall. It allows selected services outbound from the internal net
to the Internet. These services are the services your site can safely
support and safely provide using packet filtering rather than
proxies. (Your site needs to establish its own definition of what
"safe" means. You'll have to consider your own
needs, capabilities, and constraints; there is no one answer for all
sites.) The services you allow might include outgoing HTTP, Telnet,
FTP, and others, as appropriate for your own needs and concerns. (For
detailed information on how you can use packet filtering to control
these services, see <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>.)</p><p>





The services the interior router allows between your bastion host (on
the perimeter net itself) and your internal net are not necessarily
the same services the interior router allows between the Internet and
your internal net. The reason for limiting the services between the
bastion host and the internal network is to reduce the number of
machines (and the number of services on those machines) that can be
attacked from the bastion host, should it be compromised.</p><p>





You should limit the services allowed between the bastion host and
the internal net to just those that are actually needed, such as SMTP
(so the bastion host can forward incoming email), DNS (so the bastion
host can answer questions from internal machines, or ask them,
depending on your configuration), and so on. You should further limit
services, to the extent possible, by allowing them only to or from
particular internal hosts; for example, SMTP might be limited only to
connections between the bastion host and your internal mail server or
servers. Pay careful attention to the security of those remaining
internal hosts and services that can be contacted by the bastion
host, because those hosts and services will be what an attacker goes
after  --  indeed, will be all the attacker
<em class="emphasis">can</em> go after  --  if the attacker manages to
break in to your bastion host.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2002" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.4. Exterior Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-417" /><a name="INDEX-418" /><a name="INDEX-419" /><a name="INDEX-420" />In theory, the
<em class="emphasis">exterior router</em> (sometimes called the
<em class="emphasis">access router</em> in firewalls literature) protects
both the perimeter net and the internal net from the Internet. In
practice, exterior routers tend to allow almost anything outbound
from the perimeter net, and they generally do very little packet
filtering. The packet filtering rules to protect internal machines
would need to be essentially the same on both the interior router and
the exterior router; if there's an error in the rules that
allows access to an attacker, the error will probably be present on
both routers.</p><p>





Frequently, the exterior router is provided by an external group (for
example, your Internet provider), and your access to it may be
limited. An external group that's maintaining a router will
probably be willing to put in a few general packet filtering rules
but won't want to maintain a complicated or frequently changing
rule set. You also may not trust them as much as you trust your own
routers. If the router breaks and they install a new one, are they
going to remember to reinstall the filters? Are they even going to
bother to mention that they replaced the router so that you know to
check?</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-421" />The
only packet filtering rules that are really special on the exterior
router are those that protect the machines on the perimeter net (that
is, the bastion hosts and the internal router). Generally, however,
not much protection is necessary, because the hosts on the perimeter
net are protected primarily through host security (although
redundancy never hurts).</p><p>





The rest of the rules that you could put on the exterior router are
duplicates of the rules on the interior router. These are the rules
that prevent insecure traffic from going between internal hosts and
the Internet. To support proxy services, where the interior router
will let the internal hosts send some protocols as long as they are
talking <em class="emphasis">to</em> the bastion host, the exterior router
could let those protocols through as long as they are coming
<em class="emphasis">from</em> the bastion host. These rules are desirable
for an extra level of security, but they're theoretically
blocking only packets that can't exist because they've
already been blocked by the interior router. If they do exist, either
the interior router has failed, or somebody has connected an
unexpected host to the perimeter network.</p><p>





So, what does the exterior router actually need to do? One of the
security tasks that the exterior router <em class="emphasis">can</em>
usefully perform  --  a task that usually can't easily be
done anywhere else  --  is the blocking of any incoming packets
from the Internet that have forged source addresses. Such packets
claim to have come from within the internal network but actually are
coming in from the Internet.</p><p>





The interior router could do this, but it can't tell if packets
that claim to be from the perimeter net are forged. While the
perimeter net shouldn't have anything fully trusted on it,
it's still going to be more trusted than the external universe;
being able to forge packets from it will give an attacker most of the
benefits of compromising the bastion host. The exterior router is at
a clearer boundary. The interior router also can't protect the
systems on the perimeter net against forged packets. (We discuss
forged packets in greater detail in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>.)<a name="INDEX-422" /><a name="INDEX-423" /><a name="INDEX-424" /><a name="INDEX-425" /></p><p>





Another task that the exterior router can perform is to prevent IP
packets containing inappropriate source addresses from leaving your
network. All traffic leaving your network should come from one of
your source addresses. If not, then either you have a serious
configuration problem, or somebody is forging source addresses.</p><p>





Although filtering inappropriate source addresses outbound
doesn't provide any network protection to you, it prevents an
intruder from using your systems to launch certain types of attacks
on other sites. If the exterior router is configured to alert you
when forged source addresses are seen, this may be just the early
warning alarm you need in order to detect a serious network problem.
The practice of being a good network citizen may also be enough to
keep the name of your site out of a possibly embarrassing news
headline.</p><p>
