<h2 class="sect1">16.9. Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1612" /> <a name="INDEX-1613" /> <a name="INDEX-1614" />NNTP
is the service generally used to transfer Usenet news across the
Internet. A news server is the place where Usenet news flows into and
out of your organization, and which your users access (via news
clients) to read and post news. News servers generally speak NNTP
among themselves so they can transfer news between sites. In
addition, most news clients use NNTP to access news servers.
(Traditionally, Unix-based news clients read news from local files,
and some sites may still be using older clients that do this.)</p><p>





There are a number of freely available news servers, including
B-News, C-News, and INN. There are also number of commercial servers,
which claim to have better performance.</p><p>





These days, not all sites choose to offer news. If you do not have
your own news server, you may wish to allow your users to contact
external NNTP servers. The risk involved is relatively low; although
NNTP has been used to attack news servers, there are no known serious
problems with the NNTP protocol for clients. NNTP does, of course,
provide another way for information to flow into and out of your
organization, where the inbound information may include undesirable
things like viruses, illegitimate copies of copyrighted information,
and data that is illegal to distribute in some jurisdictions
(including hate speech and pornography), and the outbound information
may include your organization's secrets. These are the same
risks found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP, and an NNTP client is
vulnerable to the same data-driven risks as an electronic mail
client, including the risks associated with handling of MIME- and
HTML-enhanced
messages.<a name="INDEX-1615" /></p><p>





If you do choose to run your own news server, the best way to
configure it is the same way that you configure SMTP; set up a server
on a bastion host that talks to external sites, possibly sanitizing
information in the process, and relays news to an internal server.
Your internal clients then exchange news with the internal server.
The external server needs only a minimal configuration, since the
news will be stored on the internal server. This configuration gives
you a maximum of security and control, but it is a significant amount
of administrative overhead. In addition, even minimal news servers
place a heavy load on machines, and it is advisable to put the
externally visible news server on a dedicated bastion host.</p><p>





If you are unable to use a configuration with two news servers, the
next best option is to use a single news server on a bastion host. If
you do this, you will be able to support only news readers that use
NNTP; older Unix clients that expect to read files directly will not
have access to the bastion host. In addition, you should not create
private newsgroups that are intended to be internal to your
organization if your news server is a bastion host. The probability
that the newsgroups will leak to the outside universe is far too
high.</p><p>





Finally, you can use a single news server on your internal network
and very carefully control which hosts can reach it. This is the most
dangerous option, since you are letting external hosts make
connections directly to your internal network. However, you can limit
the connections to those servers you exchange news with, and this
solution will let you have internal newsgroups and non-NNTP news
readers. In this situation, you should try to use servers and feed
sites that support NNTP authentication, so that you have some
authentication besides the IP source address. NNTP authentication is
not standard but is implemented in many servers.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.9.1. Packet Filtering Characteristics of NNTP</h3>





NNTP is a TCP-based service. NNTP servers use port 119. NNTP clients
(including servers transferring news to other servers) use ports
above 1023. Some news servers (in particular, INN) allow you to
specify other port numbers to use for server-server transactions,
which can be useful for a number of reasons. In particular, it allows
you to separate server-server transactions from server-reader
transactions and put separate restrictions on them. This can be
particularly useful on heavily loaded servers that may otherwise have
difficulty receiving news during peak reading times.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.9.2. Proxying Characteristics of NNTP</h3>





NNTP is a store-and-forward protocol, capable of doing its own
proxying. It is also easy to proxy as a straightforward
single-connection protocol. TIS FWTK provides a generic proxy,
<em class="emphasis">plug-gw</em>, which is frequently used with NNTP, as
well as modified user procedures (the NNTP connection is directed to
the proxy server, which redirects the connection based on the client
address). It would be easy to modify clients to use a generic
modified-client proxy like SOCKS. In addition, the clients provided
with web browsers (including Netscape Navigator and Internet
Explorer) are capable of using SOCKS.</p><p>

<a name="ch16-33-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.9.3. Network Address Translation Characteristics of NNTP</h3>





NNTP does not use embedded IP addresses and will work with network
address translation systems. However, NNTP servers may use the source
IP address and port of connections as an authentication mechanism. In
addition, news articles will contain hostname information, which may
be either a name provided by the client that submits the article, or
a name gotten by resolving the source IP address, or both. This may
give away information that you don't want to make public. In
addition, running NNTP through network address translation may cause
the NNTP server to decide that you're lying about your host
information (because the name provided by the client and the name
gotten by resolving the source IP address don't match).</p><p>
