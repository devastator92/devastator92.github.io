<h2 class="sect1">5.3. Proxy Services</h2>





In general, a <em class="emphasis">proxy</em> is something or someone who
does something on somebody else's behalf. For instance, you may
give somebody the ability to vote for you by proxy in an election.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-364" /><a name="INDEX-365" /><a name="INDEX-366" />Proxy
services are specialized application or server programs that take
users' requests for Internet services (such as FTP and Telnet)
and forward them to the actual services. The proxies provide
replacement connections and act as gateways to the services. For this
reason, proxies are sometimes known as <em class="emphasis">application-level
gateways</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a> In this book, when we are talking about proxy services,
we are specifically talking about proxies run for security purposes,
which are run on a firewall host: either a dual-homed host with an
interface on the internal network and one on the external network, or
some other bastion host that has access to the Internet and is
accessible from the internal machines.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-14" />[14]Firewall terminologies differ.
Whereas we use the term <em class="emphasis">proxy service</em> to
encompass the entire proxy approach, other authors refer to
<em class="emphasis">application-level gateways</em> and
<em class="emphasis">circuit-level gateways</em>. Although there are small
differences between the meanings of these various terms, which
we'll explore in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>, in general our
discussion of proxies refers to the same type of technology other
authors mean when they refer to these gateway systems.</p><p>




</blockquote>





You will also run into proxies that are primarily designed for
network efficiency instead of for security; these are
<em class="emphasis">caching proxies,</em> which keep copies of the
information for each request that they proxy. The advantage of a
caching proxy is that if multiple internal hosts request the same
data, the data can be provided directly by the proxy. Caching proxies
can significantly reduce the load on network connections. There are
proxy servers that provide both security and caching; in general,
they are better at one purpose than the other.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-367" />Proxy services
sit, more or less transparently, between a user on the inside (on the
internal network) and a service on the outside (on the Internet).
Instead of talking to each other directly, each talks to a proxy.
Proxies handle all the communication between users and Internet
services behind the scenes.</p><p>





Transparency is the major benefit of proxy services. It's
essentially smoke and mirrors. To the user, a proxy server presents
the illusion that the user is dealing directly with the real server.
To the real server, the proxy server presents the illusion that the
real server is dealing directly with a user on the proxy host (as
opposed to the user's real host).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-368" />How do proxy
services work? Let's look at the simplest case, where we add
proxy services to a dual-homed host. (We'll describe these
hosts in some detail in <a href="ch06_01.html#ch06-1849">Section 6.1.2, "Dual-Homed Host "</a>
in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Firewall Architectures"</a>.)</p><p>





<a name="ch05-5-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
Proxy services are effective only when they're used in
conjunction with a mechanism that restricts direct communications
between the internal and external hosts. Dual-homed hosts and packet
filtering are two such mechanisms. If internal hosts are able to
communicate directly with external hosts, there's no need for
users to use proxy services, and so (in general) they won't.
Such a bypass probably isn't in accordance with your security
policy.</p><p>




</blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-369" /><a name="INDEX-370" />As <a href="ch05_03.html#ch05-1809">Figure 5-2</a> shows, a proxy service requires two components:
a proxy server and a proxy client. In this illustration, the
<em class="emphasis">proxy server</em> runs on the dual-homed host (as we
discuss in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>, there are other ways to set
up a proxy server). A <em class="emphasis">proxy client</em> is a special
version of a normal client program (e.g., a Telnet or FTP client)
that talks to the proxy server rather than to the "real"
server out on the Internet; in some configurations, normal client
programs can be used as proxy clients. The proxy server evaluates
requests from the proxy client and decides which to approve and which
to deny. If a request is approved, the proxy server contacts the real
server on behalf of the client (thus the term
<em class="emphasis">proxy</em>) and proceeds to relay requests from the
proxy client to the real server, and responses from the real server
to the proxy client.</p><p>





<a name="ch05-1809" /><div class="figure"><img height="289" alt="Figure 5-2" src="figs/fire2.0502.gif" width="467" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-2. Using proxy services with a dual-homed host</h4>

In some proxy systems, instead of installing custom client proxy
software, you'll use standard software but set up custom user
procedures for using it. (We'll describe how this works in
<a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>.)</p><p>





There are also systems that provide a hybrid between packet filtering
and proxying where a network device intercepts the connection and
acts as a proxy or redirects the connection to a proxy; this allows
proxying without making changes to the clients or the user
procedures.</p><p>





The proxy server doesn't always just forward users'
requests on to the real Internet services. The proxy server can
control what users do because it can make decisions about the
requests it processes. Depending on your site's security
policy, requests might be allowed or refused. For example, the FTP
proxy might refuse to let users export files, or it might allow users
to import files only from certain sites. More sophisticated proxy
services might allow different capabilities to different hosts,
rather than enforcing the same restrictions on all hosts.</p><p>





Some proxy servers do in fact just forward requests on, no matter
what they are. These may be called <em class="emphasis">generic
proxies</em> or <em class="emphasis">port forwarders.</em> Programs
that do this are providing basically the same protections that you
would get if you had a packet filter in place that was allowing
traffic on that port. You do not get any significant increase in
security by replacing packet filters with proxies that do exactly the
same thing (you gain some protection against malformed packets, but
you lose by adding an attackable proxying program).</p><p>





Some excellent software is available for proxying. SOCKS is a proxy
construction toolkit, designed to make it easy to convert existing
client/server applications into proxy versions of those same
applications. The Trusted Information Systems Internet Firewall
Toolkit (TIS FWTK) includes proxy servers for a number of common
Internet protocols, including Telnet, FTP, HTTP,
<em class="emphasis">rlogin</em>, X11, and others; these proxy servers are
designed to be used in conjunction with custom user procedures. See
the discussion of these packages in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>.</p><p>





any standard client and server programs, both commercial and freely
available, now come equipped with their own proxying capabilities or
with support for generic proxy systems like SOCKS. These capabilities
can be enabled at runtime or compile time.</p><p>





ost proxy systems are used to control and optimize outbound
connections; they are controlled by the site where the clients are.
It is also possible to use proxy systems to control and optimize
inbound connections to servers (for instance, to balance connections
among multiple servers or to apply extra security). This is sometimes
called <em class="emphasis">reverse proxying.</em><a name="INDEX-371" /></p><p>





<a name="ch05-7120" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.1. Advantages of Proxying</h3>





<a name="INDEX-372" />There
are a number of advantages to using proxy services.</p><p>





<a name="ch05-7130" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.1.1. Proxy services can be good at logging</h3>





<a name="INDEX-373" />Because proxy servers
can understand the application protocol, they can allow logging to be
performed in a particularly effective way. For example, instead of
logging all of the data transferred, an FTP proxy server can log only
the commands issued and the server responses received; this results
in a much smaller and more useful log.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch05-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.1.2. Proxy services can provide caching</h3>





Since all requests are passing through the proxy service anyway, the
proxy can provide caching, keeping local copies of the requested
data. If the number of repeat requests is significant, caching can
significantly increase performance and reduce the load on network
links.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch05-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.1.3. Proxy services can do intelligent filtering</h3>





Since a proxy service is looking at specific connections, it is
frequently able to do filtering more intelligently than a packet
filter. For instance, proxy services are much more capable of
filtering HTTP by content type (for instance, to remove Java or
JavaScript) and better at virus detection than packet filtering
systems.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch05-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.1.4. Proxy systems can perform user-level authentication</h3>





Because a proxy system is actively involved in the connection, it is
easy for it to do user authentication and to take actions that depend
on the user involved. Although this is possible with packet filtering
systems, it is much more difficult.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch05-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.1.5. Proxy systems automatically provide protection for weak or faulty IP implementations</h3>





As a proxy system sits between a client and the Internet, it
generates completely new IP packets for the client. It can therefore
protect clients from deliberately malformed IP packets. (You just
need a proxy system that isn't vulnerable to the bad packets!)</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch05-7137" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.2. Disadvantages of Proxying</h3>





There are also some disadvantages to using proxy services.</p><p>





<a name="ch05-7140" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.2.1. Proxy services lag behind nonproxied services</h3>





<a name="INDEX-374" /><a name="INDEX-375" /><a name="INDEX-376" /><a name="INDEX-377" />Although proxy software is widely available
for the older and simpler services like FTP and Telnet, proven
software for newer or less widely used services is harder to find.
There's usually a distinct lag between the introduction of a
service and the availability of proxying servers for it; the length
of the lag depends primarily on how well the service is designed for
proxying. This makes it difficult for a site to offer new services
immediately as they become available. Until suitable proxy software
is available, a system that needs new services may have to be placed
outside the firewall, opening up potential security holes. (Some
services can be run through generic proxies, which will give at least
minimal protection.)</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch05-7157" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.2.2. Proxy services may require different servers for each service</h3>





You may need a different proxy server for each protocol, because the
proxy server may need to understand the protocol in order to
determine what to allow and disallow, and in order to masquerade as a
client to the real server and as the real server to the proxy client.
Collecting, installing, and configuring all these various servers can
be a lot of work. Again, you may be able to use a generic proxy, but
generic proxies provide only the same sorts of protection and
functionality that you could get from packet filters.</p><p>





Products and packages differ greatly in the ease with which they can
be configured, but making things easier in one place can make it
harder in others. For example, servers that are particularly easy to
configure can be limited in flexibility; they're easy to
configure because they make certain assumptions about how
they're going to be used, which may or may not be correct or
appropriate for your site.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch05-7161" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.3.2.3. Proxy services usually require modifications to clients, applications, or procedures</h3>





Except for services designed for proxying, you will need to use
modified clients, applications, and/or procedures. These
modifications can have drawbacks; people can't always use the
readily available tools with their normal instructions.</p><p>





Because of these modifications, proxied applications don't
always work as well as nonproxied applications. They tend to bend
protocol specifications, and some clients and servers are less
flexible than others.<a name="INDEX-378" /></p><p>
