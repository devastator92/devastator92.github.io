<h2 class="sect1">20.4. The Windows Browser</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1900" /> <a name="INDEX-1901" /> <a name="INDEX-1902" />The information that Windows machines
display in the Network Neighborhood and in other places where you can
pick a computer from a list comes from a server known as the Windows
Browser. This is a separate service from name resolution and is not
just dependent on name resolution, but also intertwined with it. In
particular, machines use special names to locate Browser servers, and
those names are sometimes registered and resolved exceptionally. The
Browser service is responsible for most of the mysterious broadcast
packets to port 138 that you will see on Windows networks, and a
significant number of the mysterious headaches suffered by Windows
administrators. The headaches are greatly magnified by the fact that
very few people understand exactly what Browser service is supposed
to do, let alone how it does it.</p><p>





The Browser service is responsible only for maintaining lists of
computers so that human beings can pick them from the list instead of
having to be able to type the computer's name. The Browser does
not list the resources actually available on the computer; it
isn't part of WINS, much less the same thing as WINS; and it
isn't involved in any direct interactions between servers and
clients. It's not at all unusual for a machine to be visible
via the Browser but not actually accessible, and this is not a
problem with the Browser. If it is accessible but unintentionally
invisible, that's a Browser problem but not a surprise.</p><p>





Originally, Windows Browser service was entirely broadcast-based. A
number of complicated changes have been made to allow it to work
across routers, so that in theory if a network stays the same for
long enough, and contains enough Windows NT machines, browsing
information will stabilize and propagate across the entire network.
For a complex network, this process may take a considerable amount of
time and in fact will often take longer than the average delay
between network changes.</p><p>





<a name="ch20-32-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.1. Domains and Workgroups</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1903" /> <a name="INDEX-1904" />
<a name="INDEX-1905" /> <a name="INDEX-1906" />Every
machine on a Windows network must be part of some domain or
workgroup. A <em class="emphasis">workgroup</em> is simply a collection of
machines that share the same workgroup registration; there are no
controls over what machines can be in a workgroup. Being a member of
a workgroup is like being a sports fan; if you say you're part
of the group, then you are.</p><p>





A <em class="emphasis">domain</em> is an administrative entity where there
is a centralized source of information (a domain controller). Joining
a domain is like joining an exclusive club; you have to be admitted
by the administration. Unfortunately, it is possible to create a
workgroup with the same name as a domain.</p><p>





The Browser service was created before domains, and as a result, it
is not fully aware of the distinction between workgroups and domains.
It treats them identically and pretends that they are domains (both
by calling them domains and by assuming that every group of
workstations that it knows about has a contactable domain
controller).</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-33-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.2. Windows Browser Roles</h3>





A Browser server contains information about a single domain, which it
gathers by listening to the registrations broadcast by machines at
boot time. Since the Browser is primarily broadcast-based, many
things about the Browser apply to the set of machines that are
reachable by broadcast. For convenience, we'll call this set of
machines a <em class="emphasis">subnet</em>, although depending on how you
configure your network it may not technically be a subnet.</p><p>





ost machines that know about Browser service are capable of being
Browser servers, and it is perfectly legitimate for multiple machines
on the same subnet to be Browser servers for the same domain or
workgroup. These machines will use broadcast to elect a master
browser. There will always be exactly one master browser per subnet
per domain or workgroup. A single subnet may have multiple master
browsers for different domains or workgroups, and a single domain or
workgroup may have multiple master browsers on different subnets.
<a href="ch20_04.html#ch20-34836">Figure 20-7</a> shows a network with multiple subnets
and multiple domains and the resulting browser configuration.</p><p>





<a name="ch20-34836" /><div class="figure"><img height="217" alt="Figure 20-7" src="figs/fire2.2007.gif" width="471" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 20-7. Master browsers in a network with multiple domains and multiple subnets</h4>

In general, users don't care about subnet boundaries; they want
to know about all the machines in a domain or workgroup, regardless
of what subnet they're on. Since Browser servers collect data
via broadcast, it requires some mechanism for master browsers on
different networks to synchronize information. In a workgroup
configuration, there is simply no way for this to occur. Workgroups
have no centralized structure. In a domain configuration, however,
there is a central source of information (the domain controller), and
the master browsers for a domain will all synchronize to it. The
domain controller's centralized Browser server is called a
<em class="emphasis">domain master browser</em>.</p><p>





Browser servers do not initiate transactions to individual hosts by
their normal names. Instead, the Browser sends out broadcast packets
or unicast packets to special hostnames. The Browser does not need to
know how to find other servers; it simply tries to send packets to
the name that the server would be using if it existed. If no server
is there, name resolution will fail (for unicast packets), or the
broadcast will be ignored (for broadcast packets). The Browser
simplifies things still further by not even attempting name
resolution for most group names and simply sending out broadcasts
with a destination NetBIOS name set. Hosts that are not part of the
group will ignore the broadcasts.</p><p>





The following sections describe the browser roles and the names
associated with them.</p><p>





<a name="ch20-34-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.4.2.1. Domain master browser</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1907" /><a name="INDEX-1908" />The domain master
browser registers a unique name with the name of the domain and the
type 1B. It is always the primary domain controller. Because it is a
domain controller, it also registers a group name with the name of
the domain and the type 1C. Aside from registering the name, the
domain master browser takes no special actions. Other master browsers
will initiate connections to it for synchronization. (This will be
true whether or not there is an actual domain master browser, since
the Browser assumes that everything is a domain. If there is no
domain master browser, or it is unreachable, the amount of name
resolution traffic will be significant as master browsers try to
resolve the 1B and 1C names.)</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-35-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.4.2.2. Master browser</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1909" />A master browser registers a unique
name with the name of the domain and the type 1D. This represents a
problem for WINS because WINS spans multiple subnets. It's
legal for more than one master browser to exist, as long as
they're on different subnets, but if they're all talking
to the same WINS server, they shouldn't be able to register the
name as a unique name. This is dealt with by having WINS treat the
type 1D as special. WINS servers will return success for any attempt
to register a unique name with type 1D, and failure for any attempt
to resolve such a name. This allows the broadcast-based NetBT name
service to handle uniqueness and resolution for master browsers.</p><p>





A master browser also registers the group name _MSBROWSE_, which is
used to distribute information among master browsers so that each one
has the full list of available domains and workgroups.</p><p>





aster browsers collect information from broadcasts to build up a
list of all hosts in the domain or workgroup that they are
responsible for, and to build up a list of other domains and
workgroups and their master browsers.</p><p>





aster browsers initiate four types of communication:</p><p>





<ul><li>They broadcast their lists of hosts and domains to the backup
browsers (using the group with the name of the domain and the type
1E).</p><p></li><li>They broadcast their domain and name to the other master browsers
(using the group _MSBROWSE_).</p><p></li><li>They synchronize their lists of hosts and domains with their domain
master browser (using the unique name with the name of the domain and
the type 1B or, if that fails, the group name with the name of the
domain and the type 1C).</p><p></li><li>They tell machines that are potential browsers to become backup
browsers (using a packet that is an IP unicast but has a NetBT
destination of the group name with the name of the domain and the
type 1E).</p><p></li></ul>
In addition, master browsers get requests from clients and return
lists of backup browsers.<a name="INDEX-1910" /></p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-36-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.4.2.3. Backup browsers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1911" />Backup browsers have two functions:
they take requests from clients and return actual data, and they
participate in elections to select a master browser. Backup browsers
register a group name with the name of the domain and the type 1E.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-37-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.4.2.4. Potential browsers</h3>





Potential browsers register a group name with the name of the domain
and the type 1E. They participate in elections, but otherwise do
nothing unless they are promoted to backup browsers.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-38-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.4.2.5. Browseable server</h3>





Any machine that has a service that should show up in the browser
sends an announcement every 12 minutes to a group with the name of
the domain and the type 1D.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-39-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.4.2.6. Browser client</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1912" />A client that's in the domain
"netherworld" and wants to look up a browse list for the
domain "limbo" goes through the following steps:</p><p>





<ol><li>Sends a GetBackupListRequest via a NetBT message at UDP port 138 to
the special unique name "netherworld&lt;1d&gt;" (this is
sent as an IP broadcast and is processed only by the local master
browser).</p><p></li><li>Sends a GetBackupListRequest to the unique name
"netherworld&lt;1b&gt;" (this is sent as an IP unicast
because it's a unique name, and it goes to the domain master
browser, which is also the primary domain controller).</p><p></li><li>Gets back two lists of servers, which contain computer names.</p></li><li>Selects three of the servers listed in the browser lists provided to
it and saves them for future browsing.</p><p></li><li>Asks one of those three servers for a list of domains and workgroups;
this comes back with the names of the domains or workgroups and the
computer name of the local master browser for each one. This is a
NetBT session conversation at TCP port 139.</p><p></li><li>Sends a name resolution query for the name
"limbo&lt;1d&gt;" via broadcast to UDP port 137 (NetBT
name service). This is a special query that is done over broadcast
even on a machine that would otherwise try WINS before broadcast.</p><p></li><li>If step 6 succeeded, sends a request for a
list of members to the machine "limbo&lt;1d&gt;". This is
once again a NetBT session conversation at TCP port 139.</p><p></li><li>If there was no response to the previous request, resolves the
computer name listed as the master browser for domain
"limbo" by the machine's standard name resolution
procedure and connects to it over NetBT session for a list of
members.</p><p></li></ol>
If the client wanted a member list for its own domain, it would send
that request at step 5. If there is no
response to the initial GetBackupList requests, both requests are
retried up to three times, and if there is still no response, the
client starts an election. The client starts an election only if both
GetBackupList requests fail.<a name="INDEX-1913" /><a name="INDEX-1914" /></p><p>

<a name="ch20-40-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.3. Browser Elections</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1915" />Elections
are one of the best-documented parts of the Browser protocol; for the
details on how they work, consult almost any book on Microsoft
networking (for instance, Microsoft's <em class="emphasis">Windows NT
Server Networking Guide,</em> mentioned earlier). In outline,
the procedure is that a machine that wants an election to occur sends
a packet to the IP broadcast address with the NetBT destination of
the group with the name of the domain and the type 1E. This packet
includes several parameters that indicate the machine's
qualifications to be master browser. Each browser that gets the
packet compares those qualifications to its own and sends another
election packet if it is more qualified. A machine that sends out an
election packet without getting a response from a more qualified
machine will send out three more; once a machine has sent out four
election packets without seeing a response from a more qualified
machine, it will consider itself elected and send out a master
browser announcement.</p><p>





Because master browsers are important for the speed with which
browsing works, elections are designed to prefer more stable
machines. Election qualifications include a parameter that depends on
the machine's operating system version (Windows NT Server is
better than Windows NT Workstation is better than Windows 95), plus a
parameter specific to the browser, which you can think of as an
indication of how much the machine wants to win, and a parameter that
depends on the machine's uptime (longer uptime wins). Master
browser announcements include information about some of these
parameters (in particular, the operating system type and part of the
browser-specific information).</p><p>





There are two situations in which machines will decide to call
elections:</p><p>





<ul><li>A client will call an election if it tries to find a master browser
and cannot. In this case, it will send out an election packet that is
guaranteed to lose (all the parameters are set to zero). This is
called an <em class="emphasis">election force.</em> If the client is also
a potential browser server, it will not send out its real election
packet unless it gets one from a less-qualified candidate, or it gets
no response to repeated election force attempts.</p><p></li><li>A browser server will call an election if it receives a master
browser announcement from a less qualified machine. This should
normally happen only when a more qualified machine boots onto a
network (for instance, when a machine running Windows NT Server comes
onto a network of machines running Windows 98). However, you may see
less qualified machines boot and immediately claim to be master
servers, thereby forcing elections on otherwise stable networks.

<a name="ch20-41-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.4. Security Implications of the Windows Browser</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1917" />
<a name="INDEX-1918" />Obviously,
the Windows Browser gives out security-critical information (valid
hostnames). Less obviously, it has many fewer security implications
than WINS does. The Browser provides information in bulk, unlike
WINS, but it provides only hostname information, while WINS
coincidentally provides much more sensitive information about valid
usernames and current logins. Various sorts of denial of service and
network flooding attacks can be carried out via the Browser, but the
Browser has no equivalent of a WINS server that can be used as a
magnifier and distributor to carry attacks to networks that the
attacker is not connected to. You can spread misinformation via the
Browser, but doing so is merely confusing; unless the misinformation
is actually in NetBT name service as well, connections will simply
fail.</p><p>





This is all highly theoretical, however, since making the Windows
Browser work requires making all of NetBT work. You can't allow
the relatively safe Windows Browser without also allowing the highly
unsafe NetBT name service. If you do allow all of NetBT, adding the
Windows Browser is a relatively small decrease in security. (From a
purely practical standpoint, as opposed to a security standpoint, we
advise against it; while the security problem is small, the
administrative problem is extremely large, and the Browser almost
never works well, or even predictably, in complex
networks.)<a name="INDEX-1919" /> <a name="INDEX-1920" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-42-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.5. Packet Filtering Characteristics of the Windows Browser</h3>





The Windows Browser depends on NetBT name service at port 137 (UDP
and TCP, broadcast and unicast), NetBT datagram service at port 138
(UDP, broadcast, and unicast), and NetBT session service at port 139
(TCP, unicast only). Packet filtering characteristics of NetBT
session and datagram service are discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>; NetBT name service is discussed earlier in
this chapter.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-43-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.6. Proxying Characteristics of the Windows Browser</h3>





Because the Browser is strongly based on broadcasts, standard
proxying systems will not work with it. It is possible to use router
configurations to forward broadcasts, but this is not terribly
effective with the Browser because of the large amount of traffic
involved and the multiple port numbers used.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-44-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.4.7. Network Address Translation Characteristics of the Windows Browser</h3>





Not only does the Browser use NetBT (which has embedded IP
addresses), it also relies on many-to-many communication via
broadcasts. This is not a promising situation for network address
translation. In particular, it is not possible to conserve address
space using network address translation and the Browser, since all
hosts must be able to speak to all other hosts. Furthermore, unlike
many NetBT-based protocols, the Browser actually uses the embedded IP
addresses in some situations and will need them to be correct.</p><p>
