<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>




This book is a practical guide to building your own firewall.
It provides step-by-step explanations of how to design and install a
firewall at your site and how to configure Internet
services such as electronic mail, FTP, the World Wide Web, and others
to work with a firewall. Firewalls are complex, though, and we
can't boil everything down to simple rules. Too much depends on
exactly what hardware, operating system, and networking you are using
at your site, and what you want your users to be able to do and not
do. We've tried to give you enough rules, examples, and
resources here so you'll be able to do the rest on your own.</p><p>
What is a firewall, and what does it do for you? A
firewall is a way to restrict access between the Internet and
your internal network. You typically install a firewall at the
point of maximum leverage, the point where your network connects to
the Internet. The existence of a firewall at your site can
greatly reduce the odds that outside attackers will penetrate your
internal systems and networks. The firewall can also keep your
own users from compromising your systems by sending dangerous
information  --  unencrypted passwords and sensitive data  -- 
to the outside world.</p><p>
The attacks on Internet-connected systems we are seeing today are
more serious and more technically complex than those in the past. To
keep these attacks from compromising our systems, we need all the
help we can get. Firewalls are a highly effective way of protecting
sites from these attacks. For that reason, we strongly recommend you
include a firewall in your site's overall Internet
security plan. However, a firewall should be only one component
in that plan. It's also vital that you establish a security
policy, that you implement strong host security, and that you
consider the use of authentication and encryption devices that work
with the firewalls you install. This book will touch on each of
these topics while maintaining its focus on firewalls.</p><p>
