<a name="INDEX-222" /></a><a name="INDEX-223" /></a>Before
we discuss the details of firewalls, it's important to
understand some of the basic strategies employed in building
firewalls and in enforcing security at your site. These are not
staggering revelations; they are straightforward approaches.
They're presented here so that you can keep them in mind as you
put together a firewall solution for your site.</p><p>




<div class="sect1"><a name="ch03-1394" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">3.1. Least Privilege</h2>

<a name="INDEX-224" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-225" /></a>

Perhaps the most fundamental
principle of security (any kind of security, not just computer and
network security) is that of <em class="emphasis">least privilege</em>.
Basically, the principle of least privilege means that any object
(user, administrator, program, system, whatever) should have only the
privileges the object needs to perform its assigned tasks  --  and
no more. Least privilege is an important principle for limiting your
exposure to attacks and for limiting the damage caused by particular
attacks.</p><p>





Some car manufacturers set up their locks so that one key works the
doors and the ignition, and a different key works the glove
compartment and the trunk; that way, you can enforce least privilege
by giving a parking lot attendant the ability to park the car without
the ability to get at things stored in the trunk. Many people use
splittable key chains, for the same reason. You can enforce least
privilege by giving someone the key to your car but not the key to
your house as well.</p><p>





In the Internet context, the examples are endless. Every user
probably doesn't need to access every Internet service. Every
user probably doesn't need to modify (or even read) every file
on your system. Every user probably doesn't need to know the
machine's administrative password. Every system administrator
probably doesn't need to know the administrative passwords for
all systems. Every system probably doesn't need to access every
other system's files.</p><p>





Unlike car manufacturers, most operating system vendors do not
configure their operating systems with least privilege by default. It
is common for them to be in a "most privileged" mode when
connected to a network out of the box or during an operating system
installation. Applying the principle of least privilege suggests that
you should explore ways to reduce the privileges required for various
operations. For example:</p><p>





<ul><li><a name="INDEX-226" /></a>Don't give a
user administrative rights for a system if all she needs to do is
reset the print system. Instead, provide a way to reset the print
system without administrative rights (under Unix, it involves a
special program of some sort; under NT, it involves giving that user
the privileges required, usually by making the account a member of
the Print Operators group).</p><p></li><li>Don't make a program run as a user with general privileges if
all it needs to do is write to one protected file. Instead, make the
file group-writable to some group and make the program run as a
member of that group rather than as a highly privileged user.</p><p></li><li><a name="INDEX-227" /></a>Don't have
your internal systems trust one of your firewall machines just so it
can do backups. Instead, make the firewall machine trust the internal
system, or, better yet, put a local tape drive on the firewall
machine so that it can do its own backups.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-228" /></a>Many of the common
security problems on the Internet can be viewed as failures to follow
the principle of least privilege. For example, any number of security
problems have been and continue to be discovered in Sendmail, which
is a big, complex program; any such program is going to have bugs in
it. The problem is that Sendmail runs (at least some of the time)
<em class="emphasis">setuid</em> to root; many of the attacks against
Sendmail take advantage of this. Because it runs as root, Sendmail is
a high-value target that gets a lot of attention from attackers; the
fact that it's a complex program just makes their jobs easier.
This implies both that privileged programs should be as simple as
possible and that, if a complex program requires privileges, you
should look for ways to separate and isolate the pieces that need
privileges from the complex parts.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-5" /></a>[5]It's
important to realize that Sendmail is far from the only example we
could cite; you can find similar problems in almost any large,
complex, privileged piece of software.</p><p>




</blockquote>





any of the solutions you'll employ in protecting your site are
tactics for enforcing the strategy of least privilege. For example, a
packet filtering system is designed to allow in only packets for the
services you want. Running insecure programs in an environment where
only the privileges the programs absolutely need are available to
them (e.g., a machine that's been stripped down in one way or
another) is another example; this is the essence of a bastion host.</p><p>





There are two problems with trying to enforce least privilege. First,
it can be complex to implement when it isn't already a design
feature of the programs and protocols you're using. Trying to
add it on may be very difficult to get right. Some of the cars that
try to implement least privilege with separate keys for the trunk and
the ignition have remote trunk release buttons that are accessible
without the keys, or fold-down rear seats that allow you to access
the trunk without opening it the traditional way at all. You need to
be very careful to be sure that you've actually succeeded in
implementing least privilege.</p><p>





Second, you may end up implementing something less than least
privilege. Some cars have the gas cap release in the glove
compartment. That's intended to keep parking lot attendants
from siphoning off your gas, but if you lend a friend your car, you
probably want him or her to be able to fill it up with gas. If you
give your friend only the ignition key, you're giving your
friend less than the minimum privilege you want him or her to have
(because your friend won't be able to fill up the gas tank),
but adding the key to the trunk and the glove compartment may give
your friend more privilege than you want.</p><p>





You may find similar effects with computer implementations of least
privilege. Trying to enforce least privilege on people, rather than
programs, can be particularly dangerous. You can predict fairly well
what permissions a mail server is going to need to do its job; human
beings are less predictable and more likely to become annoyed and
dangerous if they can't do what they want. Be very careful to
avoid turning your users into your enemies.<a name="INDEX-229" /></a><a name="INDEX-230" /></a></p><p>
