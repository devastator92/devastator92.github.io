<h2 class="sect1">13.5. Choosing Security-Critical Programs</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1258" /> <a name="INDEX-1259" />The
world of Internet servers is evolving rapidly, and you may find that
you want to use a server that has not been mentioned here in a
security-critical position. How do you figure out whether or not it
is secure?</p><p>





<a name="ch13-23-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.5.1. My Product Is Secure Because  . . .</h3>





The first step is to discount any advertising statements you may have
heard about it. You may hear people claim that their server is secure
because:</p><p>





<ul><li>It contains no publicly available code, so it's secret.</p><p></li><li>It contains publicly available code, so it's been well reviewed.</p></li><li><p>It is built entirely from scratch, so it didn't inherit any
bugs from any other products.</p><p></li><li>It is built on an old, well-tested code base.</p></li><li>It doesn't run as root (under Unix) or as Administrator or
LocalSystem (under Windows NT).</p><p></li><li>It doesn't run under Unix.</p></li><li>It doesn't run on a Microsoft operating system.</p></li><li><p>There are no known attacks against it.</p></li><li><p>It uses public key cryptography (or some other secure-sounding
technology).</p><p></li></ul>
None of these things guarantees security or reliability. Horrible
security bugs have been found in programs with all these
characteristics.</p><p>





<a name="ch13-24-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.1. It contains no publicly available code, so it's secret</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1260" />People don't need to be able to
see the code to a program in order to find problems with it. In fact,
most attacks are found by trying attack methods that worked on
similar programs, watching what the program does, or looking for
vulnerabilities in the protocol, none of which require access to the
source code. It is also possible to reverse-engineer an application
to find out exactly how it was written. This can take a considerable
amount of time, but even if you are not willing to spend the time, it
doesn't mean that attackers feel the same way. Attackers are
also unlikely to obey any software license agreements that prohibit
reverse engineering.</p><p>





In addition, some vendors who make this claim apply extremely narrow
definitions of "publicly available code". For instance,
they may in fact use licensed code that is distributed in source
format and is free for noncommercial use. Check copyright
acknowledgments -- a program that includes copyright
acknowledgments for the University of California Board of Regents,
for instance, almost certainly includes code from some version of the
Berkeley Unix operating system, which is widely available.
There's nothing wrong with that, but if you want to use
something based on secret source code, you deserve to get what
you're paying for.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-25-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.2. It contains publicly available code, so it's been well reviewed</h3>





Publicly available code could be well reviewed, but there's no
guarantee. Thousands of people can read publicly available code, but
most of them don't. In any case, reviewing code after
it's written isn't a terribly effective way of ensuring
its security; good design and testing are far more efficient.</p><p>





People also point out that publicly available code gets more bug
fixes and more rapid bug fixes than most privately held code; this is
true, but this increased rate of change also adds new bugs.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-26-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.3. It is built entirely from scratch, so it didn't inherit any bugs from any other products</h3>





No code is bug free. Starting from scratch replaces the old bugs with
new bugs. They might be less harmful or more harmful. They might also
be identical; people tend to think along the same lines, so
it's not uncommon for different programmers to produce the same
bug. (See Knight, Leveson, and St. Jean, "A Large-Scale
Experiment in N-Version Programming," Fault-Tolerant Computing
Systems Conference 15, for an actual experience with common bugs.)</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-27-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.4. It is built on an old, well-tested code base</h3>





New problems show up in old code all the time. Worse yet, old
problems that hadn't been exploited yet suddenly become
exploitable. Something that's been around for a long time
probably isn't vulnerable to attacks that used to be popular,
but that doesn't predict much about its resistance to future
attacks.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-28-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.5. It doesn't run as root/Administrator/LocalSystem</h3>





A program that doesn't run as one of the well-known privileged
accounts may be safer than one that does. At the very least, if it
runs amok, it won't have complete control of your entire
computer. However, that's a very long distance from actually
being safe. For instance, no matter what user is involved, a mail
delivery system has to be able to write mail into users'
mailboxes. If the mail delivery system can be subverted, it can be
used to fill up disks or forge email, no matter what account it runs
as. Many mail systems have more power than that.</p><p>





There are two separate problems with services that are run as
"unprivileged" users. The first is that the privileges
needed for the service to function carry risks with them. A mail
system must be able to deliver mail, and that's inherently
risky. The second is that few operating systems let you control
privileges so precisely that you can give a service exactly the
privileges that it needs. The ability to deliver mail often comes
with the ability to write files to all sorts of other places, for
instance. Many programs introduce a third problem by creating
accounts to run the service and failing to turn off default
privileges that are unneeded. For instance, most programs that create
special accounts to run the service fail to turn off the ability for
their special accounts to log in. Programs rarely need to log in, but
attackers often do.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-29-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.6. It doesn't run under Unix, or it doesn't run on a Microsoft operating system</h3>





People produce dozens of reasons why other operating systems are less
secure than their favorite one. (Unix source code is widely available
to attackers! Microsoft source code is too big! The Unix root concept
is inherently insecure! Windows NT's layered model isn't
any better!) The fact is, almost all of these arguments have a grain
of truth. Both Unix and Windows NT have serious design flaws as
secure operating systems; so does every other popular operating
system.</p><p>





Nonetheless, it's possible to write secure software on almost
any operating system, with enough effort, and it's easy to
write insecure software on any operating system. In some
circumstances, one operating system may be better matched to the
service you want to provide than another, but most of the time, the
security of a service depends on the effort that goes into securing
it, both at design and at deployment.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-30-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.7. There are no known attacks against it</h3>





Something can have no known attacks without being at all safe. It
might not have an installed base large enough to attract attackers;
it might be vulnerable but usually installed in conjunction with
something easier to attack; it might just not have been around long
enough for anybody to get around to it; it might have known flaws
that are difficult enough to exploit that nobody has yet implemented
attacks for them. All of these conditions are temporary.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-31-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.1.8. It uses public key cryptography (or some other secure-sounding technology)</h3>





As of this writing, public key cryptography is a popular victim for
this kind of argument because most people don't understand much
about how it works, but they know it's supposed to be exciting
and secure. You therefore see firewall products that say
they're secure because they use public key cryptography, but
that don't say what specific form of public key cryptography
and what they use it for. This is like toasters that claim that they
make perfect toast every time because of "digital processing
technology". They can be digitally processing anything from the
time delay to the temperature to the degree of color-change in the
bread, and a digital timer will burn your toast just as often as an
analog one.</p><p>





Similarly, there's good public key cryptography, bad public key
cryptography, and irrelevant public key cryptography. Merely adding
public key cryptography to some random part of a product won't
make it secure. The same is true of any other technology, no matter
how exciting it is. A supplier who makes this sort of claim should be
prepared to back it up by providing details of what the technology
does, where it's used, and how it matters.</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-32-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.5.2. Their Product Is Insecure Because  . . .</h3>





You'll also get people who claim that other people's
software is insecure (and therefore unusable or worse than their
competing product) because:</p><p>





<ul><li>It's been mentioned in a CERT-CC advisory or on a web site
listing vulnerabilities.</p><p></li><li>It's publicly available.</p></li><li>It's been successfully attacked.</p></li></ul>
<a name="ch13-33-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.2.1. It's been mentioned in a CERT-CC advisory or on a web site listing vulnerabilities</h3>





CERT-CC issues advisories for programs that are supposed to be
secure, but that have known problems for which fixes are available
from the supplier. While it's always unfortunate to have a
problem show up, if there's a CERT-CC advisory for it, at least
you know that the problem was unintentional and the vendor has taken
steps to fix it. A program with no CERT-CC advisories might have no
problems; but it might also be completely insecure by design, be
distributed by a vendor who never fixes security problems, or have
problems that were never reported to CERT-CC. Since CERT-CC is
relatively inactive outside of the Unix world, problems on non-Unix
platforms are less likely to show up there, but they still exist.</p><p>





Other lists of vulnerabilities are often a better reflection of
actual risks, since they will list problems that the vendor has
chosen to ignore and problems that are there by design. On the other
hand, they're still very much a popularity contest. The
"exploit lists" kept by attackers, and people trying to
keep up with them, focus heavily on attacks that provide the most
compromises for the least effort. That means that popular programs
are mentioned often, and unpopular programs don't get much
publicity, even if the popular programs are much more secure than the
unpopular ones.</p><p>





In addition, people who use this argument often provide big scary
numbers without putting them in context; what does it mean if you say
that a given web site lists 27 vulnerabilities in a program? If the
web site is carefully run by a single administrator, that might be 27
separate vulnerabilities; if it's not, it may be the same 9
vulnerabilities reported three times each. In either case, it's
not very interesting if competing programs have 270!</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-34-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.2.2. It's publicly available</h3>





We've already argued that code doesn't magically become
secure by being made available for inspection. The other side of that
argument is that it doesn't magically become insecure, either.
A well-written program doesn't have the kind of bugs that make
it vulnerable to attack just because people have read the code. (And
most attackers don't actually read code any more frequently
than defenders do -- in both cases, the conscientious and careful
read the code, and the vast majority of people just compile it and
hope.)</p><p>





In general, publicly available code is modified faster than private
code, which means that security problems are fixed more rapidly when
they are found. This higher rate of change has downsides, which we
discussed earlier, but it also means that you are less likely to be
vulnerable to old bugs.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-35-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.2.3. It's been successfully attacked</h3>





Obviously, you don't want to install software that people
already know how to attack. However, what you should pay the most
attention to is not attacks but the response to them. A successful
attack (even a very high-profile and public successful attack) may
not be important if the problem was novel and rapidly fixed. A
pattern where variations on the same problem show up repeatedly or
where the supplier is slow to fix problems is genuinely worrisome,
but a single successful attack usually isn't, even if it makes
a national newspaper.</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-36-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.5.3. Real Indicators of Security</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1261" />Any of the following
things should increase your comfort:</p><p>





<ul><li>Security was one of the design criteria.</p><p></li><li>The supplier appears to be aware of major types of security problems
and can speak to how they have been avoided.</p><p></li><li>It is possible for you to review the code.</p></li><li>Somebody you know and trust actually has reviewed the code.</p></li><li><p>A process is in place to distribute notifications of security
problems and updates to the server.</p><p></li><li>The server fully implements a recent (but accepted) version of the
protocol.</p><p></li><li>The program uses standard error-logging mechanisms
(<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> under Unix, the Event Viewer under
Windows NT).</p><p></li><li>There is a secure software distribution mechanism.</p></li></ul>
<a name="ch13-37-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.1. Security was one of the design criteria</h3>





The first step towards making a secure program is trying to make one.
It's not something you can achieve by accident. The supplier
should have convincing evidence that security was kept in mind at the
design stage, and that the kind of security they had in mind is the
same kind that you have in mind. It's not enough for
"security" to be a checkbox item on a list somewhere. Ask
what they were trying to secure, and how this affected the final
product.</p><p>





For instance, a mail system may list "security" as a goal
because it incorporates anti-spamming features or facilitates
encryption of mail messages as they pass across the Internet. Those
are both nice security goals, but they don't address the
security of the server itself if an attacker starts sending it evil
commands.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-38-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.2. The supplier can discuss how major security problems were avoided</h3>





Even if you're trying to be secure, you can't get there
if you don't know how. Somebody associated with your supplier
and responsible for the program should be able to intelligently
discuss the risks involved, and what was done about them. For
instance, if the program takes user-supplied input, somebody should
be able to explain to you what's been done to avoid buffer
overflow problems.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-39-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.3. It is possible for you to review the code</h3>





Security through obscurity is often better than no security at all,
but it's not a viable long-term strategy. If there is no way
for anybody to see the code, ever, even a bona-fide expert who has
signed a nondisclosure agreement and is acting on behalf of a
customer, you should be suspicious. It's perfectly reasonable
for people to protect their trade secrets, and it's also
reasonable for people to object to having sensitive code examined by
people who aren't able to evaluate it anyway (for instance,
it's unlikely that most people can do an adequate job of
evaluating the strength of encryption algorithms). However, if
you're willing to provide somebody who's competent to do
the evaluation, and to provide strong protection for trade secrets,
you should be allowed to review the code. Code that can't stand
up to this sort of evaluation will not stand the test of time,
either.</p><p>





You may not be able and willing to review the code under appropriate
conditions. That's usually OK, but you should at least verify
that there is some procedure for code review.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-40-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.4. Somebody you know and trust actually has reviewed the code</h3>





It doesn't matter how many people could look at a piece of
software if nobody ever does. If it's practical to do so,
it's wise to make the investment to have somebody reasonably
knowledgeable and trustworthy actually look at the code. While
anybody could review open source, very few people do. It's
relatively cheap and easy, and any competent programmer can at least
tell you whether it's well-written code. Don't assume
that somebody else has done this.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-41-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.5. There is a security notification and update procedure</h3>





All programs eventually have security problems. A well-defined
process should be in place for notifying the supplier of security
problems and for getting notifications and updates from them. If the
supplier has been around for any significant amount of time, there
should be a positive track record, showing that they react to
reported problems promptly and reasonably.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-42-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.6. The server implements a recent (but accepted) version of the protocol</h3>





You can have problems with protocols, not just with the programs that
implement them. In order to have some confidence in the security of
the protocol, it's helpful to have an implementation of an
accepted, standard protocol in a relatively recent version. You want
an accepted and/or standard protocol so that you know that the
protocol design has been reviewed; you want a relatively recent
version so that you know that old problems have been fixed. You
don't want custom protocols, or experimental or novel versions
of standard protocols, if you can avoid them. Protocol design is
tricky, few suppliers do a competent job in-house, and almost nobody
gets a protocol right on the first try.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-43-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.7. The program uses standard error-logging mechanisms</h3>





In order to secure something, you need to manage it. Using standard
logging mechanisms makes programs much easier to manage; you can
simply integrate them into your existing log management and alerting
tools. Nonstandard logging not only interferes with your ability to
find messages, it also runs the risk of introducing new security
holes (what if an attacker uses the logging to fill your disk?).</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-44-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.5.3.8. There is a secure software distribution mechanism</h3>





You should have some confidence that the version of the software you
have is the correct version. In the case of software that you
download across the Internet, this means that it should have a
verifiable digital signature (even if it is commercial software!).</p><p>





ore subtly, if you're getting a complex commercial package,
you should be able to trust the distribution and release mechanism,
and know that you have a complete and correct version with a
retrievable version number. If your commercial vendor ships you a
writable CD burned just for you and then advises you to FTP some
patches, you need to know that some testing, integration, and
versioning is going on. If they don't digitally sign everything
and provide signatures to compare to, they should at least be able to
provide an inventory list showing all the files in the distribution
with sizes, dates, and version numbers.<a name="INDEX-1262" /><a name="INDEX-1263" /> <a name="INDEX-1264" /></p><p>
