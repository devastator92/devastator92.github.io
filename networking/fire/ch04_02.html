<h2 class="sect1">4.2. IP</h2>





<a name="INDEX-280" />IP serves as a common middle
ground for the Internet. It can have many different layers below it,
such as Ethernet, token ring, FDDI, PPP, or carrier pigeon.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a> IP can have many other protocols layered
on top of it, with TCP, UDP, and ICMP being by far the most common,
at least outside of research environments. In this section, we
discuss the special characteristics of IP relevant to packet
filtering.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-8" />[8]See RFC 1149, dated 1 April 1990, which defines the Avian
Transport Protocol; RFCs dated 1 April are usually worth
reading.</p><p>

<a name="ch04-2-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.1. IP Multicast and Broadcast</h3>





ost IP packets are what are called <em class="emphasis">unicast</em>;
they are sent to an individual destination host. IP packets may also
be <em class="emphasis">multicast</em> (sent to a group of hosts) or
<em class="emphasis">broadcast</em> (intended for every host that can
receive them). Multicast packets are like memos, which are sent to a
group of people ("Employees in the purchasing department"
or "People working on the Ishkabibble project" or
"Potential softball players"); their destination is a
group of hosts that ought to be interested in the information.
Broadcast packets are like announcements made on overhead speakers;
they are used when everybody needs the information ("The
building is on fire, evacuate now") or when the message's
sender can't determine which particular destination should get
the message, but believes that the destination will be able to figure
it out ("The green Honda with license plate 4DZM362 has its
lights on").</p><p>





The purpose of multicasting is to create efficiency. Unlike a memo, a
multicast packet is a single object. If 7, or 17, or 70 hosts want
the same information, a multicast packet allows you to get it to them
by sending just one packet, instead of one packet each. A broadcast
packet would give you the same savings in network resources, but it
would waste computing time on the uninterested machines that would
have to process the packet in order to decide it was irrelevant and
reject it.</p><p>





Note that multicast and broadcast addresses are meant as destination
addresses, not as source addresses. A machine may use a broadcast
address as a source address only if it does not have a legitimate
source address and is trying to get one (see <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>, for more information about DHCP, which may
use this mechanism). Otherwise, multicast and broadcast source
addresses are generally signs of an attacker who is using a
destination machine as an amplifier. If a packet has a broadcast
source address and a unicast destination address, any reply to it
will have a unicast source address and a broadcast destination; thus,
an attacker who uses a broadcast source can cause another machine to
do the broadcasting.</p><p>





This is a good deal for the attacker because it's rare that
packets with a broadcast destination are allowed to cross a firewall
(or, in fact, any router). The attacker probably wouldn't be
able to get at a large number of hosts without using this kind of
dirty trick. You don't want broadcast information from other
networks; it's not relevant to your life, and it may be
dangerous (either because it's incorrect for your network, or
because it allows attackers to gather information about your
network). Routers are sometimes configured to pass some or all
broadcasts between networks that are part of the same organization,
because some protocols rely on broadcasts to distribute information.
This is tricky to get right and tends to result in overloaded
networks and hosts, but it is more acceptable than passing broadcasts
to or from the Internet.</p><p>





Your firewall should therefore refuse to pass packets with broadcast
destinations and packets with multicast or broadcast source
addresses.</p><p>

<a name="ch04-4472" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.2. IP Options</h3>





As we saw in the previous discussion of the IP layer, IP headers
include an options field, which is usually empty. In its design, the
IP options field was intended as a place for special information or
handling instructions that didn't have a specific field of
their own in the header. However, TCP/IP's designers did such a
good job of providing fields for everything necessary that the
options field is almost always empty. In practice, IP options are
very seldom used except for break-in attempts and (very rarely) for
network debugging.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-281" /><a name="INDEX-282" />
<a name="INDEX-283" />The
most common IP option a firewall would be confronted with is the IP
source route option. Source routing lets the source of a packet
specify the route the packet is supposed to take to its destination,
rather than letting each router along the way use its routing tables
to decide where to send the packet next. Source routing is supposed
to override the instructions in the routing tables. In theory, the
source routing option is useful for working around routers with
broken or incorrect routing tables; if you know the route that the
packet should take, but the routing tables are broken, you can
override the bad information in the routing tables by specifying
appropriate IP source route options on all your packets. In practice
though, source routing is commonly used only by attackers who are
attempting to circumvent security measures by causing packets to
follow unexpected paths.</p><p>





This is in fact a circular problem; several researchers have proposed
interesting uses of source routing, which are impossible to use
widely because source routing is commonly disabled -- because
it's useful for nothing but attacks. This situation interferes
considerably with widespread use of most solutions for mobile IP
(allowing machines to move from place to place while keeping a fixed
IP address).</p><p>





Some packet filtering systems take the approach of dropping any
packet that has any IP option set, without even trying to figure out
what the option is or what it means; this doesn't usually cause
significant problems.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch04-4492" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.3. IP Fragmentation</h3>





<a name="INDEX-284" /><a name="INDEX-285" /><a name="INDEX-286" />Another
IP-level consideration for packet filtering is fragmentation. One of
the features of IP is its ability to divide a large packet that
otherwise couldn't traverse some network link (because of
limitations on packet size along that link) into smaller packets,
called <em class="emphasis">fragments</em>, which can traverse that link.
The fragments are then reassembled into the full packet by the
destination machine (not by the machine at the other end of the
limited link; once a packet is fragmented, it normally stays
fragmented until it reaches its destination).</p><p>





Normally, any router can decide to fragment a packet. A flag in the
IP header can be used to prevent routers from fragmenting packets.
Originally, this wasn't much used, because a router that needs
to fragment a packet but is forbidden to do so will have to reject
the packet, and communication will fail, which is generally less
desirable than having the packet fragmented. However, there is now a
system called path maximum transmission unit (MTU) discovery that
uses the flag that prevents fragmentation.</p><p>





Path MTU discovery is a way for systems to determine what is the
largest packet that can be sent to another machine without getting
fragmented. Large unfragmented packets are more efficient than small
packets, but if packets have to be broken up later in the process,
this will significantly decrease transfer speed. Therefore, maximum
efficiency depends on knowing how big to make the packets, but that
depends on all the network links between the machines. Neither
machine has any way to know what the answer is (and, in fact, it may
vary from moment to moment). In order to discover the limit, systems
can send out packets with "don't fragment" set and
look for the error response that says that the packet has been
dropped because it was too big but could not be fragmented. If
there's an error, the machine reduces the packet size; if
there's no error, it increases it. This adds some extra expense
at the beginning of a connection, but for a connection that transmits
a significant amount of data across a network that includes a limited
link, the overall transmission time will probably be improved despite
the intentionally lost packets. However, path MTU discovery will fail
catastrophically if the error messages (which are ICMP messages,
discussed later in this chapter) are not correctly returned (for
instance, if your firewall drops them).</p><p>





IP fragmentation is illustrated in <a href="ch04_02.html#ch04-63867">Figure 4-3</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch04-63867" /><div class="figure"><img height="261" alt="Figure 4-3" src="figs/fire2.0403.gif" width="436" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-3. Data fragmentation</h4>

From a packet filtering point of view, the problem with fragmentation
is that only the first fragment will contain the header information
from higher-level protocols, like TCP, that the packet filtering
system needs in order to decide whether or not to allow the full
packet. Originally, the common packet filtering approach to dealing
with fragmentation was to allow any non-first fragments through and
to do packet filtering only on the first fragment of a packet. This
was considered safe because if the packet filtering decides to drop
the first fragment, the destination system will not be able to
reassemble the rest of the fragments into the original packet,
regardless of how many of the rest of the fragments it receives. If
it can't reconstruct the original packet, the partially
reassembled packet will not be accepted.</p><p>





However, there are still problems with fragmented packets. If you
pass all non-first fragments, the destination host will hold the
fragments in memory for a while, waiting to see if it gets the
missing piece; this makes it possible for attackers to use fragmented
packets in a denial of service attack. When the destination host
gives up on reassembling the packet, it will send an ICMP
"packet reassembly time expired" message back to the
source host, which will tell an attacker that the host exists and why
the connection didn't succeed.</p><p>





In addition, attackers can use specially fragmented packets to
conceal data. Each fragment contains information about where the data
it contains starts and ends. Normally, each one starts after the last
one ended. However, an attacker can construct packets where fragments
actually overlap, and contain the same data addresses. This does not
happen in normal operation; it can happen only when bugs or attackers
are involved, and attackers are by far the most likely cause.</p><p>





Operating systems differ in their response to overlapping fragments.
Because overlapping fragments are abnormal, many operating systems
respond very badly to them and may reassemble them into invalid
packets, with the expected sorts of unfortunate results up to and
including operating system crashes. When they are reassembled, there
are differences in whether the first or second fragment's data
is kept; these differences can be increased by sending the fragments
out of order. Some machines prefer the first version received, others
the most recent version received, others the numerically first, and
still others the numerically last. This makes it nearly impossible
for packet filtering or intrusion detection systems to figure out
what data the receiving system will actually see if and when the
fragments are reassembled.</p><p>





Three kinds of attacks are made possible by overlapping fragments:</p><p>





<ul><li>Simple denial of service attacks against hosts with poor responses to
overlapping fragments.</p><p></li><li>Information-hiding attacks. If an attacker knows that virus
detectors, intrusion detection systems, or other systems that pay
attention to the content of packets are in use and can determine what
assembly method the systems use for overlapping fragments, the
attacker can construct overlapping fragments that will obscure
content from the watching systems.</p><p></li><li>Attacks that get information to otherwise blocked ports. An attacker
can construct a packet with acceptable headers in the first fragment
but then overlap the next fragment so that it also has headers in it.
Since packet filters don't expect TCP headers in non-first
fragments, they won't filter on them, and the headers
don't need to be acceptable. <a href="ch04_02.html#ch04-96254">Figure 4-4</a> shows
overlapped fragments.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="ch04-96254" /><div class="figure"><img height="375" alt="Figure 4-4" src="figs/fire2.0404.gif" width="441" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-4. Overlapping fragments</h4>

There are other, special problems with passing outbound fragments.
Outbound fragments could conceivably contain data you don't
want to release to the world. For example, an outbound NFS packet
would almost certainly be fragmented, and if the file were
confidential, that information would be released. If this happens by
accident, it's unlikely to be a problem; people do not
generally hang around looking at the data in random packets going by
just in case there's something interesting in them. You could
wait a very long time for somebody to accidentally send a fragment
out with interesting data in it.</p><p>





If somebody inside intentionally uses fragmentation to transmit data,
you have hostile users within the firewall, and no firewall can deal
successfully with insiders. (They probably aren't very clever
hostile users, though, because there are easier ways to get data
out.)</p><p>





However, there is one other situation in which outbound fragments
could carry data: if you have decided to deal with some vulnerability
by blocking outbound responses to something (instead of attempting to
block the original request on the incoming side, which would be a
better idea), and the reply is fragmented. In this situation,
non-first fragments of the reply will get out, and the attacker has
reason to expect them and look for them. You can deal with this by
being careful to filter out requests and by not relying on filtering
out the replies.</p><p>





Because of these many and varied problems with fragmentation, you
should look for a packet filter that does fragment reassembly; rather
than either permitting or denying fragments, the packet filter should
reassemble the packet locally (and, if necessary, refragment it
before sending it on). This will increase the load on the firewall
somewhat, but it protects against all fragmentation-based risks and
attacks, except those the firewall itself is vulnerable to (for
instance, denial of service attacks based on sending non-first
fragments until the firewall runs out of memory).</p><p>





If you cannot do fragment reassembly, your safest option is to reject
all non-first fragments. This may destroy connections that otherwise
would have succeeded, but it is the lesser of two evils. Denying
fragments will cause some connections to fail mysteriously, which is
extremely unpleasant to debug. On the other hand, allowing them will
open you to a variety of attacks that are widely exploited on the
Internet. Fortunately, fragmented packets are becoming rarer as the
use of path MTU discovery increases.<a name="INDEX-287" /><a name="INDEX-288" /><a name="INDEX-289" /><a name="INDEX-290" /></p><p>
