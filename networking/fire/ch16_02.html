<h2 class="sect1">16.2. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1543" />On the Internet,
electronic mail exchange between mail servers is handled with SMTP. A
host's SMTP server accepts mail and examines the destination
address to decide whether to deliver the mail locally or to forward
it on to some other machine. If it decides to deliver the mail
locally, it recodes the mail headers and delivery address into the
proper form for the local delivery program, and it then hands the
mail to that program. If it decides to forward the mail to another
machine, it modifies the headers and contacts that machine (usually
via SMTP, but sometimes via UUCP or another protocol) and forwards
the mail.</p><p>





SMTP is a store-and-forward system, and such systems are well suited
to firewall applications, particularly those using proxy services. In
<a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>, <a href="ch09_02.html#ch09-38052">Figure 9-2</a> shows how
mail sent from an individual user's workstation is directed
initially to a gateway system before leaving the user's own
network. Mail entering a network goes to a gateway system on that
network before being distributed to individual users on other hosts.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.1. Extended SMTP (ESMTP)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1544" /> <a name="INDEX-1545" />Extended SMTP (ESMTP) is an update to
SMTP. It runs on the same port as regular SMTP, and ESMTP clients and
servers are compatible with SMTP clients and servers. ESMTP is not
actually a new protocol but a mechanism for supporting extensions to
SMTP. Different mail servers implement different extensions; you
can't tell what features a mailer has just by knowing that it
supports ESMTP. In fact, since all the ESMTP extensions are optional,
there are mail servers that speak ESMTP without implementing any new
functions that affect mail handling.</p><p>





The ESMTP mechanism presents no security advantages or problems
different from the ones found with SMTP; it is the individual
extensions that are important. From a security perspective, STARTTLS
is the most interesting extension, and it is discussed in the next
section.</p><p>





You may want to have an ESMTP-capable server that supports
performance and administrative extensions. In that case, you should
make certain to pick a mail server for your bastion host that
supports the particular extensions that you are interested
in.<a name="INDEX-1546" />

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.2. TLS/SSL, SSMTP, and STARTTLS</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1548" />
<a name="INDEX-1549" />
<a name="INDEX-1550" />
<a name="INDEX-1551" />SMTP passes all
traffic over the network unencrypted. As we discussed earlier,
various systems for encrypting and digitally signing message bodies
work without changing the SMTP protocol itself. These techniques do
not protect message headers, which include the email addresses of the
sender and recipients, the time, and frequently the message subject.
People have therefore suggested running SMTP over SSL or TLS (TLS and
SSL are discussed further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>), which
would encrypt the entire connection, including all mail headers, and
would also authenticate the mail relay machines.</p><p>





Several methods have been proposed, including using a separate TCP
port for a new SSMTP protocol. Although a port has been reserved for
use by SSMTP, very few mail servers support it, and it is not a
standard. An alternative that is being proposed as a standard is
based upon an ESMTP extension called STARTTLS. When a client
discovers that an ESMTP server supports the extension, it issues the
STARTTLS command and negotiates a TLS session. The client and server
then begin a completely new authenticated and encrypted dialog.
STARTTLS is supported by some current mail servers, but not many.</p><p>





As we have already discussed, single-hop encryption and
authentication are not very useful for electronic mail. SMTP is no
exception, and STARTTLS or SSMTP will be useful to you only in
situations where you are directly accepting mail from known, trusted
hosts (business partners or your own users, for instance).</p><p>

<a name="FOOTNOTE-57" />[57]ACK is not set on the first packet of this type
(establishing connection) but will be set on the rest.</p><p>
</blockquote>

Normally, you want to configure your packet filters to allow incoming
and outgoing SMTP only between external hosts and the bastion host,
and between the bastion host and your internal mail servers.</p><p>





Do not allow external hosts to contact random internal hosts via
SMTP. As we've discussed, only specially configured hosts can
safely accept SMTP connections.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1552" />If you cannot filter
on the ACK bit, you cannot safely allow outgoing SMTP connections
directly from random internal hosts, as we demonstrate in the final
example in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>. If you can filter on the ACK
bit, you can allow internal hosts to send mail to external hosts, but
it isn't advisable to do so. Although it shouldn't
increase your vulnerability to direct attacks from the outside, it
dramatically increases your vulnerability to internal problems,
including Trojan horse programs that users may be running
unintentionally. Because port 25 is frequently allowed through packet
filtering systems, it is one of the most popular ports to use for
Trojan horses and other attempts to subvert firewalls.</p><p>





Allowing outgoing SMTP from all internal hosts also increases the
likelihood that you're going to send misformatted mail, because
the mail (mis)configurations of all your machines will be visible to
the external world, and the chances that all your internal machines
do all the right things with mail headers (particularly in adding
fully qualified domain names to addresses and
"Message-ID:" lines) are low. Sending outgoing mail via
the bastion host allows the bastion host the opportunity to clean up
the headers before the mail is loosed upon the world.</p><p>





Finally, if you allow all internal hosts to send mail to the outside,
you are creating a configuration where the same machines handle
internal and external mail delivery. The dangers of this sort of
configuration are discussed later in <a href="ch16_02.html#ch16-8147">Section 16.2.6, "Configuring SMTP to Work with a Firewall"</a>.</p><p>

<a name="ch16-8128" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.2.4. Proxying Characteristics of SMTP</h3>





Because SMTP is a store-and-forward protocol, it's inherently
suited to proxying. Since any SMTP server can be a proxy, it's
rare to set up separate proxying for it. Instead, most sites direct
SMTP connections to a bastion host running a secure SMTP server that
is the proxy.</p><p>





Dedicated firewall products that provide proxying may proxy SMTP
(they can't reasonably be expected to run a full SMTP server).
This is straightforward to configure because SMTP uses a single
connection. In this configuration, it's not unreasonable to
continue to direct the proxied SMTP connections to a single secured
SMTP server on a bastion host that acts as a second proxy. Proxying
protects you from unwanted connections, but not from misuses of
connections; you don't want to let external hosts talk to a
standard unsecured SMTP server, even through a proxy.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch16-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.2.5. Network Address Translation Characteristics of SMTP</h3>





SMTP does not use embedded IP addresses, but outgoing SMTP
connections will include the internal hostname as a greeting to the
destination server. In addition, some naive mechanisms used to
prevent mail relaying will refuse mail unless the IP address matches
the host greeting and passes a double-reverse DNS lookup.
(Double-reverse DNS lookups are discussed in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>.) These problems can be avoided by using a
small number of servers to relay all mail to the outside, setting up
static translations for them, and advertising those names externally
with the translated addresses.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.6. Configuring SMTP to Work with a Firewall</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1553" /><a name="INDEX-1554" /><a name="INDEX-1555" />Because you
want to send all your incoming mail through your bastion host, you
need to configure your mail system in a special way. Here are the
important steps to follow:</p><p>





<ol><li><a name="INDEX-1556" />Use
DNS Mail Exchange (MX) records to specify that all your incoming mail
should be directed to your bastion host(s).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-58">[58]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-58" />[58]For a
detailed discussion of MX records, how they work, and how to use
them, see the books <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network
Administration</em>, by Craig Hunt
(O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1998) and <em class="emphasis">DNS and
BIND</em>, by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, 1998). Both of these books are also available in
specialized versions for Windows NT; further details are in <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>.</p><p>




</blockquote></li><li><a name="INDEX-1557" /><a name="INDEX-1558" />Configure
the mailer on the bastion host to check the destination address on
mail it receives. If the mail is being sent from an internal host to
an external host, the bastion host should process the mail as usual;
if the mail is to an internal host, the bastion host should simply
pass the mail to an internal mail server for processing, rather than
attempt to deliver the mail itself. (If the mail is from an external
host to an external host, the mailer should reject it altogether; see
the section on preventing mail relaying, earlier in this chapter.)</p><p></li><li>Configure your internal systems to send all outgoing mail to the
bastion host.</p><p></li></ol>
You may also want to configure your mail system so that mail is sent
out with a central address, instead of with the name of an individual
host, as its return address. For example, you might want mail from
your users to appear as
<em class="emphasis">person@bigcompany.example</em> and not as
<em class="emphasis">person@littlemachine.bigcompany.example</em>. Because
all of the incoming mail (replies to the above addresses in outgoing
mail) will be going to the bastion host in any case, this
doesn't remove any necessary information. It helps to guarantee
that mail will go to the bastion host correctly, even if there are
problems with the MX records for individual machines, and it gives
more consistent information to the recipients of the mail.</p><p>





If you configure your mail servers with an internal server and a
bastion host, it is important to keep internal mail from going to the
bastion host. The best way of doing this is to use a split DNS system
(described in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>). If the MX record that
directs Internet hosts to the bastion host is also visible to
internal hosts, they may attempt to deliver mail there. If this is
possible, it's a security problem (it passes potentially
confidential data through the bastion host unintentionally). If this
is not possible, it's a usability problem (mail that should be
valid bounces unexpectedly).</p><p>





Why should you separate internal and external mail servers? By
passing the incoming mail to a single internal server for processing,
the bastion host is relieved of having to keep track of internal
aliases and internal mail configuration, and you don't have to
update the mailer configuration on the bastion host nearly as often.
If the bastion host passes the incoming mail to a single internal
server or small list of internal servers, the filtering system can
restrict SMTP connections from the bastion host to just that host or
hosts, reducing the number of internal systems that can be attacked
via SMTP from the bastion host if the bastion host itself is
compromised.</p><p>





Furthermore, if the same machines handle internal and external mail
delivery, an attacker that can spoof DNS information may be able to
cause mail that was intended for internal destinations to be
delivered to an external host. Most email messages are addressed with
hostnames instead of IP addresses, and the SMTP server uses DNS to
determine the matching IP address. An attacker who can manipulate DNS
responses can redirect mail to a server under the control of the
attacker; that server can then copy the mail and return it. This will
introduce delays and will usually leave a trail in the logs or
message headers, but neither of these events will usually be
obtrusive, and you are unlikely to notice them promptly. Therefore,
you want to avoid situations where internal and external mail
delivery are handled on the machine and internal names are resolved
through DNS. The most common bad configuration is one where all
machines send mail directly; the easiest good configuration is one in
which there is an external mail server and an internal mail server,
and the external mail server has the IP address of the internal mail
server configured locally (for instance, via a hosts file).<a name="INDEX-1559" /> <a name="INDEX-1560" /> <a name="INDEX-1561" /></p><p>

<a name="ch16-7867" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.2.7. Sendmail</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1562" />
<a name="INDEX-1563" /><a name="INDEX-1564" />The mailer most
commonly used on Unix systems is Sendmail. Sendmail is very powerful,
but it also has a long and troubling history of major and minor
security problems.</p><p>





Sendmail's security problems have been widely discussed, while
the problems of other mailers have received much less attention.
However, the lack of public discussion about other mailers should not
lead you to assume these mailers are any more secure than Sendmail.
These mailers are simply not as widely used as Sendmail, and
therefore, they have fewer people  --  with both good intentions
and bad -- who are examining them for security problems.</p><p>





Sendmail is the devil that everybody knows, which is both an
advantage and a disadvantage. On the one hand, problems are going to
be found in Sendmail because that's where lots of people are
looking for them (because lots of people use Sendmail). On the other
hand, what problems are found are likely to be fixed very quickly
(again, because lots of people use Sendmail). Sendmail is very
actively supported on security issues.</p><p>





One of the reasons Sendmail has security problems is that it's
a very complex and monolithic program. It performs several different
functions, and it requires the necessary permissions to perform
<em class="emphasis">all</em> of those functions. Sendmail needs root
privileges for a number of reasons; for example, these privileges
allow Sendmail to:</p><p>





<ul><li><a name="INDEX-1565" />
<a name="INDEX-1566" />Listen on port 25 (a privileged port)
for incoming SMTP connections</p><p></li><li>Operate as a particular user to read <em class="emphasis">.forward</em>
files and <em class="emphasis">:include:</em> alias files owned by that
user, and to run programs specified by those files</p><p></li><li>Execute certain kernel system calls that (in some versions of Unix)
are restricted to programs running as root (for example, to determine
the system load in order to decide whether enough capacity is left to
process mail)</p><p></li><li>Protect files in the mail queue (i.e., messages in transit) from
snooping by unprivileged users</p><p></li></ul>
These root permissions can be a liability, though, when Sendmail acts
as an SMTP server; an attacker who manages to exploit a bug over an
SMTP connection is now talking to a process that is running as root.
The process can do essentially anything on the target machine at the
attacker's bidding. Sendmail tries to be careful to give up its
privileges whenever it doesn't really need them, but there have
still been quite a number of privilege-related bugs over the years.</p><p>





On a bastion host, it should be possible to make Sendmail run
<em class="emphasis">setuid</em> to something other than root. You can use
an alternative SMTP server (the <em class="emphasis">smap</em> package,
discussed later) for incoming SMTP connections, so that Sendmail
doesn't need to listen on port 25. You shouldn't have any
users receiving mail on the bastion host, so you shouldn't need
the ability to operate as particular users to read protected
<em class="emphasis">.forward</em> and <em class="emphasis">:include:</em>
files. There probably aren't any privileged system calls on
your system that are critical to Sendmail's operation (though
you may lose some functionality and/or need to recompile Sendmail
from source to prevent it from attempting to use those calls). All
you're left with is the need to keep ownership of files in the
mail queue consistent and to keep nonprivileged users (which the
bastion host shouldn't have anyway) from snooping on messages
in transit. Creating a user just for Sendmail and making that user
the owner of the queue directory should solve that problem.</p><p>





Each of these tasks could probably be done in more secure ways, but
this would require a major redesign and reimplementation of Sendmail,
and nobody has yet stepped up to accept this challenge: among other
reasons, out of fear that doing so would probably introduce new
problems. Instead, we keep getting patch after patch for problem
after problem, so that "the current Sendmail patch" has
become something of a running joke in the network security community.</p><p>





Sendmail has exhibited all of the types of general mailer
vulnerabilities we discussed earlier. Patching has eliminated or
reduced most of them; for example, it used to be easy to exploit
command-line bugs in Sendmail as an unprivileged user, but modern
versions strictly limit the options available to unprivileged users.
However, as with all programs of any complexity, more problems are
sure to be discovered. Also, patches for old problems have sometimes
introduced new problems.<a name="INDEX-1567" /> <a name="INDEX-1568" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.8. Other Freely Available SMTP Servers for Unix</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1569" /> <a name="INDEX-1570" />A number of other freely available
SMTP servers are available for Unix. The best-known alternative SMTP
servers for Unix are all designed to provide security, ease of
configuration, and good performance. These include
<em class="emphasis">smail</em>, Wietse Venema's Postfix, and Dan
Bernstein's <em class="emphasis">qmail</em>. All of them provide a
reasonable level of compatibility with Sendmail and offer similar
(but not identical) features in the area of forwarding, aliasing, and
mailbox delivery. All of the SMTP alternatives are arguably easier to
customize than Sendmail and also support virtual domains,
anti-relaying, and unsolicited bulk email protections. If you wish to
replace Sendmail with one of these SMTP alternatives, we strongly
recommend that you set up a trial for at least a month in order to
gain operational experience, unless you are already familiar with the
replacement. Users are fanatically unforgiving when it comes to
bounced email.</p><p>





Yet more freely available servers, designed for various purposes,
are, of course, available for Unix. Few of them are designed
specifically to provide security. You may have reasons to use servers
not mentioned here, but you should be careful to evaluate the
security that they provide.</p><p>

<em class="emphasis">smail</em><a name="INDEX-1571" />
<a href="#FOOTNOTE-59">[59]</a> was designed to be a
secure replacement for Sendmail. It was originally designed and
implemented by Ronald S. Karr and Landon Curt Noll, although it has
now been passed on to other maintainers. <em class="emphasis">smail</em>
is one of the earliest of the Sendmail replacements; it was released
in 1987.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">

</blockquote>





<em class="emphasis">smail</em> can be used as a plug-in replacement for
Sendmail as it uses many of the same command-line switches. In fact,
it has been used as the SMTP mailer for several Linux distributions.</p><p>





any of the security problems with Sendmail stem from its complexity,
and <em class="emphasis">smail</em> was designed to incorporate only the
most commonly used features of Sendmail. However,
<em class="emphasis">smail</em> is still a monolithic program and requires
the same security privileges as Sendmail. Furthermore, the addition
of new features and different maintainers has resulted in a small
number of security problems. Given the monolithic nature of
<em class="emphasis">smail</em>, we cannot recommend using this
package in a bastion host environment.<a name="INDEX-1572" /></p><p>

<a name="ch16-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.2.8.2. Postfix</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1573" />Postfix was
designed and implemented by Wietse Venema as a highly secure and
compartmentalized mailer. Rather than being a single program like
Sendmail, Postfix is broken up into separate components, each with a
specific task. The Postfix design also eliminates problems that can
arise from Unix process inheritance; once a message is accepted by
Postfix, it is processed by components that are not related to the
Unix process ancestry of the submitter. Each component performs
defensive data checking and is suspicious of all input data even if
it has been read from another component of Postfix. All programs
ought to be written in this way, but it is rarely done with enough
care. Defensive data checking significantly reduces the chances of
buffer overflow problems.</p><p>





Postfix can be installed to just send mail, to send and receive mail
alongside Sendmail, or to completely replace Sendmail. The
configuration of Postfix is quite easy. Compatibility with Sendmail
is good; it supports the use of user .<em class="emphasis">forward</em>
files and can also be configured to use a system-wide custom local
delivery agent (such as <em class="emphasis">procmail</em> ). Postfix is
supplied with simple, straightforward, and clearly written
instructions for compiling and installing Postfix and replacing
Sendmail.</p><p>





Postfix avoids most of the inherent difficulties with the design of
Sendmail. It is the exact opposite of a monolithic problem, and does
not use any <em class="emphasis">setuid</em> program. However, it does
require a world-writable directory. This could cause problems on a
multiuser system, but it can be eliminated by using a single program
that uses the group equivalent of <em class="emphasis">setuid</em>, called
<em class="emphasis">setgid</em>. If you don't want to run Sendmail
on your bastion host mail server, then we recommend using either
Postfix or <em class="emphasis">smap/smapd</em>, mentioned later in the
<a href="ch16_02.html#ch16-7921">Section 16.2.10, "Improving SMTP Security with smap and smapd"</a>

<h3 class="sect3">16.2.8.3. Qmail</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1575" />Dan Bernstein
wrote Qmail as a secure, reliable, and efficient replacement for
Sendmail on typical Internet-connected Unix hosts. Qmail, like
Postfix, is a compartmentalized mailer with separate programs for
separate tasks. Unlike Postfix, it passes some information through
process inheritance (one program starts another, which inherits
information from the first). This reduces the separation between the
programs.</p><p>





Qmail is the least Sendmail-compatible SMTP replacement, although
over time, it is becoming more compatible. As it is currently
distributed, it handles forwarding and aliasing rather differently.
In order to completely replace Sendmail and use the recommended
mailbox format, you may also need to also replace the local delivery
agent and possibly your mail user agents.</p><p>





The different parts of Qmail run as different users, in order to make
sure that each one has only the permissions it needs. Only one of
them is <em class="emphasis">setuid</em>, and it is
<em class="emphasis">setuid</em> to one of the special Qmail users, not to
root. As long as the permissions and passwords for all of the Qmail
users are correct, this is more secure than the widespread use of

there are also a number of commercial SMTP servers for Unix,

should be treated with the same skepticism you would apply to any

vulnerable until proven otherwise. For more information on evaluating
servers, see the comments on choosing security-critical programs in
<a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, "Internet Services and Firewalls"</a>. Ironically, because of the high-profile
problems with Sendmail, the developers of the commercial Sendmail
version are more security-conscious than any of the other developers
of commercial mailers.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.10. Improving SMTP Security with smap and smapd</h3>





An important step a firewall can take to improve security is to
prevent attackers from speaking SMTP directly to a full-featured
server and, instead, to use a substitute server. Fortunately, this is
feasible. SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transport
Protocol", and it really is simple. An SMTP server needs to
implement only about a half-dozen or so commands in the protocol in
order to accept incoming mail.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1580" />If you
are using Unix for handling electronic mail, you may want to consider
using the <em class="emphasis">smap</em> package that is part of TIS FWTK
as a "wrapper" for your SMTP server (particularly if you
are using Sendmail). The package includes a pair of programs called
<em class="emphasis">smap</em> and <em class="emphasis">smapd</em>.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">smap</em> is a very short, simple program intended
solely to handle incoming SMTP connections; unlike Sendmail, which
contains about 30,000 lines of code, <em class="emphasis">smap</em>
contains only about 700 lines. The relative simplicity of
<em class="emphasis">smap</em> means that, unlike Sendmail, it can be
easily be examined and considered in its entirety for security
problems. Furthermore, it's designed with least privilege and
compartmentalization in mind. The <em class="emphasis">smap</em> program
runs without root privileges. It is started by
<em class="emphasis">inetd</em>, which takes care of binding it to port 25
before starting it, so that <em class="emphasis">smap</em> doesn't
need to run as root to do that. It runs <em class="emphasis">chroot</em>ed
to a particular queue directory, and thus can't access anything
outside that directory. All it does is accept incoming messages from
the Internet via SMTP. It speaks the very minimum necessary set of
SMTP commands, and it stores each message it receives in a separate
file in the queue directory.</p><p>





The second program, <em class="emphasis">smapd</em>, comes along regularly
(typically once a minute) to process the files queued in this
directory, normally by handing them to Sendmail for delivery.</p><p>





The result of using this substitute SMTP server is that an attacker
never has a direct SMTP connection to Sendmail or any other complex
SMTP server. Such a system does not protect against data-driven
security holes, but such holes would be extremely hard for any
firewall system to guard against. Fortunately, data-driven holes in
Sendmail seem to be very rare anyway; there has only been one
instance to date.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-60">[60]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-60" />[60]This is covered in CERT Advisory
93:16. For information on obtaining CERT Advisories, see <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>.</p><p>




</blockquote>





You do give up certain capabilities by using the
<em class="emphasis">smap</em> package because <em class="emphasis">smap</em>
quite intentionally handles only the minimum possible set of SMTP
commands. In particular, <em class="emphasis">smap</em> does not support
any ESMTP features.</p><p>





A potential drawback of <em class="emphasis">smap,</em> which has been
incorporated into several commercial firewalls, is that the original
version allowed mail relaying. Although mail relaying is not
specifically a security problem, it can easily result in your
firewall's running out of resources. If you are using
<em class="emphasis">smap</em>, make sure that you have a version that
prevents mail relaying.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.11. biff</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1581" />
<a name="INDEX-1582" />Many
SMTP mail servers for Unix implement a mail notification service
called <tt class="command">biff.</tt><a href="#FOOTNOTE-61">[61]</a> If a user
has <em class="emphasis">biff</em> turned on, then every time a message
comes in, the user gets a notification that includes a message header
summary and the first few lines of the message. The notification
service uses UDP port 512 and is associated with the network daemon
called <em class="emphasis">comsat</em>. Even though it uses a UDP port,
it is not intended to be a network-available service; it normally
gets packets only from processes running on the same host. This
service should be disabled on all bastion hosts because they do not
need to provide mail notification to their users (neither the mail
nor the users should be local!). Similarly, bastion SMTP mail servers
for Unix should be configured not to send the UDP packets. Since
<em class="emphasis">biff</em> is not actually a network service,
there's no reason to try to provide it through a firewall.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-61" />[61]"Biff" is
not an acronym; it is the name of the original programmer's
dog, which used to bark at the mailman.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.12. SMTP Support in Non-SMTP Mail Systems</h3>





Several popular mail systems are not based on SMTP. Lotus Notes and
icrosoft Exchange, for instance, provide mail service, among other
things, and use proprietary protocols to talk to their native
clients. (They are discussed later in this chapter.) They also
provide SMTP handling for Internet compatibility.</p><p>





In general, non-SMTP mail systems are not particularly secure as SMTP
servers. They are large systems to start with, designed for
relatively secure environments and then improved for use on the
Internet, which makes them vulnerable. Adding SMTP support to them
merely increases the problem. In addition, their SMTP implementations
tend to be at best eccentric and more often simply incorrect in their
handling of obscure conditions, leading to various interoperability
problems. If at all possible, use a dedicated SMTP mailer to speak
and listen to the Internet (preferably Postfix, <em class="emphasis">smap,
</em>or another security-oriented server).</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.2.13. SMTP Servers for Windows NT</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1583" /> <a name="INDEX-1584" /> <a name="INDEX-1585" />The most widely used
SMTP servers for Windows NT are Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange,
which provide SMTP servers in addition to their other features.
However, a number of SMTP servers are available for Windows NT that
are designed primarily as SMTP servers. In general, dedicated SMTP
servers are both more reliable and more secure than SMTP services
added onto other mail systems. In the case of Windows NT SMTP
servers, few are actually designed for security, and fewer still with
the extensive history that Unix SMTP servers have. In general, they
are full-fledged mail server systems including POP and/or IMAP
servers, designed for maximum service rather than maximum security.</p><p>





If you have a mixed environment, you will probably want to run your
front-line SMTP server on Unix. If your environment is mostly or
entirely Windows NT-based, there can be significant advantages to
using a Windows NT-based SMTP server (aside from the normal
administrative issues). Using a Windows NT-based server allows you to
do virus checking on the SMTP server, for instance (this is possible
with Unix servers, but the virus checkers tend to lag behind the
versions that are available under Windows NT).</p><p>





Windows NT systems, like Unix systems, should be set up with a
security-conscious server as the Internet-visible server, which then
passes the mail to a full-featured server on the inside.<a name="INDEX-1586" /> <a name="INDEX-1587" /> <a name="INDEX-1588" /></p><p>
