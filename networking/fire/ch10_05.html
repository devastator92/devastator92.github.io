<h2 class="sect1">10.5. Locating Bastion Hosts on the Network</h2>





<a name="INDEX-761" /><a name="INDEX-762" />Bastion hosts should be
located on a network that does not carry confidential traffic,
preferably a special network of their own.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-763" />Most
Ethernet and token ring interfaces can operate in "promiscuous
mode". In this mode, they are able to capture
<em class="emphasis">all</em> packets on the network the interfaces are
connected to, rather than just those packets addressed to the
particular machine the interface is a part of. Other types of network
interfaces, such as FDDI, may not be able to capture all packets, but
depending on the network architecture, they can usually capture at
least some packets not specifically addressed to them.</p><p>





This capability has a useful purpose: for network analysis, testing,
and debugging, for example, by programs like Network Manager,
<em class="emphasis">etherfind,</em> and <em class="emphasis">tcpdump</em>.
Unfortunately, it can also be used by an intruder to snoop on all
traffic on a network segment. This traffic might include Telnet, FTP,
or <em class="emphasis">rlogin</em> sessions (from which logins and
passwords can be captured), confidential email, NFS accesses of
sensitive files, and so on. You need to assume the worst: bastion
hosts can be compromised. If a bastion host is compromised, you
don't want it to snoop on this traffic.</p><p>





One way to approach the problem is to not put bastion hosts on
internal networks; instead, put them on a perimeter network. As
we've discussed in earlier chapters, a perimeter network is an
additional layer of security between your internal network and the
Internet. The perimeter network is separated from the internal
network by a router or bridge. Internal traffic stays on the internal
net and is not visible on the perimeter net. All a bastion host on a
perimeter network can see are packets that are either to or from
itself, or to or from the Internet. Although this traffic might still
be somewhat sensitive, it's likely to be a lot less sensitive
than your typical internal network traffic, and there are other
places (for instance, your Internet service provider) that can
already see much of it.</p><p>





Using a perimeter net with a packet filtering router between it and
the internal network gives you some additional advantages. It further
limits your exposure, if a bastion host is compromised, by reducing
the number of hosts and services the compromised bastion host can
access.</p><p>





If you can't put bastion hosts on a perimeter network, you
might consider putting them on a network that's not susceptible
to snooping. For example, you might put them on an intelligent
10-base T hub, an Ethernet switch, or an ATM network. If this is all
you do, then you need to take additional care to make sure that
nothing trusts those bastion hosts, because no further layer of
protection is between it and the internal network. Using such a
network technology for your perimeter network is the best of both
worlds: bastion hosts are isolated from internal systems (as with a
traditional perimeter network) but can't snoop on traffic on
the perimeter network.</p><p>





Be careful about how much trust you place in the ability to prevent
hosts from snooping the network. Even with an intelligent or switched
hub, broadcast traffic will be visible to all nodes, and this traffic
may include data that is useful to an attacker. For instance,
networks that use Microsoft directory services will include a lot of
useful information about machine and filesystem names and types in
broadcast traffic. There may also be information that is sensitive in
multicast traffic, which any node can ask to receive. Finally, hubs
of this type frequently offer an administrative capability that can
control the reception of all traffic. That may be limited to a
specific port or available to all ports. You should be sure that this
is appropriately secured on any hub that bastion hosts are attached
to; otherwise, an attacker may be able to simply ask for all traffic
and get it, removing the theoretical advantages of using a hub.</p><p>





Whatever networking devices you use, you should be careful to protect
the networking devices to the same degree that you protect the
computers. Many network devices support remote administration, often
with a wide variety of interfaces (for instance, a switch may provide
a Telnet server, SNMP management, and a web management interface). An
intruder who can reconfigure networking devices can certainly keep
your network from working and may also be able to compromise other
machines. Consider disabling all remote management features (with the
possible exception of remote logging of errors) and configuring
network devices the old-fashioned way, with a terminal and a serial
cable.</p><p>
