<h2 class="sect1">21.2. Passwords</h2>





Since many authentication mechanisms depend on passwords, it's
important to understand how passwords can be compromised. There are
three ways of getting around a requirement for a fixed password:</p><p>





<ul><li>Find a way to get the system to tell you the password.</p><p></li><li>Find a way to authenticate without knowing the password.</p></li><li><p>Guess what the password is.</p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-1957" />Systems like Telnet,
where the password is passed across the network in cleartext, make it
easy for attackers to get the actual password. So do systems where
the password is stored on the computer in some way where it can be
decrypted (this is common in third-party applications for Windows
NT). Although this sort of problem is regrettably common, it's
a pretty obvious design flaw, and systems designed with any regard
for security usually manage to avoid it. Authentication that involves
a cleartext or decryptable password is unacceptably poor for most
purposes.</p><p>





Systems that pass a hashed password around, but use the same hashed
password each time, give attackers a way to authenticate without
knowing the password. They can simply grab the hashed string and use
it. This is not as convenient as knowing the actual password, since
you can't use normal client programs and you usually
don't get more than one kind of access, but it's still
quite sufficient to do damage. Authentication that uses reusable
tokens is also unacceptably poor for most purposes.</p><p>





These days, most systems avoid these pitfalls, leaving attackers to
guess what the password is. The only way to actually prevent password
guessing is to use true one-time passwords where the password is
different every time. However, it is possible to make it much more
difficult by making the passwords relatively unpredictable and by
making it hard to check the accuracy of guesses.</p><p>





The first step in making passwords unpredictable is to make certain
that there are a large number of possible passwords. This means
allowing a wide variety of different characters and as many
characters as possible. The mathematics are not intuitive to many
people, who have a habit of thinking that if you double the size of
the character set or the length of the password, you will double the
number of possible passwords. Actually, you do much better than that.
Suppose that you have a one-character password, and it can be any
lowercase letter. In that case, there are 26 possible passwords.
Adding a second character gets you 26 squared, or 676. If you allow
both upper- and lowercase, that doubles the one-character case (there
are now 52 possibilities), but it brings two characters up to 52
squared, or 2,704.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1958" />
<a name="INDEX-1959" />A
standard Unix password is 8 characters long. The size of the
character set it uses is a matter of some dispute; theoretically, any
ASCII character, including control characters, is acceptable, giving
roughly 127 characters. Most of them are difficult to type at best
and frequently impossible to get typed in rather than interpreted. In
practice, it's more reasonable to assume that the possible
characters are limited to the ones actually on a keyboard, which
leaves 84 characters. This gives roughly 2.47 * 10<sup class="superscript">15</sup> possibilities (247 trillion in the United States, 247 billion elsewhere).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-132">[132]</a> The algorithm used to
produce the strings stored in Unix password files adds two additional
"salt" characters. The "salt" makes it more
difficult (by a factor of 4,096) to create a dictionary or index that
could be used to look up the results of the algorithm to find the
password.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-132" />[132]The United States and other English-speaking countries use
different names for large numbers. Since English-speakers in general
are not able to convert the names easily and may be unaware of the
problem, we provide both.</p><p>




</blockquote>





<a name="INDEX-1960" /> <a name="INDEX-1961" />Standard
Windows NT passwords are 14 characters long, again with a possible
character set of about 84 characters. In theory, that would allow for
8.70 * 10<sup class="superscript">26</sup> possible passwords (87
septillion in the United States, and 87 quadrillion elsewhere). This
is much larger than the number of possible Unix passwords, but
Windows NT passwords are often stored and transmitted using an old
format known as <em class="emphasis">LanMan</em>, which is also the name
of many other things. The LanMan format greatly decreases the number
of possible passwords. First, LanMan is case-insensitive; it
uppercases all letters, so it uses only 68 characters. With only 68
characters, this would theoretically give 4.52 *
10<sup class="superscript">25</sup> possibilities for a 14-character
password. Second, it splits the password into two 7-character halves
and hashes them independently. This is a terrible error because it
turns the 14-character LanMan password into two independent
7-character passwords. Each 7-character password only has 6.72 * 10<sup class="superscript">12</sup> possibilities. This means that it is much easier to create a lookup
dictionary for 14-character LanMan format passwords than it is for an
8-character Unix password.<a name="INDEX-1962" /></p><p>





any people figure that splitting the password into two halves means
that there are half as many possibilities to search, but the truth is
much worse than that. In general, when a 14-character password is
hashed correctly it has a theoretical 6 trillion times (6 billion
times, outside the United States) as many possibilities as a
7-character password and is therefore this many times more difficult
to create a lookup dictionary or search. Because of the split, a
14-character password in LanMan format has only twice as many
possibilities as a 7-character password, and this is a very large
reduction in security.</p><p>





Windows NT also has a newer hash format that hashes all 14 characters
at the same time, forcing attackers to search the entire space of
possible passwords. However, if a Windows NT machine is willing to
support clients that use LanMan hashes for authentication, it will
store passwords in the older format unless they contain characters
that are illegal in LanMan passwords.</p><p>





The reason that storage formats are important is that attackers have
to check the validity of their guesses. It's impractical to try
large numbers of possibilities by trying to log into machines. It is
relatively slow to start with, and operating systems intentionally
slow down responses when multiple failed attempts are made to log in
to the same account. Furthermore, even the least attentive system
administrator is apt to notice something wrong after the first
million or so attempts. Most methods of trying to authenticate take
at least a second, and at that rate, it's over 11 days to try a
measly million possibilities. On the other hand, an attacker who has
the password in its stored form can generate the stored form for each
guess and compare them, without the delay or the risk of interacting
with the system under attack. Depending on the particular stored form
in use and the technology that the attacker is bringing to bear, it
may be as slow as hundreds of attempts per second or as fast as
millions of attempts per second. Ideally, you would like to prevent
people from getting the stored form at all, but you would also like
the stored form to be as difficult as possible to compare things
against.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1963" />It
would be possible to build a specialized Unix password cracker
similar to the machine "Deep Crack",<a href="#FOOTNOTE-133">[133]</a> which could start with a Unix password hash
and find the matching password in less than one day by brute force
(meaning that every possible password would be tried). It is also
possible to do it with a general-purpose computer, but it would take
longer. LanMan hashes are much easier to crack; modern,
general-purpose computers can brute-force them in a week. Windows NT
password hashes, on the other hand, are significantly more difficult
than Unix password hashes.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-133" />[133]<a name="INDEX-1964" />"Deep
Crack" is a machine for searching for DES keys; it was built by
the Electronic Frontier Foundation and described in the book
<em class="emphasis">Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap
Politics, and Chip Design</em>, by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
1998).</p><p>




</blockquote>





Unfortunately, all this talk about brute force password cracking,
password lengths, and encryption formats misses the important problem
with most password systems; people pick really bad passwords.
Regardless of the trillions of possible passwords that people could
be using, at most sites anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of the
passwords can be guessed using only thousands of possibilities
(common words and women's names, in general). Few people will
voluntarily use special characters or passwords of any significant
length. Most of them, left to their own devices will use something
they find highly memorable (supposing that they don't just use
"password", of course), probably their own name or the
name of somebody they love.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1965" />Automatically generated passwords
may be better, or they may be worse. Systems that generate passwords
for users also tend to work in a relatively small range (they have
to, to get things that people will remember instead of writing down),
and an attacker who knows the algorithm used will be able to search
only the possible passwords the generator could come up with.
Packages that provide an administrative account with a randomly
generated password often do even worse, choosing something
that's dependent on the machine they're installed on, or
a hexadecimal representation of some number (with only 16 possible
letters, it doesn't matter how impeccably random your data is,
there still aren't very many different passwords to search).</p><p>
