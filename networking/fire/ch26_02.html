<h2 class="sect1">26.2. Monitoring Your System</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2281" /><a name="INDEX-2282" />Another important aspect of firewall
maintenance involves monitoring your system. Monitoring is intended
to tell you several things:</p><p>





<ul><li>Has your firewall been compromised?</p><p></li><li>What kinds of attacks are being tried against your firewall?</p></li><li><p>Is your firewall in working order?</p></li><li><p>Is your firewall able to provide the service your users need?</p></li></ul>
In order to answer these questions, you'll need to know what
the normal pattern of usage is.</p><p>





<a name="ch26-21286" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">26.2.1. Special-Purpose Monitoring Devices</h3>





You'll do most of your monitoring using the tools and the
logging provided by the existing parts of your firewall, but you may
find it convenient to have some dedicated monitoring devices as well.
For example, you may want to put a monitoring station on your
perimeter net so you can be sure only the packets you expect are
going across it. You can use a general-purpose computer with network
snooping software on it, or you can use a special-purpose network
sniffer.</p><p>





How can you make certain that this monitoring machine can't be
used by an intruder? In fact, you'd prefer that an intruder not
even detect its existence. On some network hardware, you can disable
transmission in the network interface (with sufficient expertise and
a pair of wire cutters), which will make the machine impossible to
detect and extremely difficult for an intruder to use (because it
can't reply). If you have the source for your operating system,
you can always disable transmission there; however, in this case,
it's much harder to be certain you've been successful. In
most cases, you'll have to settle for extremely cautious
configuration of the machine. Treat it like a bastion host that needs
to do less and be more secure.</p><p>





In particular, you should note that Microsoft's Network Monitor
registers a special NetBIOS name when it starts up. It is a blatant
advertisement of the fact that you are monitoring the network. The
only way to stop it from happening is to unbind NetBIOS from the
network interface you're monitoring, which will also make it
impossible to use the Network Monitor Agent on it (not to mention
most other Microsoft-native network applications!).</p><p>





Other forms of network sniffing are more subtle, but also often
detectable. Most obviously, network sniffers tend to do a lot of name
service requests, in order to find hostnames for the IP addresses.
Less obviously, a machine that is accepting all packets often
slightly changes the way it handles incoming requests. A group called
The L0pht (pronounced "loft") released an
anti-sniffer-sniffer to detect network sniffers, which has led to an
arms race, with people developing less and less detectable sniffers,
not to mention an anti-sniffer-sniffer-sniffer. These technologies
are rapidly evolving; we advise that you deploy the most up-to-date,
least detectable sniffer technology available and an
anti-sniffer-sniffer on critical networks to help you find sniffers
installed by attackers. (Information about getting The L0pht's
anti-sniffer-sniffer can be found in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>.)</p><p>





Clever attackers will assume that you are intercepting packets and
will take steps to conceal traffic, whether or not they can actually
find your monitoring system. There's nothing you can do but
stay alert.</p><p>

<a name="ch26-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">26.2.2. Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>





An intrusion detection system is a piece of special-purpose software
designed to figure out if somebody has broken into your site.
Intrusion detection systems can range from relatively simple, passive
programs that read log files and look for bad things, to extremely
complex systems that use special-purpose monitoring devices spread
out across a large network, inject fake traffic into the network to
see if anybody uses the information, and/or employ sophisticated
artificial intelligence techniques to detect subtle forms of abnormal
behavior.</p><p>





Intrusion detection is a big subject, and we can't cover it
fully here. More information can be found in other places (for
instance, Stephen Northcutt's <em class="emphasis">Network Intrusion
Detection: An Analyst's Handbook</em>, New Riders, 1999).</p><p>





There are two basic techniques for intrusion detection; either
systems can know what kind of behavior is bad and set off alarms when
it happens, or they can know what kind of behavior is good and set
off alarms when anything else happens. Relatively speaking,
it's easier to recognize bad behavior than good behavior.
Unfortunately, it's more effective to recognize good behavior.</p><p>





Systems that recognize bad behavior use <em class="emphasis">attack
signatures,</em> information about what particular attacks look
like. For instance, this sort of system would recognize a port scan
as an attack because it would know that a series of attempts to
contact different ports on the same host was a sign of an attack.</p><p>





Systems that recognize good behavior use <em class="emphasis">usage
profiles,</em> information about what normally happens. For
instance, this sort of system would recognize a port scan as an
attack because it would know that normally, when somebody connects to
a port, the next thing that happens is that they use that port for
its normal purpose. In a port scan, the attacker will connect, get a
response, and immediately disconnect and try another port. This
behavior is outside of the normal pattern and therefore will be
detected as an attack.</p><p>





The difficulty with recognizing attack signatures is that the system
can detect only attacks that it knows about. When new attacks are
created, the system won't know about them until a signature is
created and added. In addition, it's often possible to disguise
signatures. For instance, the signatures for port scans used to look
for multiple connections to different ports from the same source
host, so attackers now use multiple collaborating source hosts.</p><p>





Systems that rely on usage profiles have problems with what are
called "false positives", or cases where they think an
attack is occurring but it isn't. Usage of systems changes over
time, and any profile that's specific enough to catch any
significant number of attacks will set off a large number of alarms.
Good systems now have false positive rates in the range of about 1-3
percent; unfortunately, that's 1-3 percent of the events they
look at, which in the case of a network usually means 1-3 percent of
packets. Since many sites have millions of incoming packets a day,
this apparently small error rate can still result in thousands of
false alarms a day, which is rarely acceptable.</p><p>





Intruders also have ways of hiding attacks that will defeat almost
all intrusion detection systems. For instance, a patient intruder can
scan a network very slowly; most intrusion detection systems look at
a few minutes', or maybe a few hours', worth of context
at a time. An impatient intruder can bury an attack in a large amount
of network traffic, and few systems will be able to keep up.</p><p>





Similarly, some techniques can be used that defeat almost all
attempts at hiding attacks. The most powerful and popular of these is
the <em class="emphasis">honeypot,</em> the tempting bait with nothing but
a trap behind it. For instance, if you put a machine on your
perimeter network that you don't use for any services, you know
that any attempt to connect to it is an attack. It doesn't
matter whether or not it matches an attack signature, or whether or
not it fits a normal usage pattern. It's just obviously wrong.</p><p>





How much an intrusion detection system can do for you depends mostly
on how much time, money, and development effort you can invest in the
system. Although intrusion detection is theoretically a very
effective technology, actually making it work in practice is not an
easy proposition, and it requires constant maintenance and attention.
There is no point in having an intrusion detection system unless you
have the personnel to keep it up to date and to deal with the alarms
that it produces.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">26.2.3. What Should You Watch For?</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2283" />In a perfect world, you'd like
to know absolutely everything that goes through your firewall  -- 
every packet dropped or accepted and every connection requested. In
the real world, neither the firewall nor your brain can cope with
that much information. To come up with a practical compromise,
you'll want to turn on the most verbose logging that
doesn't slow down your machines too much and doesn't fill
up your disks too fast; then, you'll want to summarize the logs
that are produced.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2284" /><a name="INDEX-2285" />You can improve the
disk space problem by keeping verbose logs offline, on some form of
removable media (for instance, tapes, writable CDs, or writable
DVDs). Tapes are cheap and hold a lot of data, but they have some
drawbacks. They're not particularly fast under the best
circumstances, and log entries are generally too short to achieve
maximum performance. They're also annoying to read data from.
If you're interested in using them, write summary logs to disk
and write everything to tape. If you find a situation where you need
more data, you can go back to the tape for it. A tape drive can
probably keep up with the packets on an average Internet connection,
but it won't keep up with an internal connection at full LAN
speeds or even with a T-1 connection to the Internet that's at
close to its maximum performance. CD and DVD writers are even slower,
but they're much easier to read data from. If you have large
amounts of disk space to use as temporary storage, they may be an
effective solution.</p><p>





No matter what you are using to write logs to, you should protect the
logs. The data that's in them may be useful to attackers, and
it may be confidential for other reasons. For instance, if you log
the contents of packets, you may well be logging encrypted sensitive
information. Even if you don't log packet contents, the
information about what packets went where may be private; it's
one thing to log the 434 times that somebody tried to go to an
embarrassing web site, and another to have it become public
knowledge.</p><p>





No matter how you're storing logs, you want to log the
following cases:</p><p>





<ul><li>All dropped or rejected packets, denied connections, and rejected
attempts</p><p></li><li>At least the time, protocol, and username for every successful
connection to or through your bastion host</p><p></li><li>All error messages from your routers, your bastion host, and any
proxying programs</p><p></li></ul>

<a name="ch26-4-fm2xml" /><blockquote class="note"><h4 class="objtitle">NOTE</h4>
For security reasons, some information should never be logged where
an intruder could possibly be able to read it. For example, although
you should log failed login attempts, you should not log the password
that was used in the failed attempt. Users frequently mistype their
own passwords, and logging these mistyped passwords would make it
easier for a computer cracker to break into a user's account.</p><p>
Some system administrators believe that the account name should also
not be logged on failed login attempts, especially when the account
typed by the user is nonexistent. The reason is that users
occasionally type their passwords when they are prompted for their
usernames. If invalid accounts are logged, it might be possible for
an attacker to use those logs to infer people's passwords.</p><p>
</blockquote>





<a name="INDEX-2286" />What are you watching for? You want to
know what your usual pattern is (and what trends there are in it),
and you want to be alerted to any exceptions to that pattern. To
recognize when things are going wrong, you have to understand what
happens when things are going right. It's important to know
what messages you get when everything is working. Most systems
produce error messages that sound peculiar and threatening even when
they're working perfectly well. For example, in the sample
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> output in <a href="ch26_02.html#ch26-65740">Example 26-1</a>,
messages 10, 14, and 17 all look vaguely threatening, but are in fact
perfectly OK.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-185">[185]</a> (Although these examples
are taken from a Unix <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>, exactly the same
phenomena can be seen in the Windows NT Event Log; information about
setting up logging can be found in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, and <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Windows NT and Windows 2000 Bastion Hosts "</a>.)</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-185" />[185]Message 10 is a common network failure
that will result in a retry, and how good do you expect your
connection to Cameroon to be? 14 is <em class="emphasis">traceroute
</em>running. 17 says there are no synonyms defined, which you
presumably already know.</p><p>




</blockquote>





If you see those messages for the first time when you're trying
to debug a problem, you're likely to leap to the conclusion
that the messages have something to do with your problem and get
thoroughly sidetracked. Even if you never do figure out what the
messages are and why they're appearing, just knowing that
certain messages appear even when things are working fine will save
you time.</p><p>

ost of your logging will probably be done via the Unix
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> facility or some other similar file-based
log mechanism. You'll need to develop log-scanning scripts to
analyze each of these log files on a regular basis. Some firewall
packages, such as TIS FWTK, come with scripts to analyze and
summarize their own logs. You could use these scripts as templates
for your own logging, or you could write your own scripts from
scratch in <em class="emphasis">awk, perl</em>, or some other suitable
language.</p><p>





As you can see, the log file is verbose and not particularly readable
(even with better linebreaks inserted). An unimportant error
condition on a distant host (the server name mismatch on
<em class="emphasis">nhs-relay.ac.cv</em>) is producing multiple error
messages (11, 12, and 13, in this highly condensed version). The log
file is also in chronological order which is not particularly the
order of importance.</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2287" />In
general, it's safer to write scripts to filter out messages to
be ignored (leaving unusual stuff), rather than writing scripts to
identify the unusual stuff directly. The reason for this is that you
seldom know all of the different messages your firewall might
produce. It's easier to ignore the benign messages than to
recognize the dangerous ones.</p><p>





Log messages fall into three categories:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Known to be</em> OK </i></dt>
<dd>For example, "login succeeded for user smith". You would
like to ignore these messages. Message 3 in <a href="ch26_02.html#ch26-65740">Example 26-1</a> is clearly in this category.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Known to be dangerous</em></i></dt>
<dd>For example, "bad disk block at location 0x47c7a8". You
would like these messages to cause some action to happen; it may be
anything from sending someone email, to submitting a trouble ticket,
to paging you.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Unknown</em></i></dt>
<dd>You would like these messages to be sent for a human to examine.
essage 18 in <a href="ch26_02.html#ch26-65740">Example 26-1</a> is an example; why is
someone sending UDP packets from port 20 to an arbitrary port above
1024? That doesn't match any common protocol.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Setting up the criteria is an iterative process; once a human has
examined a mystery message, future examples of that message can
probably be classified as either OK or dangerous without being
examined again. You'll change the rules as time goes on.</p><p>





Log entries often must be considered in context. A message
that's mildly mysterious if it occurs once is cause for serious
worry if it occurs every minute. For example, "login succeeded
for user smith" is good, unless it's preceded by three
"login failed" messages for every user above
"smith" in your password file; in that case, it's
very bad indeed. In <a href="ch26_02.html#ch26-65740">Example 26-1</a>, message 9 shows an
unexceptional outbound TCP connection, logged just on general
principles. It wouldn't be at all worrying if it weren't
preceded by messages 6 through 8. In context, you know that someone
made three failed tries at logging in as "admin", finally
succeeded, and then immediately started an outbound connection. This
looks extremely suspicious. Message 7 doesn't mean anything at
all without context.<a name="INDEX-2288" /></p><p>





In a large system, getting context may require correlating log files
from multiple hosts. This is one reason for keeping consistent time
settings; it is also a reason why people use intrusion detection
systems. If you have high volumes of traffic, a complex firewall, or
a requirement for strict security, you will probably need an
intrusion detection system to help you with the log analysis.</p><p>

<a name="ch26-21365" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">26.2.4. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h3>





Once you go beyond the obvious (for example, it's OK for users
to log in; it's not OK for the disk to be bad), how can you
tell when you're in trouble? Some rules of thumb:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Once is an accident; twice is coincidence; three times is enemy action</i></dt>
<dd>One user who tries to log in at 2 A.M. and fails is up too late and
can't type. Two users who try to log in at 2 A.M. may have been
at the same party, but you're certainly going to be curious
about the incident. Three or more attempts to log in at 2 A.M., and
someone is trying to break in. This rule of thumb applies mostly to
attempts on separate accounts; stubborn repeated attempts by the same
user to do the same thing that doesn't work probably merely
indicates that the user is single-minded  --  and wrong.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Accidents don't try to cover themselves up</i></dt>
<dd>If your log files are missing, if entries have been deleted, or if
there is any other evidence that somebody has been covering his or
her tracks, you probably have a break-in. If not, you have some other
serious problem. (Either something is broken, or somebody
administering the machine is deleting things or rotating the logs
inappropriately.)</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Most mysteries don't mean anything</i></dt>
<dd>For everybody who sets out to track down a mysterious problem or a
strange log entry and finds an intruder, there are 99 people who set
out to track down a mysterious problem or a strange log entry and
find an annoying but trivial bug. You should still try to track these
things down, but there's no need to panic.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Straightforward explanations are usually correct</i></dt>
<dd>It's possible that you were broken into at the same time you
had another known problem, but it's not likely. If you know
that you had a hardware failure, or a person wandering around doing
misguided things, you'll want to spend some time ruling out
side effects of the known problem before you decide that you also
have an intruder. On the other hand, if your files are mysteriously
disappearing and nothing is apparently wrong with your disk, somebody
is probably deleting them, and you'll want to spend a very long
time ruling out an intruder before you decide that your filesystem
code is buggy.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





You're going to end up classifying suspicious events into
several categories:</p><p>





<ul><li>You know what caused it, and it's not a security problem.</p><p></li><li>You don't know what caused it, you're probably never
going to know what caused it, but whatever it was, it's not
happening anymore.</p><p></li><li>Somebody was trying to break in but not very hard; this is a
<em class="emphasis">probe</em>.</p><p></li><li>Somebody made a serious attempt to get in; this is an
<em class="emphasis">attack</em>.</p><p></li><li>Somebody actually broke in.</p></li></ul>
The boundaries between these categories are vague. Unless
you're dealing with messages from the first category (i.e., a
known nonproblem), it's going to come down to a judgment call
most of the time. It's impossible to provide an exhaustive list
of the symptoms of any of these situations, but here are some
generalizations that may help.</p><p>





You should suspect that someone's been probing your site if you
see:</p><p>





<ul><li>A few attempts to access services at insecure ports (e.g., attempts
to contact <em class="emphasis">portmapper</em> or an X server).</p><p></li><li>Attempts to log in with common account names (e.g.,
"guest" or "lp" ; most attempts to log in as
"anonymous" are mistakes).</p><p></li><li>Requests to TFTP files or to transfer NIS maps.</p></li><li>Somebody feeding the <em class="emphasis">debug</em> command to your SMTP
server.</p><p></li><li>Packets sent to the same ports on every IP address in a range.</p></li></ul>
You should be more concerned if you see any of the following; an
attack may be going on:</p><p>





<ul><li><a name="INDEX-2289" />Multiple failed attempts to log in to
valid accounts on your machines, particularly accounts that are used
across the Internet, or attempts on accounts in the order in which
they appear in your password file.</p><p></li><li>Unusual accepted packets or commands whose purpose you don't
understand.</p><p></li><li>Packets sent to every port in a range.</p></li><li><a name="INDEX-2290" />Successful logins from an
unexpected site.</p><p></li><li>Sudden increases in incoming or outgoing traffic.</p></li></ul>
You should suspect a successful break-in if you see:</p><p>





<ul><li><a name="INDEX-2291" />Deleted or modified log files.</p><p></li><li>Programs that suddenly omit expected information (this suggests that
they have been replaced with versions that ignore the
intruder's files and programs). On Unix machines, the most
frequent victims are <em class="emphasis">login</em>,
<em class="emphasis">ls</em>, <em class="emphasis">ps</em>,
<em class="emphasis">netstat,</em> and <em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em>.</p><p></li><li>New log files containing password information or packet traces that
you can't explain.</p><p></li><li>Directories that contain more administrative entries than they
should. For example, on Unix machines, directories should contain two
entries with names made out of periods ("." and
"..", indicating "this directory" and
"parent directory"), but there should not be more than
two such entries (for instance, "..." or "..
"). If it looks as if there is more than one entry for each,
the extra entry probably has spaces in it and is being used to
conceal the file or directory from casual observation.</p><p></li><li>Unexpected logins as privileged users (for example, root) or
unexpected users who are suddenly able to become privileged users.</p><p></li><li>Services running that you have not intentionally turned on.</p></li><li>Apparent probes or attacks coming from your own machines.</p></li><li><p>Extra processes with names that are variants of common system
processes (for example, both <em class="emphasis">sendmail</em> and
<em class="emphasis">Sendmail</em> are running, or
<em class="emphasis">init</em> and <em class="emphasis">initd</em> ; this is
another trick for sneaking things in where you won't notice
them).</p><p></li><li>An unexpected change in the login behavior of your machine or for
other machines you reach from yours. This indicates that the program
you use to log in has been modified.</p><p></li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">26.2.5. Responding to Probes</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2292" /><a name="INDEX-2293" />Inevitably, you're going to
detect apparent probes of your firewall  --  packets sent to
services you don't offer to the Internet, attempts to log in to
nonexistent accounts, and so on. Probes are the Internet equivalent
of someone walking down a line of doors and checking every door knob
to see if it's locked. Probers generally try one or two things,
and if they don't get an interesting response, they move on. If
you're inclined to do so, you can spend a lot of time chasing
down such incidents, attempting to figure out where the probes are
coming from and who is behind them. However, in most situations, it
probably isn't worth the effort. The novelty of chasing down
probes of this kind fades quickly. If you're getting persistent
probes from some site, you might contact the management of that site
to let it know what's going on (in general, it has been broken
into and needs to know), but that's usually about as far as
folks need to go in responding to these probes.</p><p>





It's unfortunate that on the Internet today, probes are so
frequent that the laissez faire attitude we've described is
often an appropriate one. In good neighborhoods, people don't
get away with trying door knobs. You have a right to be unhappy with
people who behave this way and trying to get them to stop is
perfectly reasonable. However, you do need to decide where
you're going to spend your energy. Save extreme responses for
extreme situations. Treating probers with maximum harshness is just
going to convince people that you are unreasonable.</p><p>





Some people amuse themselves by setting up firewall machines to lead
on people who try common probes. For example, they put a password
file in the anonymous FTP area that appears to contain user account
data. However, if the prober breaks the encrypted passwords, he or
she sees a snide message. This is a harmless way to spend your spare
time and provides a satisfactory feeling of revenge, but it
doesn't actually improve your security much. It simply annoys
attackers, and doing so may cause them to take a personal interest in
breaking into your site.</p><p>





Some people and some firewalls prefer a more active approach to
probes, engaging in counter-attacks. A fairly wide variety of things
are sold as counter-attacks (firewall marketers find the concept
extremely sexy). They range from attempts to find out further
information about where the probes are coming from (giving you a
start on tracking them down), to automatically configuring the
firewall to reject all connections from the probing site, to actual
counter-attacks. Regardless of their often remarkably aggressive
marketing material, no commercial firewall does anything that can
reasonably be described as a counter-attack, for obvious reasons
involving liability. This is good because misidentification, loops,
and bad feelings often result from even mild automated responses.</p><p>





For instance, a forged probe purporting to be from a site that does
information-gathering when it gets probes and aimed at another such
site is almost guaranteed to suck the site administrators into a
"Yeah, but you hit me first!" argument. Why would
somebody forge such a packet? Because they did something and were
annoyed at the response they got. A little forgery can bring a lot of
community pressure to bear on somebody who has an overly vigorous
probe response. A notable example occurred with somebody whose
response to anonymous FTP attempts was to send mail threatening to
sue; a widely broadcast email contained a URL that attempted
anonymous FTP to the site, causing both resource problems and
publicity problems.</p><p>





Different sites have different opinions about what constitutes a
probe, and what constitutes a full-fledged attack. Most people call
something a probe as long as they know it's not going to work,
even if it is determined and drawn out. For example, somebody who
determinedly tries every possible combination of lowercase alphabetic
characters as your root password is not going to succeed and can
probably be ignored as a probe until you get tired of reading the log
messages. (That kind of attack won't succeed, no matter how
many combinations are tried.) However, if you have the time and the
energy, it's probably worth pursuing people who are making
determined attempts, even when you know they'll fail.<a name="INDEX-2294" /><a name="INDEX-2295" /></p><p>

presented in <a href="ch26_02.html#ch26-21365">Section 26.2.4, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"</a>, earlier
