<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>

<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p><p>

<p>The illustration on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Building Internet Firewalls</em> is
of a doorway of Gothic design, topped by a crenelated parapet. The
period of Gothic architecture is often said to have begun in the
mid-12th century, when the church of Saint-Denis was built, in Paris
in 1144. The architect of that church is unknown. Although Gothic
architecture was mainly used in the building of churches, by the late
13th century it was used for secular purposes also, including
fortifications. The structure of the merlons (the raised portions of
the parapet) in this illustration gives information about the date and
place of construction. The oblique sides of the merlons suggest that
the doorway was built in the 14th century, and the plain but sloping
top suggests that it was built in England or France. </p><p>

<p>Merlons were designed to provide defense to those inside the
fortification, while crenels (the recessed portions between the
merlons) let them shoot projectiles at attacking enemies. Given the
size of this door, and the relatively low merlons, this may have been
a postern, a doorway used by foot travellers to avoid lowering the
main gate.</p><p>
 
<p>Madeleine Newell was the production coordinator for this
book. Nancy Crumpton provided all editorial and production services
and wrote the index. Mike Sierra provided FrameMaker technical
support. Nancy Kotary and Jane Ellin provided quality control.</p><p>

<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
19th-century engraving from <em class="emphasis">Heck's Pictorial Archive of Art and
Architecture</em>. The cover layout was produced by Emma Colby with
QuarkXPress 3.3 using the ITC Garamond font.</p><p>

<p>The inside layout for this second edition was adapted by Alicia Cech and David Futato from a design created by Nancy Priest, Edie Freedman, and Jennifer Niederst, and was implemented by Mike Sierra in FrameMaker 5.5.6. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book. Chris Reilley created the figures for the first edition of this book; Robert Romano and Rhon Porter adapted those figures and created new figures for this second edition using Adobe Photoshop 5 and Macromedia Freehand 8. This colophon was written by Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary.</p><p>
