<h2 class="sect1">15.3. HTTP</h2>





HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that the web is
based on. The HTTP protocol itself is a relatively secure protocol
and a straightforward one to allow through firewalls.</p><p>





<a name="ch15-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.1. HTTP Tunneling</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1411" />
<a name="INDEX-1412" />HTTP
itself is a simple protocol, but it can carry quite complex data.
Because HTTP is simple and popular, most people let it through their
firewalls. Because it can carry complex data, it's easy to use
it to carry other protocols, which can be useful. For instance, as a
firewall maintainer, you may prefer having audio data come in over
HTTP to having to configure more open ports for audio data (your
users may not, since the quality may not be very good).</p><p>





On the other hand, <em class="emphasis">tunneling</em> can also allow
inherently insecure protocols to cross your firewall. For this
reason, it may be advantageous to use a firewall solution that does
content-based checking of HTTP connections, so that you can disallow
connections that are actually tunneling other protocols. This can be
quite difficult to do.</p><p>





Different programs use different methods of "tunneling".
These range from simply running their normal protocol on port 80, to
including support for HTTP proxying using the "CONNECT"
method (discussed later in the section about HTTP proxying), to
actually using HTTP with a data type that the client handles
specially.</p><p>





Some of these are much easier to filter out than others. For
instance, almost any content checking, whether it's an
intelligent packet filter or an HTTP-aware proxy, will get rid of
people running protocols other than HTTP on port 80. Similarly, most
HTTP proxies will let you control what destinations can be used with
CONNECT, and you should restrict them carefully to just the
destinations that you need.</p><p>





Tunneling that actually uses HTTP, on the other hand, is very
difficult to filter out successfully. In order to get rid of it, you
need to do content filtering on the HTTP stream and remove the
relevant data types. Relatively few firewalls support this
functionality, and it's very difficult to do successfully in
any case. The problem is that if you remove only the data types that
you know are being used for tunneling, you are setting up a policy
that allows connections by default, which is guaranteed to leave you
with a continuous stream of new problems. On the other hand, if you
accept only data types that you believe to be safe, you are going to
have a continuous stream of new complaints from users, because many
data types are in use on the web, and they change rapidly.</p><p>





Fortunately, the uses for tunneling that actually uses HTTP are
fairly limited. The HTTP protocol is set up to support interactions
that look like normal web browsing; the client sends a query, and the
server sends an answer. The client can't send any information
except the initial query, which is of limited size. This model works
well for tunneling some other protocols (for instance, it's
fine for tunneling RealAudio) but poorly for tunneling protocols that
need prolonged interaction between the client and the server. This
doesn't prevent people from tunneling any protocol they like
over HTTP, but it does at least make it more difficult and less
efficient.</p><p>





There is unfortunately no good solution to the general problem of
tunneled protocols. Using proxying to make sure that connections are
using HTTP, and controlling the use of CONNECT, will at least limit
your exposure. <a name="INDEX-1413" /> <a name="INDEX-1414" /></p><p>

<a name="ch15-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.2. Special HTTP Servers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1415" />
<a name="INDEX-1416" />We
have been discussing web servers, programs that exist purely to
provide content via HTTP and related protocols. But HTTP is a
straightforward and widely implemented protocol, so a number of
things speak HTTP not to provide random content, but for some
specialized purpose. The classic example is the administrative
interface to normal HTTP servers. If you're administering a web
server, you probably have a browser handy, so what's more
natural than using the browser to do the administration? For a number
of reasons, you don't want the administrative interface built
in to the standard server (among other things, common administrative
tasks involve stopping and starting the server -- stopping it
while you're talking to it is one thing, but starting it again
is a neat trick if it's not there to talk to). Therefore, there
is often a second server that speaks the HTTP protocol but
doesn't behave exactly like a normal web server reading
information out of files.</p><p>





These days, other programs and even hardware devices may provide HTTP
interfaces. For instance, you can buy a power strip with a built-in
web server, allowing you to turn its outlets on and off from a web
browser. These servers do not behave like the servers we have been
discussing, and the fact that they speak the HTTP protocol
doesn't give you any particularly good idea of what their
security vulnerabilities may be.</p><p>





You will have to assess the security of each of these servers
separately. Some of the questions you should ask are:</p><p>





<ul><li>What information can the web server read? Are there any files that it
might unexpectedly reveal?</p><p></li><li>How are users authenticated?</p></li><li>What can be done to the device via the server?</p></li></ul>
In general, you do not want to allow connections to these servers to
cross a firewall.</p><p>

<a name="ch15-91053" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.3. Packet Filtering Characteristics of HTTP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1417" />HTTP is a TCP-based service. Clients use
random ports above 1023. Most servers use port 80, but some
don't. To understand why, you need some history.</p><p>





any information access services (notably HTTP, WAIS, and Gopher)
were designed so that the servers don't
<em class="emphasis">have</em> to run on a fixed well-known port on all
machines. A standard well-known port was established for each of
these services, but the clients and servers are all capable of using
alternate ports as well. When you reference one of these servers, you
can include the port number it's running on (assuming that
it's not the standard port for that service) in addition to the
name of the machine it's running on. For example, an HTTP URL
of the form <em class="emphasis">http://host.domain.example/file.html</em> is assumed to refer to a server on the standard HTTP port (port 80); if
the server were on an alternate port (port 8000, for example), the
URL would be written <em class="emphasis">http://host.domain.example:8000/file.html</em>.</p><p>





The protocol designers had two valid reasons for designing these
services this way:</p><p>





<ul><li>Doing so allows a single machine to run multiple servers for multiple
data sets. You could, for example, run one HTTP server that's
accessible to the world with data that you wish to make available to
the public, and another that has other, nonpublic data on a different
port that's restricted (via packet filtering or the
authentication available in the HTTP server, for example).</p><p></li><li>Doing so allows users to run their own servers (which may be a
blessing or a curse, depending on your particular security policy).
Because the standard well-known ports are all in the range below 1024
that's reserved for use only by root on Unix machines,
unprivileged users can't run their servers on the standard port
numbers.</p><p></li></ul>
The ability to provide these services on nonstandard ports has its
uses, but it complicates things considerably from a packet filtering
point of view. If your users wish to access a server running on a
nonstandard port, you have several choices:</p><p>





<ul><li>You can tell the users they can't do it; this may or may not be
acceptable, depending on your environment.</p><p></li><li>You can add a special exception for that service to your packet
filtering setup. This is bad for your users because it means that
they first have to recognize the problem and then wait until
you've fixed it, and it's bad for you because
you'll constantly have to be adding exceptions to the filter
list.</p><p></li><li>You can try to convince the server's owner to move the server
to the standard port. While encouraging folks to use the standard
ports as much as possible is a good long-term solution, it's
not likely to yield immediate results.</p><p></li><li>You can use some kind of proxied version of the client. This requires
setup on your end and may restrict your choice of clients. On the
other hand, both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support
proxying, and they are by far the most popular clients.</p><p></li><li>If you can filter on the ACK bit, you can allow all outbound
connections, regardless of destination port. This opens up a wide
variety of services, including passive-mode FTP. It also is a
noticeable increase in your vulnerability.</p><p></li></ul>
The good news is that the vast majority of these servers (probably
more than 90 percent of them) use the standard port, and the more
widely used and important the server is, the more likely it is to use
the standard port. Many servers that use nonstandard ports use one of
a few easily recognizable substitutes (800 or 8000, for instance).</p><p>





Some servers also use nonstandard ports to run secondary servers.
Traditionally, HTTP proxies use port 8080, and administrative servers
use a port number one higher than the server they're
controlling (81 for administering a standard web server and 8081 for
administering a proxy server).</p><p>





Your firewall will probably prevent people on your internal network
from setting up their own servers at nonstandard ports (you're
not going to want to allow inbound connections to arbitrary ports
above 1023). You could set up such servers on a bastion host, but
wherever possible, it's kinder to other sites to leave your
servers on the standard port.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.3.4. Proxying Characteristics of HTTP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1419" />Various HTTP clients (such as Internet
Explorer and Netscape Navigator) transparently support various
proxying schemes. Some clients support SOCKS; others support
user-transparent proxying via special HTTP servers, and some support
both. (See the discussion of SOCKS and proxying in general in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>.)</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1420" />
<a name="INDEX-1421" />HTTP
proxies of various kinds are extremely common, and many incorporate
caching, which can provide significant performance advantages for
most sites. (A caching proxy is one that makes a copy of the
requested data, so that if somebody else requests the same data, the
proxy can fulfill the request with the copy instead of going back to
the original server to request the data again.) In addition, many
sites are worried about the content that people access via HTTP and
use proxies to control accessibility (for instance, to prevent access
to sites containing pornography, stock prices, or sports scores, all
of which are common nonbusiness uses of the web by employees).</p><p>





Clients that are speaking to HTTP proxy servers use HTTP, but they
use slightly different commands from the ones they'd normally
use. A client that wants to get the document known as
"http://amusinginformation.example/foodle" without using
a proxy will connect to the host
<em class="emphasis">amusinginformation.example</em> and send a command
much like "GET /foodle HTTP/1.1". In order to use an HTTP
proxy, the client will connect to the proxy instead and issue the
command as "GET http://amusinginformation.example/foodle
HTTP/1.1". The proxy will then connect to <em class="emphasis">amusinginformation.example</em> and send "GET /foodle HTTP/1.1" and return the resulting page to
the client.</p><p>





Some HTTP proxy servers support commands that normal HTTP servers
don't support. For instance, they may allow a client to issue
commands like "FTP
ftp://amusinginformation.example/foodle" (to have the proxy
server transfer the named file via FTP and return it to the client)
or "CONNECT amusinginformation.example:873" (to have the
proxy server make a TCP connection to the named port and relay
information between it and the client). There is no standard for
these additional commands, although FTP and CONNECT are two of the
most common. Most web browsers will support using an HTTP proxy
server for FTP and Gopher connections, and common web proxies (for
instance, Microsoft Proxy Server) will support FTP and Gopher.</p><p>





Some clients that are not web browsers will allow you to use an HTTP
proxy server for protocols other than HTTP, and most of them depend
on using CONNECT, which makes the HTTP proxy server into a generic
proxy. For instance, Lotus Notes and <em class="emphasis">rsync</em>
clients both are able to use HTTP proxies to get to their servers via
CONNECT.</p><p>





Using an HTTP proxy server as a generic proxy in this way is
convenient but not particularly secure. Few HTTP proxy servers
provide any interesting control or logging on the protocols used with
CONNECT. You will want to be very restrictive about what protocols
you allow this way.</p><p>





It's extremely important to prevent external users from
connecting to your HTTP proxy servers. If your HTTP proxy server can
make inbound connections, external users can use it as a platform to
attack internal servers they would not otherwise be able to get to
(this is particularly dangerous if they can use CONNECT to get to
arbitrary services). Even if the proxy server can't be used
this way, it can be used to attack third parties.</p><p>





People often search actively for open HTTP proxy servers. Some of
these people are hostile and want to use the proxy servers as attack
platforms, but some of them just want to use the proxy servers to
access web sites that would otherwise be unavailable to them because
of filtering rules at their site (or in a few cases, filtering
imposed by national governments). Either way, it's probably not
to your advantage to let them use your site. Being nice to people
behind restrictive filters is tempting, but in the long run, it will
merely use up your bandwidth and get you added to the list of
filtered sites.<a name="INDEX-1422" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.3.5. Network Address Translation Characteristics of HTTP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1423" />HTTP does not use embedded IP addresses as
a functional part of the protocol, so network address translation
will not interfere with HTTP. Web pages may contain URLs written with
IP addresses instead of hostnames, and those embedded IP addresses
will not be translated. You should therefore be careful about the
content of web pages on servers behind network address translators.</p><p>





In addition, HTTP clients may provide name and/or IP address
information to servers, leaking information about your internal
numbering and naming schemes. HTTP clients may provide
"From:" headers, telling the server the user's
email address (as the user told it to the browser), and proxies may
add "Via:" headers indicating the IP addresses of proxies
that a request (or response) has passed through.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch15-11456" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.6. Securing HTTP </h3>





You may hear discussions about secure versions of HTTP and wonder how
they relate to firewalls and the configuring of services. Such
discussions are mainly focused on the privacy issues of passing
information around via HTTP. They don't really help solve the
kinds of problems we've been discussing in previous sections.</p><p>





Two defined protocols actually provide privacy using encryption and
strong authentication for HTTP. The one that everyone knows is
usually called HTTPS and is denoted by using <em class="emphasis">https
</em>in the URL. The other, almost unknown
protocol, is called Secure HTTP and is denoted by using
<em class="emphasis">shttp</em> in the URL.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1424" /> <a name="INDEX-1425" />
<a name="INDEX-1426" />The
goal of HTTPS is to protect your communication channel when
retrieving or sending data. HTTPS currently uses TLS and SSL to
achieve this. <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>, contains more technical
information on TLS and SSL.</p><p>





The goal of Secure HTTP is to protect individual objects rather than
the communications channel. This allows, for example, individual
pages on a web server to be digitally signed -- a web client can
check the signature when the page is downloaded. If someone replaces
the page without re-signing, then the signature check will fail,
causing an alert to be displayed. Similarly, a secure form that is
submitted to a web server can be a self-contained digitally signed
object. This means that the object can be stored and used later to
prove or dispute the transaction.</p><p>





The use of Secure HTTP could have significant advantages for the
consumer in the world of electronic commerce. If a company claims
that it has a digitally signed object indicating your desire to
purchase 2,000 rubber chickens but the digital signature
doesn't match, then you can argue that you did not make the
request. If the signature does match, then it can only mean one of
two things; either you requested the chickens, or your private key
has been stolen. In contrast, when you use HTTPS, your identity is
not bound to the transaction but to the communication channel. This
means that HTTPS cannot protect you from someone switching your order
for rubber chickens to live ones, once it has been made, or just
ordering chickens on your behalf.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">15.3.6.2. Proxying characteristics of HTTPS and Secure HTTP</h3>





Because HTTPS and Secure HTTP use straightforward TCP connections,
they are quite easy to proxy. Most programs that provide HTTP
proxying also provide HTTPS and Secure HTTP proxying. However, both
HTTPS and Secure HTTP use end-to-end encryption between the client
and the server. This means that the data stream is entirely opaque to
the proxy system, which cannot do any of the filtering or caching
functions it does on normal HTTP connections.</p><p>





Proxying for HTTPS is normally done using the CONNECT primitive
(discussed earlier in the section on proxying HTTP). This allows the
real client to exchange certificate information with the server, but
it also serves as a generic proxy for any protocol running on the
ports that the proxy allows for HTTPS. Since HTTPS is encrypted, the
proxy can't do any verification on the contents of the
connection. You should be cautious about the ports that you allow for
HTTPS.</p><p>

Like HTTP, HTTPS and Secure HTTP have no embedded IP addresses and
will work without problems through a network address translation
system. Because of the end-to-end encryption, it will not be possible
to correct any IP addresses that occur in the body of secured pages,
so you should make sure that such pages use hostnames and not IP
addresses.<a name="INDEX-1427" /> <a name="INDEX-1428" /></p><p>
