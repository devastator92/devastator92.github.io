This chapter gives an overview of the issues involved in using
Internet services through a firewall, including the risks involved in
providing services and the attacks against them, ways of evaluating
implementations, and ways of analyzing services that are not detailed
in this book.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1157" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1158" /></a>The remaining chapters in <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a>
describe the major Internet services: how they work, what their
packet filtering and proxying characteristics are, what their
security implications are with respect to firewalls, and how to make
them work with a firewall. The purpose of these chapters is to give
you the information that will help you decide which services to offer
at your site and to help you configure these services so they are as
safe and as functional as possible in your firewall environment. We
occasionally mention things that are not, in fact, Internet services
but are related protocols, languages, or APIs that are often used in
the Internet context or confused with genuine Internet services.</p><p>





These chapters are intended primarily as a reference; they're
not necessarily intended to be read in depth from start to finish,
though you might learn a lot of interesting stuff by skimming this
whole part of the book.</p><p>





At this point, we assume that you are familiar with what the various
Internet services are used for, and we concentrate on explaining how
to provide those services through a firewall. For introductory
information about what particular services are used for, see <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Internet Services"</a>.</p><p>





Where we discuss the packet filtering characteristics of particular
services, we use the same abstract tabular form we used to show
filtering rules in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>. You'll need to
translate various abstractions like "internal",
"external", and so on to appropriate values for your own
configuration. See <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a> for an explanation of
how you can translate abstract rules to rules for particular products
and packages, as well as more information on packet filtering in
general.</p><p>





Where we discuss the proxy characteristics of particular services, we
rely on concepts and terminology discussed in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>.</p><p>





Throughout the chapters in <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a>, we'll show how each
service's packets flow through a firewall. The following
figures show the basic packet flow: when a service runs directly
(<a href="ch13_01.html#ch13-67137">Figure 13-1</a>) and when a proxy service is used
(<a href="ch13_01.html#ch13-81330">Figure 13-2</a>). The other figures in these chapters
show variations of these figures for individual services. If there
are no specific figures for a particular service, you can assume that
these generic figures are appropriate for that service.</p><p>

<a name="ch13-2-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
We
frequently characterize client port numbers as "a random port
number above 1023". Some protocols specify this as a
requirement, and on others, it is merely a convention (spread to
other platforms from Unix, where ports below 1024 cannot be opened by
regular users). Although it is theoretically allowable for clients to
use ports below 1024 on non-Unix platforms, it is extraordinarily
rare: rare enough that many firewalls, including ones on major public
sites that handle clients of all types, rely on this distinction and
report never having rejected a connection because of it.</p><p>

<h2 class="sect1">13.1. Attacks Against Internet Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1159" /></a><a name="INDEX-1160" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1161" /></a>As we
discuss Internet services and their configuration, certain concepts
are going to come up repeatedly. These reflect the process of
evaluating exactly what risks a given service poses. These risks can
be roughly divided into two categories -- first, attacks that
involve making allowed connections between a client and a server,
including:</p><p>





<ul><li>Command-channel attacks</p><p></li><li>Data-driven attacks<p></p></li><li><p>Third-party attacks</p></li><li><p>False authentication of clients</p></li></ul>
and second, those attacks that get around the need to make
connections, including:</p><p>





<ul><li>Hijacking</p><p></li><li>Packet sniffing<p></p></li><li><p>Data injection and modification</p></li><li><p>Replay</p></li><li><p>Denial of service</p></li></ul>
<a name="ch13-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.1. Command-Channel Attacks</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1162" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1163" /></a>A <em class="emphasis">command-channel
attack</em> is one that directly attacks a particular
service's server by sending it commands in the same way it
regularly receives them (down its command channel). There are two
basic types of command-channel attacks; attacks that exploit valid
commands to do undesirable things, and attacks that send invalid
commands and exploit server bugs in dealing with invalid input.</p><p>





If it's possible to use valid commands to do undesirable
things, that is the fault of the person who decided what commands
there should be. If it's possible to use invalid commands to do
undesirable things, that is the fault of the programmer(s) who
implemented the protocol. These are two separate issues and need to
be evaluated separately, but you are equally unsafe in either case.</p><p>





The original headline-making Internet problem, the 1988 Morris worm,
exploited two kinds of command-channel attacks. It attacked Sendmail
by using a valid debugging command that many machines had left
enabled and unsecured, and it attacked <em class="emphasis">finger</em> by
giving it an overlength command, causing a buffer overflow.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-4-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.2. Data-Driven Attacks</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1164" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1165" /></a>A data-driven attack is one that
involves the data transferred by a protocol, instead of the server
that implements it. Once again, there are two types of data-driven
attacks; attacks that involve evil data, and attacks that compromise
good data. Viruses transmitted in electronic mail messages are
data-driven attacks that involve evil data. Attacks that steal credit
card numbers in transit are data-driven attacks that compromise good
data.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-5-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.3. Third-Party Attacks</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1166" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1167" /></a>A third-party attack is one that
doesn't involve the service you're intending to support
at all but that uses the provisions you've made to support one
service in order to attack a completely different one. For instance,
if you allow inbound TCP connections to any port above 1024 in order
to support some protocol, you are opening up a large number of
opportunities for third-party attacks as people make inbound
connections to completely different servers.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-20306" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.4. False Authentication of Clients</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1168" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1169" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1170" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1171" /></a>A major risk for
inbound connections is <em class="emphasis">false authentication</em>: the
subversion of the authentication that you require of your users, so
that an attacker can successfully masquerade as one of your users.
This risk is increased by some special properties of passwords.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1172" /></a>In
most cases, if you have a secret you want to pass across the network,
you can encrypt the secret and pass it that way. That doesn't
help if the information doesn't have to be understood to be
used. For instance, encrypting passwords will not work because an
attacker who is using packet sniffing can simply intercept and resend
the encrypted password without having to decrypt it. (This is called
a <em class="emphasis">playback attack</em> because the attacker records
an interaction and plays it back later.) Therefore, dealing with
authentication across the Internet requires something more complex
than encrypting passwords. You need an authentication method where
the data that passes across the network is nonreusable, so an
attacker can't capture it and play it back.
<a name="INDEX-1173" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1174" /></a></p><p>





Simply protecting you against playback attacks is not sufficient,
either. An attacker who can find out or guess what the password is
doesn't need to use a playback attack, and systems that prevent
playbacks don't necessarily prevent password guessing. For
instance, Windows NT's challenge/response system is reasonably
secure against playback attacks, but the password actually entered by
the user is the same every time, so if a user chooses to use
"password", an attacker can easily guess what the
password is.</p><p>





Furthermore, if an attacker can convince the user that the attacker
is your server, the user will happily hand over his username and
password data, which the attacker can then use immediately or at
leisure. To prevent this, either the client needs to authenticate
itself to the server using some piece of information that's not
passed across the connection (for instance, by encrypting the
connection) or the server needs to authenticate itself to the
client.<a name="INDEX-1175" /></a>

<a name="ch13-20262" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.5. Hijacking</h3>





<em class="emphasis">Hijacking</em><a name="INDEX-1179" /></a><a name="INDEX-1180" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1181" /></a>
attacks allow an attacker to take over an open terminal or login
session from a user who has been authenticated and authorized by the
system. Hijacking attacks generally take place on a remote computer,
although it is sometimes possible to hijack a connection from a
computer on the route between the remote computer and your local
computer.</p><p>





How can you protect yourself from hijacking attacks on the remote
computer? The only way is to allow connections only from remote
computers whose security you trust; ideally, these computers should
be at least as secure as your own. You can apply this kind of
restriction by using either packet filters or modified servers.
Packet filters are easier to apply to a collection of systems, but
modified servers on individual systems allow you more flexibility.
For example, a modified FTP server might allow anonymous FTP from any
host, but authenticated FTP only from specified hosts. You
can't get this kind of control from packet filtering. Under
Unix, connection control at the host level is available from Wietse
Venema's TCP Wrapper or from wrappers in TIS FWTK (the
<em class="emphasis">netacl</em> program); these may be easier to
configure than packet filters but provide the same level of
discrimination  --  by host only.</p><p>





Hijacking by intermediate sites can be avoided using end-to-end
integrity protection. If you use end-to-end integrity protection,
intermediate sites will not be able to insert authentic packets into
the data stream (because they don't know the appropriate key
and the packets will be rejected) and therefore won't be able
to hijack sessions traversing them. The IETF IPsec standard provides
this type of protection at the IP layer under the name of
"Authentication Headers", or AH protocol (RFC 2402).
Application layer hijacking protection, along with privacy
protection, can be obtained by adding a security protocol to the
application; the most common choices for this are Transport Layer
Security (TLS) or the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), but there are also
applications that use the Generic Security Services Application
Programming Interface (GSSAPI). For remote access to Unix systems the
use of SSH can eliminate the risk of network-based session hijacking.
IPsec, TLS, SSL, and GSSAPI are discussed further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>. <em class="emphasis">ssh</em> is discussed in <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>.</p><p>





Hijacking at the remote computer is quite straightforward, and the
risk is great if people leave connections unattended. Hijacking from
intermediate sites is a fairly technical attack and is only likely if
there is some reason for people to target your site in particular.
You may decide that hijacking is an acceptable risk for your own
organization, particularly if you are able to minimize the number of
accounts that have full access and the time they spend logged in
remotely. However, you probably do not want to allow hundreds of
people to log in from anywhere on the Internet. Similarly, you do not
want to allow users to log in consistently from particular remote
sites without taking special precautions, nor do you want users to
log in to particularly secure accounts or machines from the Internet.</p><p>





The risk of hijacking can be reduced by having an idle session policy
with strict enforcement of timeouts. In addition, it's useful
to have auditing controls on remote access so that you have some hope
of noticing if a connection is hijacked.<a name="INDEX-1182" /></a><a name="INDEX-1183" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1184" /></a></p><p>

<a name="ch13-20290" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.6. Packet Sniffing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1185" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1186" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1187" /></a><a name="INDEX-1188" /></a>Attackers
may not need to hijack a connection in order to get the information
you want to keep secret. By simply watching packets pass  -- 
anywhere between the remote site and your site  --  they can see
any unencrypted information that is being transferred.
<em class="emphasis">Packet sniffing</em> programs automate this watching
of packets.</p><p>





Sniffers may go after passwords or data. Different risks are
associated with each type of attack. Protecting your passwords
against sniffing is usually easy: use one of the several mechanisms
described in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, to use nonreusable
passwords. With nonreusable passwords, it doesn't matter if the
password is captured by a sniffer; it's of no use to them
because it cannot be reused.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1189" /></a>Protecting
your data against sniffers is more difficult. The data needs to be
encrypted before it passes across the network. There are two means
you might use for this kind of encryption; encrypting files that are
going to be transferred, and encrypting communications links.</p><p>





Encrypting files is appropriate when you are using protocols that
transfer entire files (you're sending mail, using the Web, or
explicitly transferring files), when you have a safe way to enter the
information that will be used to encrypt them, and when you have a
safe way to get the recipient the information needed to decrypt them.
It's particularly useful if the file is going to cross multiple
communications links, and you can't be sure that all of them
will be secured, or if the file will spend time on hosts that you
don't trust. For instance, if you're writing confidential
mail on a laptop and using a public key encryption system, you can do
the entire encryption on the machine you control and send on the
entire encrypted file in safety, even if it will pass through
multiple mail servers and unknown communications links.</p><p>





Encrypting files won't help much if you're logging into a
machine remotely. If you type in your mail on a laptop and encrypt it
there, you're relatively safe. If you remotely log into a
server from your laptop and then type in the mail and encrypt it, an
attacker can simply watch you type it and may well be able to pick up
any secret information that's involved in the encryption
process.</p><p>





In many situations, instead of encrypting the data in advance,
it's more practical to encrypt the entire conversation. Either
you can encrypt at the IP level via a virtual private network
solution, or you can choose an encrypted protocol (for instance, SSH
for remote shell access). We discuss virtual private networks in
<a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Firewall Technologies"</a>, and we discuss the availability of
encrypted protocols as we describe each protocol in the following
chapters.</p><p>





These days, eavesdropping and encryption are both widespread. You
should require encryption on inbound services unless you have some
way to be sure that no confidential data passes across them. You may
also want to encrypt outbound connections, particularly if you have
any reason to believe that the information in them is
sensitive.<a name="INDEX-1190" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1191" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1192" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1193" /></a></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-6-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.7. Data Injection and Modification</h3>





An attacker who can't successfully take over a connection may
be able to change the data inside the connection. An attacker that
controls a router between a client and a server can intercept a
packet and modify it, instead of just reading it. In rare cases, even
an attacker that doesn't control a router can achieve this (by
sending the modified packet in such a way that it will arrive before
the original packet).</p><p>





Encrypting data won't protect you from this sort of attack. An
attacker will still be able to modify the encrypted data. The
attacker won't be able to predict what you'll get when
you decrypt the data, but it certainly won't be what you
expected. Encryption will keep an attacker from intentionally turning
an order for 200 rubber chickens into an order for 2,000 rubber
chickens, but it won't keep the attacker from turning the order
into garbage that crashes your order input system. And you
can't even be sure that the attacker won't turn the order
into something else meaningful by accident.</p><p>





Fully protecting services from modification requires some form of
message integrity protection, where the packet includes a checksum
value that is computed from the data and can't be recomputed by
an attacker. Message integrity protection is discussed further in
<a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-7-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.8. Replay</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1194" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1195" /></a>An attacker who can't take over a
connection or change a connection may still be able to do damage
simply by saving up information that has gone past and sending it
again. We've already discussed one variation of this attack,
involving passwords.</p><p>





There are two kinds of <em class="emphasis">replays</em>, ones in which
you have to be able to identify certain pieces of information (for
instance, the password attacks), and ones where you simply resend the
entire packet. Many forms of encryption will protect you from attacks
where the attacker is gathering information to replay, but they
won't help you if it's possible to just reuse a packet
without knowing what's in it.</p><p>





Replaying packets doesn't work with TCP because of the sequence
numbers, but there's no reason for it to fail with UDP-based
protocols. The only protection against it is to have a protocol that
will reject the replayed packet (for instance, by using timestamps or
embedded sequence numbers of some sort). The protocol must also do
some sort of message integrity checking to prevent an attacker from
updating the intercepted packet.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-8-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.9. Denial of Service</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1196" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1197" /></a>As we discussed in <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "Why Internet Firewalls?"</a>, a <em class="emphasis">denial of service</em> attack
is one where the attacker isn't trying to get access to
information but is just trying to keep anybody else from having
access. Denial of service attacks can take a variety of forms, and it
is impossible to prevent all of them.</p><p>





Somebody undertaking a denial of service attack is like somebody
who's determined to keep other people from accessing a
particular library book. From the attackers' point of view,
it's very desirable to have an attack that can't be
traced back and that requires a minimum of effort (in a library, they
implement this sort of effect by stealing all the copies of the book;
on a network, they use source address forgery to exploit bugs). These
attacks, however, tend to be preventable (in a library, you put in
alarm systems; in a network, you filter out forged addresses). Other
attacks require more effort and caution but are almost impossible to
prevent. If a group of people bent on censorship coordinate their
efforts, they can simply keep all the copies of a book legitimately
checked out of the library. Similarly, a distributed attack can
prevent other people from getting access to a service while using
only legitimate means to reach the service.</p><p>





Even though denial of service attacks cannot be entirely prevented,
they can be made much more difficult to implement. First, servers
should not become unavailable when invalid commands are issued.
Poorly implemented servers may crash or loop in response to hostile
input, which greatly simplifies the attacker's task. Second,
servers should limit the resources allocated to any single entity.
This includes:</p><p>





<ul><li>The number of open connections or outstanding requests</p><p></li><li>The elapsed time a connection exists or a request is being processed<p></p></li><li><p>The amount of processor time spent on a connection or request</p></li><li><p>The amount of memory allocated to a connection or request</p></li><li><p>The amount of disk space allocated to a connection or
request<a name="INDEX-1198" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1199" /></a></p><p></li></ul>
</div>
















<a name="ch13-9-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.10. Protecting Services</h3>





How well does a firewall protect against these different types of
attacks?</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Command-channel attacks</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1200" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1201" /></a>A firewall can protect against
command-channel attacks by restricting the number of machines to
which attackers can open command channels and by providing a secured
server on those machines. In some cases, it can also filter out
clearly dangerous commands (for instance, invalid commands or
commands you have decided not to allow).</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Data-driven attacks</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1202" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1203" /></a>A firewall can't do much about
data-driven attacks; the data has to be allowed through, or you
won't actually be able to do anything. In some cases,
it's possible to filter out bad data. For instance, you can run
virus scanners over email and other file transfer protocols. Your
best bet, however, is to educate users to the risks they run when
they bring files to their machine and when they send data out, and to
provide appropriate tools allowing them to protect their computers
and data. These include virus checkers and encryption software.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Third-party attacks</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1204" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1205" /></a>Third-party attacks can sometimes be
prevented by the same sort of tactics used against command-channel
attacks: limit the hosts that are accessible to ones where you know
only the desired services are available, and/or do protocol checking
to make certain that the commands you're getting are for the
service you're trying to allow.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>False authentication of clients</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1206" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1207" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1208" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1209" /></a>A
firewall cannot prevent false authentication of clients. It can,
however, limit incoming connections to ones on which you enforce the
use of nonreusable passwords.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Hijacking</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1210" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1211" /></a>A
firewall can rarely do anything about hijacking. Using a virtual
private network with encryption will prevent it; so will protocols
that use encryption with a shared secret between the client and the
server, which will keep the hijacker from being able to send valid
packets. Using TCP implementations that have highly unpredictable
sequence numbers will decrease the possibility of hijacking TCP
connections. It will not protect you from a hijacker that can see the
legitimate traffic. Even somewhat unpredictable sequence numbers will
help; hijacking attempts will create a burst of invalid packets that
may be detectable by a firewall or an intrusion detection system.
(Sequence numbers and hijacking are discussed in more detail in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>.)</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Packet sniffing</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1212" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1213" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1214" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1215" /></a>A firewall cannot do anything to
prevent packet sniffing. Virtual private networks and encrypted
protocols will not prevent packet sniffing, but they will make it
less damaging.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Data injection and modification</i></dt>
<dd>There's very little a firewall can do about data injection or
modification. A virtual private network will protect against it, as
will a protocol that has message integrity checking.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Replay</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1216" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1217" /></a>Once again, a firewall can do very
little about replay attacks. In a few cases, where there is literally
a replay of exactly the same packet, a stateful packet filter may be
able to detect the duplication; however, in many cases, it's
perfectly reasonable for that to happen. The primary protection
against replay attacks is using a protocol that's not
vulnerable to them (one that involves message integrity and includes
a timestamp, for instance).</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Denial of service</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1218" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1219" /></a>Firewalls can help prevent denial of
service attacks by filtering out forged or malformed requests before
they reach servers. In addition, they can sometimes provide
assistance by limiting the resources available to an attacker. For
instance, a firewall can limit the rate with which it sends traffic
to a server, or control the balance of allowed traffic so that a
single source cannot monopolize services.<a name="INDEX-1220" /></a></p><p></dd>
