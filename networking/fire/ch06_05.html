<h2 class="sect1">6.5. Variations on Firewall Architectures</h2>





We've shown the most common firewall architectures in <a href="ch06_01.html#ch06-57913">Figure 6-2</a> through <a href="ch06_04.html#ch06-42001">Figure 6-8</a>.
However, there is a lot of variation in architectures. There is a
good deal of flexibility in how you can configure and combine
firewall components to best suit your hardware, your budget, and your
security policy. This section describes some common variations and
their benefits and drawbacks.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2042" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.1. It's OK to Use Multiple Bastion Hosts</h3>





<a name="INDEX-434" /><a name="INDEX-435" />Although we
tend to talk about a single bastion host in this book, it may make
sense to use multiple bastion hosts in your firewall configuration,
as we show in <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2053">Figure 6-9</a>. Reasons you might want to
do this include performance, redundancy, and the need to separate
data or servers.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2053" /><div class="figure"><img height="295" alt="Figure 6-9" src="figs/fire2.0609.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-9. Architecture using two bastion hosts</h4>

You might decide to have one bastion host handle the services that
are important to your own users (such as SMTP servers, proxy servers,
and so on), while another host handles the services that you provide
to the Internet, but which your users don't care about (for
example, your public web server). In this way, performance for your
own users won't be dragged down by the activities of outside
users.</p><p>





You may have performance reasons to create multiple bastion hosts
even if you don't provide services to the Internet. Some
services, like Usenet news, are resource-intensive and easily
separated from others. It's also possible to provide multiple
bastion hosts with the same services for performance reasons, but it
can be difficult to do load balancing. Most services need to be
configured for particular servers, so creating multiple hosts for
individual services works best if you can predict usage in advance.</p><p>





How about redundancy? If your firewall configuration includes
multiple bastion hosts, you might configure them for redundancy, so
that if one fails, the services can be provided by another, but
beware that only some services support this approach. For example,
you might configure and designate multiple bastion hosts as DNS
servers for your domain (via DNS NS [Name Server] records, which
specify the name servers for a domain), or as SMTP servers (via DNS
X [Mail Exchange] records, which specify what servers will accept
mail for a given host or domain), or both. Then, if one of the
bastion hosts is unavailable or overloaded, the DNS and SMTP activity
will use the other as a fallback system.</p><p>





You might also use multiple bastion hosts to keep the data sets of
services from interfering with each other. In addition to the
performance issues discussed earlier, there may be security reasons
for this separation. For example, you might decide to provide one
HTTP server for use by your customers over the Internet, and another
for use by the general public. By providing two servers, you can
offer different data to customers, and possibly better performance,
by using a less loaded or more powerful machine.</p><p>





You could also run your HTTP server and your anonymous FTP server on
separate machines, to eliminate the possibility that one server could
be used to compromise the other. (For a discussion of how this might
be done, see the description of HTTP server vulnerabilities in <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "The World Wide Web"</a>.)<a name="INDEX-436" /><a name="INDEX-437" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2076" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.2. It's OK to Merge the Interior Router and the Exterior Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-438" /><a name="INDEX-439" /><a name="INDEX-440" /><a name="INDEX-441" />You can
merge the interior and exterior routers into a single router, but
only if you have a router sufficiently capable and flexible. In
general, you need a router that allows you to specify both inbound
and outbound filters on each interface. In <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>, we discuss what this means, and we describe
the packet filtering problems that may arise with routers that have
more than two interfaces and don't have this capability.</p><p>





If you merge the interior and exterior routers, as we show in <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2094">Figure 6-10</a>, you'll still have a perimeter net (on
one interface of the router) and a connection to your internal net
(on another interface of the router). Some traffic would flow
directly between the internal net and the Internet (the traffic that
is permitted by the packet filtering rules set up for the router),
and other traffic would flow between the perimeter net and the
Internet, or the perimeter net and the internal net (the traffic that
is handled by proxies).</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2094" /><div class="figure"><img height="295" alt="Figure 6-10" src="figs/fire2.0610.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-10. Architecture using a merged interior and exterior router</h4>

This architecture, like the screened host architecture, creates a
single point of failure. Since now only one router is between the
inside and the outside, if that router is compromised, the entire
site is compromised. In general, routers are easier to protect than
hosts, but they are not impenetrable.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2098" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.3. It's OK to Merge the Bastion Host and the Exterior Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-442" /><a name="INDEX-443" />There might be
cases in which you use a single dual-homed machine as both your
bastion host and your exterior router. Here's an example:
suppose you only have a dial-up SLIP or PPP connection to the
Internet. In this case, you might run PPP on your bastion host, and
let it act as both bastion host and exterior router. This is
functionally equivalent to the three-machine configuration (bastion
host, interior router, exterior router) described for the screened
subnet architecture shown earlier in this chapter.</p><p>





Using a dual-homed host to route traffic won't give you the
performance or the flexibility of a dedicated router, but you
don't need much of either for a single low-bandwidth
connection. Depending on the operating system and software
you're using, you may or may not have the ability to do packet
filtering. Several of the available interface software packages have
quite good packet filtering capabilities. However, because the
exterior router doesn't have to do much packet filtering
anyway, using an interface package that doesn't have good
packet filtering capabilities is not that big a problem.</p><p>





Unlike merging the interior and exterior routers, merging the bastion
host with the exterior router, as shown in <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2115">Figure 6-11</a>, does not open significant new vulnerabilities.
It does expose the bastion host further. In this architecture, the
bastion host is more exposed to the Internet, protected only by
whatever filtering (if any) its own interface package does, and you
will need to take extra care to protect it.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2115" /><div class="figure"><img height="317" alt="Figure 6-11" src="figs/fire2.0611.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-11. Architecture using a merged bastion host and exterior router</h4>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2118" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.4. It's Dangerous to Merge the Bastion Host and the Interior Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-444" /><a name="INDEX-445" />While it is
often acceptable to merge the bastion host and the exterior router,
as we discussed in the previous section, it's not a good idea
to merge the bastion host and the interior router, as we show in
<a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2130">Figure 6-12</a>. Doing so compromises your overall
security.</p><p>





The bastion host and the exterior router each perform distinct
protective tasks; they complement each other but don't back
each other up. The interior router functions in part as a backup to
the two of them.</p><p>





If you merge the bastion host and the interior router, you've
changed the firewall configuration in a fundamental way. In the first
case (with a separate bastion host and interior router), you have a
screened subnet firewall architecture. With this type of
configuration, the perimeter net for the bastion host doesn't
carry any strictly internal traffic, so this traffic is protected
from snooping even if the bastion host is successfully penetrated; to
get at the internal network, the attacker still must get past the
interior router. In the second case (with a merged bastion host and
interior router), you have a screened host firewall architecture.
With this type of configuration, if the bastion host is broken into,
there's nothing left in the way of security between the bastion
host and the internal network.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2130" /><div class="figure"><img height="307" alt="Figure 6-12" src="figs/fire2.0612.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-12. Architecture using a merged bastion host and interior router</h4>

One of the main purposes of the perimeter network is to prevent the
bastion host from being able to snoop on internal traffic. Moving the
bastion host to the interior router makes all of your internal
traffic visible to it.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2134" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.5. It's Dangerous to Use Multiple Interior Routers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-446" />Using
multiple interior routers to connect your perimeter net to multiple
parts of your internal net can cause a lot of problems and is
generally a bad idea.</p><p>





The basic problem is that the routing software on an internal system
could decide that the fastest way to another internal system is via
the perimeter net. If you're lucky, this approach simply
won't work because it will be blocked by the packet filtering
on one of the routers. If you're unlucky, it will work, and
you'll have sensitive, strictly internal traffic flowing across
your perimeter net, where it can be snooped on if somebody has
managed to break in to the bastion host.</p><p>





It's also difficult to keep multiple interior routers correctly
configured. The interior router is the one with the most important
and the most complex set of packet filters, and having two of them
doubles your chances of getting the rule sets wrong.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-447" />Nevertheless, you may still end up
wanting to do this. <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2156">Figure 6-13</a> shows the basic
architecture using multiple interior routers. On a large internal
network, having a single interior router may be both a performance
problem and a reliability problem. If you're trying to provide
redundancy, that single point of failure is a major annoyance. In
that case, the safest (and most redundant) thing to do is to set up
each interior router to a separate perimeter net and exterior router;
this configuration is discussed earlier in this chapter. This
configuration is more complex and more expensive, but it increases
both redundancy and performance, as well as making it highly unlikely
that traffic will try to go between the interior routers (if the
Internet is the shortest route between two parts of your internal
network, you have much worse problems than most sites) and
extraordinarily unlikely that it will succeed (four sets of packet
filters are trying to keep it out).</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2156" /><div class="figure"><img height="320" alt="Figure 6-13" src="figs/fire2.0613.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-13. Architecture using multiple interior routers</h4>

If performance problems alone are motivating you to look at multiple
interior routers, it's hard to justify the expense of separate
perimeter networks and exterior routers. In most cases, however, the
interior router is not the performance bottleneck. If it is, then one
of the following cases is occurring:</p><p>





<ul><li>A lot of traffic going to the perimeter net is not then going to the
external network.</p><p></li><li>Your exterior router is much faster than your interior router.</p></li></ul>
In the first case, you have probably misconfigured something; the
perimeter net may take occasional traffic that isn't destined
for the external world in some configurations (for example, DNS
queries about external hosts when the information is cached), but
that traffic should never be significant. In the second case, you
should seriously consider upgrading the interior router to match the
exterior router, instead of adding a second one.</p><p>





Another reason for having multiple interior routers is that you have
multiple internal networks, which have technical, organizational, or
political reasons not to share a single router. The simplest way to
accommodate these networks would be to give them separate interfaces
on a single router, as shown in <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2163">Figure 6-14</a>. This
complicates the router configuration considerably (how considerably
depends a great deal on the router in question, as discussed in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>) but doesn't produce the risks of a
multiple interior router configuration. If there are too many
networks for a single router, or if sharing a router is unpalatable
for other reasons, consider making an internal backbone and
connecting it to the perimeter network with a single router, as shown
in <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2166">Figure 6-15</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2163" /><div class="figure"><img height="295" alt="Figure 6-14" src="figs/fire2.0614.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-14. Multiple internal networks (separate interfaces in a single router)</h4>

<a name="ch06-2166" /><div class="figure"><img height="343" alt="Figure 6-15" src="figs/fire2.0615.gif" width="481" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-15. Multiple internal networks (backbone architecture)</h4>

You may find that an effective way to accommodate different security
policies among different internal networks is to attach them to the
perimeter through separate routers (e.g., one network wants to allow
connections that others consider insecure). In this case, the
perimeter network should be the <em class="emphasis">only</em>
interconnection between the internal networks; there should be no
confidential traffic passing between them; and each internal network
should treat the other as an untrusted, external network. This is
likely to be extremely inconvenient for some users on each network,
but anything else will either compromise the security of the site as
a whole or remove the distinction that caused you to set up the two
routers in the first place.</p><p>





If you decide that you are willing to accept the risks of having
multiple interior routers, you can minimize those risks by having all
the interior routers managed by the same group (so conflicting
security policies aren't being enforced). You should also keep
a careful watch for internal traffic crossing the perimeter network
and act promptly to cure the sources of it.<a name="INDEX-448" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-2173" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.6. It's OK to Use Multiple Exterior Routers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-449" /><a name="INDEX-450" /><a name="INDEX-451" />In some cases, it makes sense to
connect multiple exterior routers to the same perimeter net, as we
show in <a href="ch06_05.html#ch06-2187">Figure 6-16</a>. Examples are:</p><p>





<ul><li>You have multiple connections to the Internet (for example, through
different service providers, for redundancy).</p><p></li><li>You have a connection to the Internet plus other connections to other
sites.</p><p></li></ul>
In these cases, you might instead have one exterior router with
multiple exterior network interfaces.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2187" /><div class="figure"><img height="299" alt="Figure 6-16" src="figs/fire2.0616.gif" width="478" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-16. Architecture using multiple exterior routers</h4>

Attaching multiple exterior routers that go to the same external
network (e.g., two different Internet providers) is not a significant
security problem. They may have different filter sets, but
that's not critical in exterior routers. There is twice the
chance that one will be compromisable, but a compromise of an
exterior router usually is not particularly threatening.</p><p>





Things are more complex if the connections are to different places
(for example, one is to the Internet and one is to a site
you're collaborating with and need more bandwidth to). To
figure out whether such an architecture makes sense in these cases,
ask yourself this question: what traffic could someone see if they
broke into a bastion host on this perimeter net? For example, if an
attacker broke in, could he snoop on sensitive traffic between your
site and a subsidiary or affiliate? If so, then you may want to think
about installing multiple perimeter nets instead of multiple exterior
routers on a single perimeter net. (This case is shown in the next
section.)</p><p>





Other significant problems are involved in setting up connections to
external networks with which you have special relationships, which
are discussed later in this chapter, in <a href="ch06_07.html#ch06-2231">Section 6.7, "Internal Firewalls"</a>.<a name="INDEX-452" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.7. It's Dangerous to Use Both Screened Subnets and Screened Hosts</h3>





<a name="INDEX-453" />
<a name="INDEX-454" />If you have a
screened subnet, you should not allow connections from the Internet
directly onto your internal networks. This may seem intuitively
obvious (what's the point in having a screened subnet if
you're not going to use it?), but you'd be surprised how
many people end up making exceptions. These sorts of exceptions are
extremely dangerous. Once you have a screened subnet, you're
going to be concentrating your protections there, and it's
almost impossible to properly protect both a screened subnet and a
screened host on an internal network.</p><p>





There are two common situations in which people ask for exceptions.
First, people providing services to Internet users find that the
interior router interferes with either administration of the services
or communication between components (for instance, a web server that
needs to talk to an internal database server). Second, people with
tools for accessing new protocols (proxy servers for the latest
multimedia 3D all-singing all-dancing tool, for instance) don't
want to go to the trouble of putting them in somebody else's
carefully protected space and are completely convinced that
they're so safe you can just let traffic through to them.</p><p>





<a href="ch23_01.html">Chapter 23, "Databases and Games"</a>, discusses the positioning of web
servers and their associated components in detail, but the short
summary is that putting the web server itself on the internal network
is extremely risky, even if you are sure that only web traffic can
get to it. If you are having problems allowing administrative
protocols through, <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, and <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Windows NT and Windows 2000 Bastion Hosts "</a>, discuss methods for safely administering
bastion hosts.</p><p>





As for the theoretically safe brand-new protocols, there's a
lot to consider before you hand over control of an experimental
bastion host. Make sure that:</p><p>





<ul><li>No other bastion hosts trust the experimental one.</p><p></li><li>The experimental bastion host cannot snoop on important network
traffic.</p><p></li><li>The machine starts out in a secure configuration.</p></li><li>You will be able to detect break-ins on the experimental bastion host.</p></li></ul>
Then hand it over and let people play with it. It's better for
them to experiment in a controlled way where you can keep an eye on
them than to succeed in working around the firewall altogether. If
you have the resources, you may want to put a separate screened
subnet in place just for experimentation.</p><p>
