<h2 class="sect1">2.5. Remote Access</h2>





There are many situations in which you would like to run a program on
a computer other than the one that you're in front of. For
instance, you may be in front of a slow computer because you're
travelling with a laptop, or your other computer is a supercomputer,
or you're using "thin clients" -- purposefully
stupid computers -- in order to lower maintenance costs and get
economies of scale. Originally, remote access meant some form of
remote terminal access, which allows you to use character-based
applications. These days, character-only access is rarely sufficient.
Instead, you may need some form of remote graphics.</p><p>





The general questions about remote access are the same for all
methods:</p><p>





<ul><li>Are there appropriate controls on who can access the machine
remotely? How are remote users authenticated?</p><p></li><li>Can anybody take over a connection that's in progress?</p></li><li>Can eavesdroppers pick up important information (particularly,
authentication information)?</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="ch02-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.5.1. Remote Terminal Access and Command Execution</h3>





<a name="INDEX-164" /><a name="INDEX-165" /><a name="INDEX-166" />Originally,
programs that provided remote terminal access allowed you to use a
remote system as if your computer were a directly attached
terminal -- an old-fashioned terminal, capable of displaying and
generating text. These days, there are computers that support remote
terminal access without supporting genuine physical terminals, and
there are many computers that can't do much with a text-only
interface no matter how it's attached to them.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-167" />Telnet is the
standard for remote terminal access on the Internet. Telnet allows
you to provide remote text access for your users from any
Internet-connected site without making special arrangements.</p><p>





Telnet was once considered a fairly secure service because it
requires users to authenticate themselves. Unfortunately, Telnet
sends all of its information unencrypted, which makes it extremely
vulnerable to sniffing and hijacking attacks. For this reason, Telnet
is now considered one of the most dangerous services when used to
access your site from remote systems. (Accessing remote systems from
your site is <em class="emphasis">their</em> security problem, not yours.)
Telnet is safe only if the remote machine and all networks between it
and the local machine are safe. This means that Telnet is not safe
across the Internet, where you can't reliably identify the
intervening networks, much less trust them.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-168" />There are various
kinds of authentication schemes for doing remote logins, which will
automatically work with Telnet (in particular, see the discussion of
one-time passwords in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>). Unfortunately,
even if you protect your password, you may still find that your
session can be tapped or hijacked; preventing it requires using an
encrypted protocol.</p><p>





There are two popular ways of doing this. First, you can simply
replace Telnet with an encrypted remote terminal access program; the
widely accepted Internet standard is the secure shell (SSH), which
provides a variety of encrypted remote access services, but a number
of other solutions are available. Second, you can create an encrypted
network connection (a virtual private network, or VPN) and run normal
Telnet across that. See <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Firewall Technologies"</a>, for a discussion
of VPN techniques.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-169" /><a name="INDEX-170" /><a name="INDEX-171" />Other programs besides Telnet and SSH
can be used for remote terminal access and remote execution of
programs  --  most notably <em class="emphasis">rlogin</em>,
<em class="emphasis">rsh</em>, and <em class="emphasis">on</em>. These programs
are used in a trusted environment to allow users remote access
without having to reauthenticate themselves. The host they're
connecting to trusts the host they're coming from to have
correctly authenticated the user. The trusted host model is simply
inappropriate for use across the Internet because you generally
cannot trust hosts outside your network. In fact, you can't
even be sure the packets are coming from the host they say they are.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">rlogin</em> and <em class="emphasis">rsh</em> may be
appropriate for use within a network protected by a firewall,
depending on your internal security policies.
<em class="emphasis">on</em>, however, places all of its security checks
in the client program, and anyone can use a modified client that
bypasses these checks, so <em class="emphasis">on</em> is completely
insecure for use even within a local area network protected by a
firewall (it lets any user run any command as any other user). You
disable <em class="emphasis">on</em> by disabling the
<em class="emphasis">rexd</em> server, as we'll describe in <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>. Fortunately, <em class="emphasis">on</em> is
relatively rare these days; Windows NT, which provides
<em class="emphasis">rlogin</em> and <em class="emphasis">rsh</em> clients,
does not provide an <em class="emphasis">on</em> client.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.5.2. Remote Graphic Interfaces for Microsoft Operating Systems</h3>





Although Windows NT provides clients for most of the remote execution
services described previously, and servers for many of them are
available as part of the resource kits or third-party products,
remote terminal services in general aren't very interesting on
Windows NT. While there are character-oriented programs that will
allow you to do many administrative tasks, most of the programs
people want to use are graphical.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-172" /> <a name="INDEX-173" /> <a name="INDEX-174" />Microsoft provides remote
graphical interfaces as part of Windows 2000 servers, in a package
called Terminal Services. This is also available for Windows NT 4 as
a special Terminal Server edition of the operating system. Terminal
Services and Terminal Server both use a Microsoft-developed protocol
called Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to communicate between clients
and servers.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-175" />
<a name="INDEX-176" />A variety of other proprietary
protocols are used for remote graphical interfaces to Windows, of
which the most capable and widespread is Independent Computing
Architecture (ICA) developed by Citrix. ICA has been licensed by a
number of vendors, and a wide variety of clients and servers that use
it are available, including multi-user Windows NT servers and
Java-based clients that can run on any machine with a Java-enabled
web browser. ICA plug-ins are available for Terminal Services and
Terminal Server.</p><p>





TCP/IP-based remote access is also available from almost every other
remote access program in the Windows market, including LapLink,
RemotelyPossible, and PcANYWHERE, to name only a few. There is also
the controversial program BO2K, which is a freely available open
source program that provides remote access. It is controversial
because it is widely distributed as a tool for intruders, designed to
provide remote access to outsiders; on the other hand, it is a
full-featured and effective tool to provide legitimate remote access
as well.<a name="INDEX-177" /></p><p>





These programs differ widely in their security implications, although
most of them are unfortunately insecure. For a full discussion of the
issues and approaches, see <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>.</p><p>

<a name="ch02-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.5.3. Network Window Systems</h3>





<a name="INDEX-178" /><a name="INDEX-179" /><a name="INDEX-180" />Most Unix machines currently provide
window systems based on the X11 window system. X11 servers are also
available as third-party applications for almost every other
operating system, including all versions of Microsoft Windows and
many versions of MacOS. X11 clients are rarer but are available for
Windows NT. Network access is an important feature of X11. As more
and more programs have graphical user interfaces, remote terminal
access becomes less and less useful; you need graphics, not just
text. X11 gives you remote graphics.</p><p>





X11 servers are tempting targets for intruders. An intruder with
access to an X11 server may be able to do any of the following types
of damage:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Get screen dumps</i></dt>
<dd>These are copies of whatever is shown on the users' screens.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Read keystrokes</i></dt>
<dd>These may include users' passwords.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Inject keystrokes</i></dt>
<dd>They'll look just as if they were typed by the user. Imagine
how dangerous this could be in a window in which a user is running a
root shell.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<a name="INDEX-181" /><a name="INDEX-182" />Originally,
X11 primarily used authentication based on the address that
connections came from, which is extremely weak and not suitable for
use across the Internet. These days, most X11 servers implement more
secure authentication mechanisms. However, just like Telnet, X11 is
still vulnerable to hijacking and sniffing, even when the
authentication is relatively secure, and solving the overall security
problem requires that you encrypt the entire connection via SSH or a
VPN solution.</p><p>
