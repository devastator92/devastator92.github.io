<h2 class="sect1">22.2. Routing Protocols</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2045" /> <a name="INDEX-2046" />
<a name="INDEX-2047" />Routing
protocols are used to distribute information about where packets
should be directed. Any given device can pass a packet only to
another device on the same local area network. If the packet's
destination is on a different local area network, the device must
know what machine can move it to the next network, on the way to its
destination. Most desktop machines have very little use for routing
protocols -- usually, a desktop machine has a single network
interface and attaches to a network with only one cross-connection to
other networks. Thus, a desktop machine needs to know only "If
the packet isn't bound for a machine on this network, hand it
to that address over there". However, bastion hosts and
Internet-connected gateways may be keeping track of much more complex
situations, involving multiple network interfaces, and multiple
connections from those networks to others.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2048" />Routing protocols in general
are dangerous. Attackers who can send you bad routing information not
only have an easy way of performing a denial of service attack (if
you route your packets the wrong places, you can't talk to
anybody), but also have a much easier time of intercepting data (they
can get you to send data to them so they can read it on the way
past). Furthermore, routing protocols tend to be old. Many of the
routing protocols in use today were designed when the Internet was a
kinder, gentler, and smaller place, and the idea that people might
intentionally lie to you about routes had never occurred to anybody,
so there is no provision for preventing it.</p><p>





It's actually quite difficult to design a routing protocol
that's secure and is still usable for routing on the Internet
backbone, since the protocol needs to move quite large amounts of
data, including frequent changes, between hosts that are already
busy. Because the backbone routers are specialized devices, not
general-purpose computers, and because routing problems on the
backbone can cause widespread disruption, changes to backbone routing
protocols have to be made very slowly and carefully.</p><p>





Fortunately, the routing protocols currently used on the backbone are
different from the protocols used within individual sites. We do not
discuss protocols that are used between distinct entities across the
backbone because these protocols do not usually cross firewalls.
Instead, we discuss the protocols most commonly used for routing
within networks (often called <em class="emphasis">interior gateway
protocols</em>), which you may need to use across internal
firewalls.</p><p>





<a name="ch22-15098" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">22.2.1. Routing Information Protocol (RIP)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2049" />RIP is the oldest
routing protocol on the Internet. In fact, it predates IP; it was
taken almost verbatim from the older Xerox Network Services (XNS)
system. It is also still a very commonly used routing protocol on
local area IP networks. Routers (including general-purpose machines
with multiple interfaces that can act as routers) use RIP to
periodically broadcast which networks they know how to reach and how
far away those networks are. By listening to these broadcasts, a
router or host can determine what networks are reachable and choose
the best (shortest) path to each. RIP servers generally just
broadcast this information every 30 seconds or so for anyone
interested to hear, but a RIP client can request a special update
from a RIP server, which will cause the server to reply directly to
the client with the information requested.</p><p>





By default, RIP is completely insecure; clients simply accept any
data they are sent. RIP does not provide any place in the protocol
for authentication. There have been security problems with RIP
clients because it is possible for RIP packets to contain not only
routing information, but also the request to turn on logging to a
specified file. Some Unix RIP clients were willing to accept such
requests; since routing daemons have to run as root, they were then
willing and able to overwrite any file on the system with a log of
routing updates, which is not a useful substitute for most system
files. RIP clients are no longer routinely configured to accept such
requests.</p><p>





any RIP implementations will allow you to configure a RIP client
with slight security improvements; for instance, they will allow you
to specify that you are willing to accept RIP updates only from
certain IP source addresses, and/or they will allow you to declare
that certain routing information cannot be modified by RIP updates.
This is usually sufficient to protect clients from local
misconfigurations but not sufficient to protect against active
hostile acts.</p><p>





A modified version of RIP, called RIP-2, provides several
improvements to the routing information that's distributed and
also allows for the use of passwords. Unfortunately, the normal
method of using passwords is to put the same 16-character password in
every packet. Again, this is sufficient to protect clients from local
misconfigurations (you're unlikely to get the right password by
accident) but not against hostile acts (any attacker can read the
password out of any valid RIP broadcast and use it). It is easier to
maintain than a list of valid IP source addresses. RIP-2
implementations that support MD5 authentication are becoming more
widely available, and this authentication actually provides a
reasonable amount of protection.</p><p>





RIP-2 and RIP implementations can interoperate, but RIP
implementations won't verify or attach the password. As a
result, if you're using RIP-2 with passwords, routers that
implement RIP can receive routing updates but cannot successfully
send them.</p><p>





<a name="ch22-15124" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.2.1.1. Packet filtering characteristics of RIP</h3>





RIP is a UDP-based service. RIP servers listen on port 520 for
broadcasts from other servers and requests from clients. RIP servers
generally send their broadcasts from port 520. RIP clients generally
use ports above 1023.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.2. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2051" /> <a name="INDEX-2052" />OSPF is a more recent protocol
than RIP that uses a completely different approach to distributing
routing information. The main difference between the two protocols
involves the kinds of routing information they distribute, but there
are also significant differences in the ways they use the network.
RIP is based on UDP, while OSPF is based directly on IP; RIP uses
unicast and broadcast, while OSPF uses unicast and multicast.</p><p>





OSPF supports authentication, which could theoretically be quite
secure -- the protocol allows for cryptographic message digests.
However, the cryptographic message digest algorithm is not specified
by the standard, so in practice OSPF authentication is restricted to
eight-character cleartext passwords or the same degree of
authentication as RIP-2. This will protect from accidental
misconfigurations but not from hostile attacks.</p><p>





<a name="ch22-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.2.2.1. Packet filtering characteristics of OSPF</h3>





OSPF is layered directly on IP, not on TCP or UDP, and is IP protocol
89. OSPF uses both multicast and unicast packets. OSPF uses two
special multicast groups, AllSPFRouters (224.0.0.5) and AllDRouters
(224.0.0.6). OSPF does not have port numbers but does distinguish
between different messages with a packet type identifier.</p><p>

OSPF multicast packets are not intended to be forwarded and will be
sent with a TTL of 1, which means that the packets will not go
through a router. If you are doing packet filtering that is not
completely transparent, and for some reason you still want to do OSPF
through the packet filter, you have two choices. The preferred option
is to preconfigure the routers that need to pass routing updates
through the packet filter so that they know about their neighbors.
This will usually remove the need to pass multicast packets. If that
is unacceptable, and the packet filter is sufficiently flexible, you
may be able to configure the packet filter so that it does not
decrease the TTL on OSPF packets and will pass them on. This is an
extremely eccentric network configuration and is rarely advisable;
any packet filter capable of this sort of trickery is probably on a
machine capable of simply speaking OSPF directly, which would be
preferable.<a name="INDEX-2053" /> <a name="INDEX-2054" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.3. Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2055" /> <a name="INDEX-2056" />IGMP is used to
manage multicast groups. See <a href="ch19_01.html">Chapter 19, "Real-Time Conferencing Services"</a>, for more
information about multicast. Multicasting is also increasingly being
used by administrative protocols; for example, it's used for
WINS server replication.</p><p>





ulticast routers do not forward all multicast packets to all
networks; they forward multicast packets only to places where hosts
are listening for them. In order to make this decision, a multicast
router has to keep track of the multicast groups in use. Since
multicast packets go to all the hosts on a network segment that want
them, the router doesn't need to identify all the hosts that
are in a group, but it does need to know, for each network segment,
what groups are of interest. IGMP is the protocol that hosts and
routers use to communicate this information.</p><p>





ulticast routers receive all multicast packets, regardless of the
multicast address they are sent to. Hosts that use multicast receive
packets only for groups they subscribe to, but all of them subscribe
to a group called AllSystems (224.0.0.1). All IGMP packets are sent
out with a TTL of 1, which means that they will not be forwarded
through a router. This makes sense because the purpose of IGMP is to
configure a router's information about a particular, directly
attached network segment.</p><p>





There are two parts to the IGMP process: first, hosts send out
notifications, called <em class="emphasis">membership reports</em>, when
they join any group other than AllSystems (and in some versions, when
they leave those groups as well). Second, routers can send out
periodic queries asking about group membership. A router can ask for
information either about all groups, or about a particular group. In
either case, hosts respond with membership reports, just like the
ones they send when they initially join groups. The protocol is
designed so that only one host per group will respond. All the router
needs to know is whether or not there is interest in the group; it
doesn't need to know how many hosts are interested.</p><p>





<a name="ch22-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.2.3.1. Packet filtering characteristics of IGMP</h3>





IGMP is based directly on IP and is protocol 2. IGMP does not have
port numbers; IGMP packets are distinguished by packet types. IGMP is
a datagram protocol that does not have an ACK bit or its equivalent.
All IGMP packets are sent with a TTL of 1 and will not pass through a
packet filter unless it is completely transparent or is specially
configured to pass IGMP without decreasing the TTL. You would pass
IGMP through a packet filter only if the packet filter was between a
multicast router and the hosts it serves, and the packet filter was
also going to pass all other multicast. In this situation, it would
probably be better to either tunnel multicast or configure the packet
filter to be a multicast router.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.4. Router Discovery/ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2059" /> <a name="INDEX-2060" /> <a name="INDEX-2061" />Router discovery, also known as ICMP
Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP), is not actually a routing protocol.
It is a mechanism that hosts can use to find routers, independent of
any routing protocol. Router discovery allows a host to ask what
routers are on its network, using something called a <em class="emphasis">router
solicitation</em>, and get back an answer from each router. The
routers can also provide information about relative desirability.
That is, each router sends a number indicating how good it thinks it
is, configured by the administrator who set up the router. The host
can then use this information to pick a router. That's all the
information the host gets from the router; there's no
information about what networks the router is connected to, for
instance.</p><p>





In addition to responding to requests from hosts, routers send out
the same information periodically. Whether or not it's been
requested, it is called a <em class="emphasis">router announcement</em>,
and hosts are supposed to treat unsolicited announcements the same
way they treat announcements they've asked for.</p><p>





Router discovery is a useful way for hosts to find default routers
without needing to implement complicated routing protocols. However,
it contains no authentication information at all, allowing attackers
to send out router announcements that will divert traffic. If the
attacker is on the network being attacked, those announcements could
divert traffic to where the attacker could read or modify it. If the
attacker doesn't have a point of presence on the network,
there's less benefit to the attacker. Denial of service attacks
are certainly possible, and in a few cases, an attacker might be able
to divert traffic to another network that the attacker was present
on.</p><p>





Router discovery is not widely implemented, and most hosts that use
it do so as a supplement to other ways of configuring routing. You
may therefore have hosts that are using router discovery without
knowing it. These hosts will already have routes configured by some
other means (using RIP announcements, DHCP, or simply having some
human type them in somewhere). How these hosts treat router
announcements is entirely implementation dependent. Many of them will
use announced routers instead of routers they knew about from other
sources; others will apply a ranking based on the information in the
announcement; and some of them will prefer preconfigured routers to
announced routers.</p><p>





There is absolutely no reason for router discovery to ever go through
a router. Router discovery is intended only to convey information
about the local network. It is therefore safe and advisable to filter
it out in all packet filtering routers. You will also want to turn
off router discovery on bastion hosts, in order to be sure that they
are not going to pay attention to invalid announcements if other
bastion hosts are compromised.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.5. Proxying Characteristics of Routing Protocols</h3>





Because routing protocols are used by a host to develop routing
tables that are specific to where that host is in the network, it
doesn't make any sense to proxy routing protocols to hosts
elsewhere in the network.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.6. Network Address Translation Characteristics of Routing Protocols</h3>





Routing protocols transfer information that's highly dependent
on network addresses and is certain to be pointless if it passes
through a network address translator. It doesn't make any sense
to run network address translation on routing protocols.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.7. Summary of Recommendations for Routing Protocols</h3>





<ul><li>Do not allow routing protocols (RIP or otherwise) across your
firewall to or from the Internet. Routing on the firewall is
generally very simple and is accomplished best with static routes.
Simply configure the firewall to direct packets bound for internal
source addresses to an internal router and to direct all other
packets to your Internet connection.</p><p></li><li>Configure routing on bastion hosts carefully, in order to provide
depth of defense against problems with the firewall or other bastion
hosts and some level of protection against local
misconfiguration.<a name="INDEX-2065" /> <a name="INDEX-2066" /></p><p></li></ul>
