Earlier we discussed TCP, UDP, and other protocols directly based on
IP. Many application protocols are based directly on those protocols,
but others use intermediary protocols. Understanding these
intermediary protocols is important to understanding the applications
that are built on them. This chapter discusses various
general-purpose protocols that are used to build numerous
applications or higher-level protocols.</p><p>





We discuss intermediary protocols here because they form the basis
for many of the protocols we discuss later. However, intermediary
protocols are usually invisible, and they are often complex. If you
are not already familiar with network protocols, you may want to skip
this chapter initially, and come back to it as needed.</p><p>



















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch14-4739" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">14.1. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1269" /></a>The term
"RPC", or remote procedure call, can be used for almost
any mechanism that lets a program do something that looks to the
programmer like making a simple procedure call but that actually
contacts another program. However, it's also the name of some
particular protocols for this purpose, which are extremely
widespread.<a name="INDEX-1270" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1271" /></a></p><p>





ultiple remote procedure call protocols are known as RPCs. In
particular, on Unix systems, the protocol normally known as
"RPC" is one developed by Sun and later standardized as
Open Network Computing RPC. On Microsoft systems, the protocol
normally known as "RPC" is compatible with a descendent
of Sun's RPC standardized by the Open Systems Foundation (OSF)
as part of its Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). For clarity,
we will call these "Sun RPC" and "Microsoft
RPC". It is arguably more correct to call them "ONC
RPC" and "DCE RPC"; however, we find that in this
case, correctness and clarity are at odds with each other.</p><p>





Other remote procedure call mechanisms are used on particular
implementations, but these two account for most of the market, and
the other RPC mechanisms are similar in concept and difficulties. For
simplicity, when we are making statements that refer to all protocols
we know of that anybody calls "RPC", we'll say just
"RPC".</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1272" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1273" /></a>Sun RPC and
icrosoft RPC are quite similar and are related, but they do not
interoperate. Microsoft RPC is an implementation of DCE RPC and can
interoperate with other DCE RPC implementations. Some Unix machines
support both Sun RPC and DCE RPC (usually Sun RPC is a default, and
DCE RPC is an option or an add-on product). In practice, even if you
run DCE RPC on a Unix machine, you will very rarely notice any
interoperability with Microsoft RPC. The DCE RPC standard covers only
a small amount of functionality, and most applications use features
that are not in the base set. These features are not guaranteed to be
interoperable between implementations. Since DCE RPC is relatively
little used on Unix, Unix applications often stick to base features.
icrosoft, however, makes extensive use of RPC and needs more
functionality. They therefore almost always use incompatible features
(mostly by using DCOM, which is discussed later). This is the main
reason for our stubborn insistence on referring to "Microsoft
RPC"; we are attempting to avoid the suggestion that Microsoft
applications that use RPC can be expected to work with other DCE RPC
servers or clients.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1274" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1275" /></a>Like TCP and UDP, the RPCs are used as
general-purpose transport protocols by a variety of application
protocols; on Unix machines, this includes NFS and NIS, and on
Windows NT machines, it includes Microsoft Exchange and the
administrator applications for a number of services, including DHCP
and Exchange. NFS and NIS are vulnerable services from a network
security point of view. An attacker with access to your NFS server
can probably read any file on your system. An attacker with access to
your NIS server can probably obtain your password file and then run a
password-cracking attack against your system. The Windows NT
applications that use RPC are less security-critical but by no means
safe. While it's not immediately fatal to have an attacker
controlling your mail server, it's not pleasant
either.<a name="INDEX-1276" /></a></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1277" /></a>In
the TCP and UDP protocols, port numbers are two-byte fields. This
means that there are only 65,536 possible port numbers for TCP and
UDP services. There aren't enough ports to be able to assign a
unique well-known port number to every possible service and
application that might want one. Among other things, RPC addresses
this limitation. Each RPC-based service is assigned a unique
four-byte <em class="emphasis">RPC service number</em>. This allows for
4,294,967,296 different services, each with a unique number.
That's more than enough to assign a unique number to every
possible service and application you'd need.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1278" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1279" /></a>RPC is built on top of TCP and UDP, so
there needs to be some way of mapping the RPC service numbers of the
RPC-based servers in use on a machine to the particular TCP or UDP
ports those servers are using. This is where the location server
comes in. On Unix machines, the location server is a program called
<em class="emphasis">portmapper</em> ; under Windows NT, it's the
RPC Locator service. The functions and characteristics of the two are
the same.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1280" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1281" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1282" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1283" /></a>The location server is the only
RPC-related server that is guaranteed to run on a particular TCP or
UDP port number (for Sun RPC, it is at port number 111 on both; for
icrosoft RPC, it is at port number 135 on both). When an RPC-based
server such as an NFS or NIS server starts, it allocates a TCP and/or
UDP (some use one, some the other, some both) port for itself. Then,
it contacts the location server on the same
machine to "register" its unique RPC service number and
the particular port(s) it is using at the moment.</p><p>





Servers usually choose arbitrary port numbers, but they can
consistently choose the same port number every time if they wish.
There is no guarantee that a server that does this will be able to
register itself; some other server may have gotten there first, in
which case the registration will fail. Obviously, if every server
requests a fixed port number, there's not much point in using
RPC at all. One of the major features of RPC is that it provides
access that is not based on fixed port numbers.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1284" /></a>An
RPC-based client program that wishes to contact a particular
RPC-based server on a machine first contacts the location server on
that machine (which, remember, always runs on both TCP and UDP port
111 or 135). The client tells the location server the unique RPC
service number for the server it wishes to access, and the location
server responds with a message saying, in effect, either
"I'm sorry, but that service isn't available on
this machine at the moment", or "That service is
currently running on TCP (or UDP) port <em class="emphasis">n</em> on this
machine at the moment". At that point, the client contacts the
server on the port number it got from the location server and
continues its conversation directly with the server, without further
involvement from the location server. (<a href="ch14_01.html#ch14-40129">Figure 14-1</a>
shows this process.)</p><p>





<a name="ch14-40129" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="231" alt="Figure 14-1" src="figs/fire2.1401.gif" width="428" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 14-1. RPC and the portmapper</h4>

The Sun RPC location service also implements an optimization of this
process that allows an RPC client to send a service lookup request
and an RPC call in a single request. The location service not only
returns the information, but also forwards the RPC call to the
appropriate service. The service that receives the request will see
the IP address of the local machine instead of the IP address of the
machine that sent the query. This has caused a number of security
problems for RPC services, since many of them perform authentication
based upon the source IP addresses of the request. This feature
should normally be disabled.</p><p>





<a name="ch14-2-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.1.1. Sun RPC Authentication</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1285" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1286" /></a>In Sun RPC, each server application
chooses what kind of authentication it wants. Two authentication
schemes are available in normal Sun RPC, known as
"AUTH_NONE" and "AUTH_UNIX". If you have a
Kerberos installation and a recent implementation of Sun RPC,
applications can use "AUTH_KERB" to do Kerberos
authentication.</p><p>





Logically enough, "AUTH_NONE" means that there is no
authentication at all. Applications that use AUTH_NONE are available
to all users and ask for no authentication data.
"AUTH_UNIX" could more appropriately be called
"AUTH_ALMOST_NONE". Applications that use
"AUTH_UNIX" ask the client to provide the numeric Unix
user and group IDs for the user and enforce the permissions
appropriate to those user and group IDs on the server machine. This
information is completely forgeable; a hostile client can provide any
user or group ID that seems desirable.</p><p>





RPC servers are free to implement their own authentication schemes,
but Sun RPC does not normally provide any reliable authentication for
them except through Secure RPC. You do not want to allow access to
RPC services unless you are sure that they do have their own,
reliable authentication. (In general, this means simply disabling
remote access to RPC altogether.)</p><p>





Secure RPC provides another authentication scheme, known as
"AUTH_DES". Secure RPC is an extension to Sun RPC that
improves user authentication. Secure RPC has become available much
more slowly than normal Sun RPC; for many years, Sun was effectively
the only vendor that supported it, and it is still relatively rare
and difficult to use in large heterogeneous networks.</p><p>





This is partly because Secure RPC requires more infrastructure than
regular RPC, and this infrastructure is often annoyingly visible to
the user. Logically, Secure RPC is a classic combination of public
key cryptography and secret key cryptography; Diffie-Hellman public
key cryptography is used to securely determine a shared secret used
for encryption with the DES algorithm. Cryptography, Diffie-Hellman,
and the DES algorithm are discussed further in <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1287" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1288" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1289" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1290" /></a>Secure RPC is based upon using a public
key algorithm that has a maximum key size of only 192 bits in length.
This size of key is too small and is considered to make Secure RPC
vulnerable to factoring attacks, where an attacker can discover the
private key from computations based upon captured key exchange data.
An attacker would have to use considerable computing resources to
break a key, but once a key was broken, it could be used to
impersonate the user at any place those credentials were used.</p><p>





There are two major difficulties: distributing information about
public keys, and getting private keys for human beings. Public and
private keys are both big numbers, and they're security
critical. If somebody can change the database of public keys, that
person can put his or her public key in place of some other public
key, and authenticate as any entity he or she would like to be. If
somebody can read a private key, he or she can then authenticate as
the entity that owns that private key. Normally, you might deal with
this by not storing the private key on the computer, but human beings
are very bad at providing large numbers on demand.</p><p>





The Secure RPC infrastructure can deal with the public key
information in a number of ways. On Suns, the normal method is to use
NIS+, which has a credentials database. You can also distribute the
same information as a regular NIS map or as a file. If you put the
information in a file, you then have to distribute the file, which is
normally done with NFS. As we discuss in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>, normal NIS is not secure; therefore, if you
distribute the public key information this way, it will be vulnerable
to replacement by attackers. As we discuss in <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>, normal NFS isn't secure, either. To
secure it, you run NFS over Secure RPC, which isn't going to
work if you need to have access to NFS before you can get Secure RPC
running. If you're going to rely on Secure RPC, you must ensure
that the public keys are distributed via a secure method (which will
generally be NIS+). NIS+ itself uses Secure RPC, but because it is
authenticating as the machine (instead of as a particular user, which
is necessary for NFS), and is communicating with a known server, it
can locally store the information necessary to start up a connection
to the NIS+ service, avoiding the bootstrapping problem.</p><p>





The private key information is also handled by NIS or NIS+. It is
distributed in an encrypted form and decrypted using a user-supplied
password. <a name="INDEX-1291" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1292" /></a></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.1.2. Microsoft RPC Authentication</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1293" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1294" /></a>Microsoft RPC does provide an
authentication system, but not all operating systems support it (in
particular, it is supported on Windows NT, but not on Windows 95 or
Windows 98). As a result, very few applications actually use RPC
authentication, since it limits the platforms the application can run
on and requires extra programming effort. Instead, applications that
need security with Microsoft RPC usually use RPC over SMB instead of
using RPC directly over TCP/IP, and use SMB authentication. (SMB is
described later in this chapter.)</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch14-4-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.1.3. Packet Filtering Characteristics of RPC</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1295" /></a>It's very difficult to use packet
filtering to control RPC-based services because you don't
usually know what port the service will be using on a particular
machine  --  and chances are that the port used will change every
time the machine is rebooted. Blocking access to the location server
isn't sufficient. An attacker can bypass the step of talking to
the location server and simply try all TCP and/or UDP ports (the
65,536 possible ports can all be checked on a particular machine in a
matter of minutes), looking for the response expected from a
particular RPC-based server like NFS or NIS.</p><p>

Some newer packet filtering products can talk to the location server
to determine what services are where and filter on that basis. Note
that this has to be verified on a per-packet basis for UDP-based
services. The packet filter will have to contact the location server
every time it receives a packet, because if the machine has rebooted,
the service may have moved. Because TCP is connection-oriented, the
port number has to be verified only on a per-connection basis. Using
this mechanism to allow UDP-based services is going to result in high
overhead and is probably not wise for applications that perform a lot
of RPC.</p><p>

Even though it is not sufficient, you should still block access to

So, what do you do to guard RPC-based services? A couple of
observations: First, it turns out that most of the
"dangerous" RPC-based services (particularly NIS and NFS)
are offered by default over UDP. Second, most services you'd
want to access through a packet filter are TCP-based,
<em class="emphasis">not</em> UDP-based; the notable exceptions are DNS,
NTP, and <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>. These twin observations lead to
the common approach many sites take in dealing with RPC using packet
filtering: block UDP altogether, except for specific and tightly
controlled "peepholes" for DNS, NTP, and
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em>. With this approach, if you wish to allow
any TCP-based RPC service in a given direction, you'll need to
allow them all, or use a packet filter that can contact the location
service.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1296" /></a>Windows NT provides more control over the
ports used by RPC. This will help if you want to allow remote clients
to access your servers, but it will not help you allow internal
clients to access external servers (unless you can talk the owners of
the servers into modifying their machines). Most uses of RPC are
actually uses of DCOM, which provides a user interface to configuring
ports that is discussed later in this chapter. You can also control
the size of the port range used by RPC directly. To limit the size of
the port range, modify the following registry key:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\RPC</pre></blockquote>





so that the "Ports" key is set to the port range you wish
to use, the "PortsInternetAvailable" key is set to
"Y", and "UseInternetPorts" is also set to
"Y".</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1297" /></a>The
procedure for setting the port for a given service varies from
service to service. It is sometimes documented in the manuals, and
the Microsoft web site gives instructions on setting RPC ports for
services that are particularly frequently used through firewalls.
Again, most RPC services are DCOM services, and there is a user
interface for changing DCOM parameters. It is worth checking the DCOM
interface even if you see documentation that advises you to edit the
registry directly.</p><p>





If you set the port that a service uses, be sure to pick a port that
is not in use by another server, and a port that is not at the
beginning of the RPC port range. Since most servers choose the first
free number in the RPC port range, a server that asks for a number
very close to the beginning of the port range is quite likely to find
it already in use. At this point, either the server will fail to
start at all, because the RPC registration fails, or the server will
select a random port and start on it. In either case, remote clients
who are relying on the server being at a fixed port number will be
unable to access it.<a name="INDEX-1298" /></a></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.1.4. Proxying Characteristics of RPC</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1299" /></a>RPC is
difficult to proxy for many of the same reasons that make it
difficult to protect with packet filtering. Using RPC requires using
the location service, and the proxy server needs to proxy both the
location service and the specific service that is being provided.
<a href="ch14_01.html#ch14-36842">Figure 14-2</a> shows the process that an RPC proxy
needs to go through.</p><p>





<a name="ch14-36842" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="145" alt="Figure 14-2" src="figs/fire2.1402.gif" width="435" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 14-2. Proxying RPC</h4>

Normal modified-client proxy systems, like SOCKS, do not support RPC,
and no modified-procedure proxies are available for it. This means
that there's no external way for the proxy to determine what
server the client is trying to contact. Either the client has to be
configured to speak RPC to the proxy server, which then always
connects to the same actual server, or the proxy server must run as a
transparent proxy service, where a router intercepts traffic,
complete with server addresses, and hands them to the proxy.</p><p>





A number of transparent proxy servers do support Sun RPC; a smaller
number are now adding support for DCE/Microsoft RPC. Products vary in
the amount of support they provide, with some providing all-or-none
support, and others allowing you to specify which RPC services you
wish to allow.</p><p>

<a name="ch14-8-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.1.5. Network Address Translation Characteristics of RPC</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1300" /></a>None of the RPC versions uses embedded IP
addresses; there is no inherent problem using them with network
address translation systems that modify only host addresses. On the
other hand, the information returned by the location service does
include port numbers. Using RPC with a network address translation
system that modifies port numbers will require a system that's
able to interpret and modify the responses from the location server
so that they show the translated port numbers. In addition, protocols
built on top of RPC are free to exchange IP addresses or pay
attention to source IP addresses as well as RPC information, so there
is no guarantee that all RPC applications will work. In particular,
both NIS and NFS use IP source addresses as authenticators and will
have to be carefully configured to work with the translated
addresses. As discussed in the next section, DCOM, which is the
primary user of Microsoft RPC, uses embedded source addresses and
will not work with network address translation.</p><p>
