<h2 class="sect1">13.3. Analyzing Other Protocols</h2>





In this book, we discuss a large number of protocols, but inevitably
there are some that we've left out. We've left out
protocols that we felt were no longer popular (like FSP, which
appeared in the first edition), protocols that change often
(including protocols for specific games), protocols that are rarely
run through firewalls (including most routing protocols), and
protocols where there are large numbers of competitors with no single
clear leader (including remote access protocols for Windows
machines). And those are just the protocols that we intentionally
decided to leave out; there are also all the protocols that we
haven't heard about, that we forgot about, or that hadn't
been invented yet when we wrote this edition.</p><p>





How do you go about analyzing protocols that we don't discuss
in this book? The first question to ask is: Do you really need to run
the protocol across your firewall? Perhaps there is some other
satisfactory way to provide or access the service desired using a
protocol already supported by your firewall. Maybe there is some way
to solve the underlying problem without providing the service across
the firewall at all. It's even possible that the protocol is so
risky that there is no satisfactory justification for running it.
Before you worry about how to provide a protocol, analyze the problem
you're trying to solve.</p><p>





If you really need to provide a protocol across your firewall, and
it's not discussed in later chapters, how do you determine what
ports it uses and so on? While it's sometimes possible to
determine this information from program, protocol, or standards
documentation, the easiest way to figure it out is usually to ask
somebody else, such as the members of the Firewalls mailing
list<a href="#FOOTNOTE-27">[27]</a> (see <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>).</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-27" />[27]But make sure you check the archives first, to
see if the question has already been asked and answered.</p><p>




</blockquote>





If you have to determine the answer yourself, the easiest way to do
it is usually empirically. Here's what you should do:</p><p>





<ol><li>Set up a test system that's running as little as possible other
than the application you want to test.</p><p></li><li>Next, set up another system to monitor the packets to and from the
test system (using <em class="emphasis">etherfind</em>, Network Monitor,
<em class="emphasis">netsnoop, tcpdump,</em> or some other package that
lets you watch traffic on the local network). Note that this system
must be able to see the traffic; if you are attaching systems to a
switch, you will need to put the monitoring system on an
administrative port, or otherwise rearrange your networking so that
the traffic can be monitored.</p><p></li><li>Run the application on the test system and see what the monitoring
system records.</p><p></li></ol>
You may need to repeat this procedure for every client implementation
and every server implementation you intend to use. There are
occasionally unpredictable differences between implementations (e.g.,
some DNS clients always use TCP, even though most DNS clients use UDP
by default).</p><p>





<a name="ch13-19-fm2xml" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Finding Assigned Port Numbers</h4>





<a name="INDEX-1240" />Port
numbers are officially assigned by the Internet Assigned Number
Authority (IANA). They used to be documented in an IETF RFC; a new
assigned numbers RFC was issued every few years (generally carefully
timed to be a round number). These days, this would be an extremely
large document, so instead, all numbers assigned by IANA are
documented by files at an FTP site:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments</pre></blockquote>





Port numbers are found in the file named
<em class="filename">port-numbers</em>. Not all protocols use well-defined
and legally assigned port numbers, and the names that protocols are
given in the assignments list are sometimes misleading (for instance,
there are numerous listed protocols with names like
"sqlnet" and "sql-net", none of which is
Oracle's SQL*Net). Nonetheless, this is a useful starting place
for clues about the relationship between protocols and port numbers.</p><p>

You may also find it useful to use a general-purpose client to
connect to the server to see what it's doing. Some text-based
services will work perfectly well if you simply connect with a Telnet
client (see <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>, for more information about
Telnet). Others are UDP-based or otherwise more particular, but you
can usually use <em class="emphasis">netcat</em> to connect to them (see
<a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>, for information on where to find
<em class="emphasis">netcat).</em> You should avoid doing this kind of
testing on production machines; it's not unusual to discover
that simple typing mistakes are sufficient to cause servers to go
haywire. This is something useful to know before you allow anybody to
access the server from the Internet, but it's upsetting to
discover it by crashing a production
system.<a name="INDEX-1241" /></p><p>





This sort of detective work will be simplified if you have a tool
that allows you to match a port number to a process (without looking
at every running process). Although <em class="emphasis">netstat</em> will
tell you which ports are in use, it doesn't always tell you the
processes that are using them. A popular tool for this purpose on
Windows NT is <em class="emphasis">inzider</em><a name="INDEX-1242" /> <a name="INDEX-1243" /> <a name="INDEX-1244" />. Under Unix, this is usually done with
<em class="emphasis">fuser</em>, which is provided with the operating
system on most systems; versions of Unix that do not have
<em class="emphasis">fuser</em> will probably have an equivalent with some
other name. Another useful Unix tool for examining ports and the
programs that are using them is <em class="emphasis">lsof.
</em>Information on finding <em class="emphasis">inzider</em> and
<em class="emphasis">lsof</em> is in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>.<a name="INDEX-1245" /></p><p>
