<h2 class="sect1">11.4. Installing and Modifying Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-973" /> <a name="INDEX-974" /> <a name="INDEX-975" /><a name="INDEX-976" /><a name="INDEX-977" /><a name="INDEX-978" />Some of the services you want to provide
may not be provided with your operating system (for example, web
servers generally are not). Others may be provided in versions that
are inappropriate for use in a secure environment or that are missing
features you probably want (for example, stock
<em class="emphasis">fingerd</em> and <em class="emphasis">ftpd</em> ). Even
those few remaining services that are provided, secure, and up to
date in your vendor's operating system release should be
protected with the TCP Wrapper package or the
<em class="emphasis">netacl</em> program from TIS FWTK to improve security
and provide logging. (Although TCP Wrapper and
<em class="emphasis">netacl</em> will increase security, they're not
perfect; they rely on the source IP address to identify hosts, and IP
addresses can be forged.)</p><p>





For detailed information about individual services, including advice
on selecting HTTP, NNTP, and FTP servers, see the chapters in <a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a>.</p><p>





Whatever services you do leave enabled should also be protected to
the extent possible by the TCP Wrapper package or the
<em class="emphasis">netacl</em> program, as we describe in the following
sections. For example, you might want to set up your bastion host so
that it accepts Telnet connections from only one specific machine,
such as the workstation you normally use.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">11.4.1. Using the TCP Wrapper Package to Protect Services</h3>





<a name="INDEX-979" /><a name="INDEX-980" />
<a name="INDEX-981" /><a name="INDEX-982" />The TCP Wrapper package, written by
Wietse Venema, monitors incoming network traffic and controls network
activity. It is a simple but very effective piece of publicly
available software set up to run whenever certain ports
(corresponding to certain services) are connected. TCP Wrapper
provides simple access control list protection, as well as improved
logging, for services that are started by <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>.</p><p>





Using the TCP Wrapper package is easy. Here's what you do:</p><p>





<ol><li>Install the package and set up a pair of simple access control files
that define which hosts and networks are allowed to access which
services.</p><p></li><li><a name="INDEX-983" />Reconfigure
your <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> to run the main TCP Wrapper program
(called <em class="emphasis">tcpd</em> ) instead of the "real"
server.</p><p></li><li>When a request for a service comes in, <em class="emphasis">inetd</em>
starts <em class="emphasis">tcpd</em>, which evaluates the request against
the TCP Wrapper configuration files. This program decides whether or
not to log the request, and whether or not to carry out the request.</p><p></li><li>If <em class="emphasis">tcpd</em> decides that the request is acceptable,
it starts the "real" server to process the request.</p><p></li></ol>
<a name="ch11-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.4.1.1. TCP Wrapper example</h3>





For example, if you want to allow Telnet connections from a specific
host (e.g., 172.16.1.2) to your machine, but deny Telnet connections
from all other hosts, you would change the line for
<em class="emphasis">telnetd</em> in your
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> file to say something like:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/libexec/tcpd telnetd</pre></blockquote>





You would also need to create an
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.allow</em> file that tells the TCP Wrapper
package (the <em class="emphasis">tcpd</em> program) which host to allow
connections from:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">telnetd : 172.16.1.2</pre></blockquote>





<a name="INDEX-984" /> <a name="INDEX-985" />
<a name="INDEX-986" />And finally, you'd need to create an
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.deny</em> file to tell the TCP Wrapper
package to deny all connections from all hosts by default, and to
send email to root about each probe:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : ALL : (/usr/local/etc/safe_finger -l @%h | \ 
    /usr/ucb/Mail -s "PROBE %d from %c" root)&amp;</pre></blockquote>





Note that the <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.deny</em> file only applies
to services protected by the TCP Wrapper package (that is, services
for which you've configured <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> to run
<em class="emphasis">tcpd</em> instead of the real server). If you
don't tell <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> to run the TCP Wrapper
package (the <em class="emphasis">tcpd</em> program) for a given service,
then the TCP Wrapper package won't do anything regarding that
service.</p><p>





Despite its name, the TCP Wrapper package supports UDP-based services
in addition to TCP-based services. Be aware, however, that the TCP
Wrapper package can only control when to <em class="emphasis">start</em>
UDP-based servers; it cannot control access to those servers once
they're started, and many UDP-based servers are designed to
process requests for some period of time beyond the initial startup
request. Many eventually time out and exit, but once they've
been started through a legitimate request, they're vulnerable
to illegitimate requests.</p><p>





In addition, TCP Wrapper relies on the source IP address for
authentication. It is relatively difficult to spoof source IP
addresses when TCP is used, because the connection setup process
requires a dialog between the source and the destination. It is much
easier to spoof source IP addresses when using UDP, so TCP Wrapper
provides less protection.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">11.4.1.2. Using netacl to protect services</h3>





<a name="INDEX-987" /><a name="INDEX-988" />The <em class="emphasis">netacl</em>
component of TIS FWTK (described in some detail in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>) provides much the same capability as the TCP
Wrapper package. To implement the same example as the one shown in
the previous section (except for the ability to trace probes from
unauthorized systems) using <em class="emphasis">netacl</em>, you would
change the line for <em class="emphasis">telnetd</em> in your
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> file to:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/lib/netacl telnetd</pre></blockquote>





Then, you would add the following lines to your FWTK
<em class="emphasis">netperm</em> configuration file (wherever that is on
your system):</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">netacl-telnetd: permit-hosts 172.16.1.2 -exec /usr/libexec/telnetd</pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">11.4.2. Evaluating and Configuring Unix Services</h3>





If you need to install a new service on a bastion host, you will want
to secure it as much as possible. You should not assume that services
are safe; reputable software companies often ship unsafe packages,
and in many cases, their worst problems are easy to find and repair.</p><p>





Install a test copy of the service on a machine that is otherwise
stable and will not change while you are doing the installation. Use
<em class="filename">find</em> to identify all the files that were changed
during the installation, and check to make sure that those files are
acceptable. In particular:</p><p>





<ul><li>Make sure that file permissions are as restrictive as possible;
arbitrary users shouldn't be able to write to any executables,
configuration files, or temporary directories. If possible, limit
read and execute permissions as well.</p><p></li><li>Closely check all programs that have the <em class="emphasis">setuid</em>
bit set, particularly if they are <em class="emphasis">setuid</em> to
root. If they can run without <em class="emphasis">setuid</em>, or if it
is at all possible to avoid running them, remove
<em class="emphasis">setuid</em> permissions.</p><p></li><li>If the program installs a user account, make sure that the password
is set to something other than the program's default. If
possible, change the account name to something other than the
program's default; attackers will often focus on well-known
account names.</p><p></li><li>Make sure that all programs are run by users with appropriate
permissions. Do not run services as root unless they need to be run
as root (for instance, to use ports below 1024). If you must run
services as root, try to run them under <em class="emphasis">chroot</em>
to control what they can access.</p><p></li><li>If you add special user accounts for services, make sure that they
cannot be used as normal login accounts; both the password and shell
entries should be invalid, so that attackers cannot use the accounts
as entry points.</p><p></li><li><a name="INDEX-993" />Check any
additions the program has made to startup files or
<em class="emphasis">crontab</em> files.<a name="INDEX-994" /></p><p></li></ul>
