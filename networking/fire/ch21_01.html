Services can get information about how to identify users, and what
users are allowed to do, from various sources. For instance, they can
keep local files (this is what Unix web servers do when they use
"basic" authentication), or they can use the operating
system's normal methods (this is what Windows NT web servers do
when they use "Windows NT Challenge/Response"
authentication). However, there is now a third popular option, a
centralized authentication service that is independent of the
specific service and the specific computer the service is running on.
That service makes up part of something often referred to as an
<em class="emphasis">AAA server</em>.<a name="INDEX-1940" /></a></p><p>





An <a name="INDEX-1941" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1942" /></a>AAA
server (sometimes spoken as "Triple A server") provides
authentication, authorization, and auditing services:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Authentication</em></i><a name="INDEX-1943" /></a><i></i></dt>
<dd>The process of obtaining verified, proven identification.
Authentication determines who somebody or something is.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Authorization</em></i></dt>
<dd>The process of determining what somebody can do. Don't confuse
authentication and authorization. Authentication is a prerequisite
for authorization (unless everybody is authorized to do something,
such as anonymous FTP).</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Auditing</em></i></dt>
<dd>Provides information on when authentication and authorization was
granted or denied.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Authentication services attempt to prove identity, to ensure that you
know what person you are dealing with. This task can be very easy if
it doesn't matter very much and you are in an environment you
trust, or very difficult if people may be trying to deceive you. In
many contexts, you'll accept someone's business card as
an authentication. If you're suspicious, you may want something
better, or you may want to check up on the information on the card.
You might call the phone number on the card, for instance (but the
person carrying the card certainly can control where that phone
number goes). If you were really worried, you might get a phone
number from an external source and call it.</p><p>





Similarly, authentication services can be relatively simple when
they're used on internal, trusted networks but are quite
complex when they can't assume a basic level of trust. What
happens if you're trying to verify that business card, but the
person carrying it actually controls your telephone system, so no
matter what number you call, that person can answer the telephone?
That's effectively the situation you face when you're
trying to authenticate somebody over an untrusted network connection.</p><p>





Normal Unix password systems, and older Microsoft systems, use
authentication methods equivalent to simply accepting business cards
and trusting what they say. They use reusable tokens, and any time
you give one out, somebody might be storing it away to use later
while pretending to be you. Strong authentication services go to
considerable lengths to ensure that what is transmitted over the
network cannot be used to impersonate you at some point in the
future.</p><p>





Some services that are also sometimes used for authentication have
been covered earlier in this book. For information on NIS and LDAP,
see <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>.</p><p>




















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch21-20321" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">21.1. What Is Authentication?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1944" /></a><a name="INDEX-1945" /></a>Usually, people think of authentication in
terms of passwords. Although passwords are frequently used for
authentication, there are actually a variety of authentication
mechanisms. These mechanisms can generally be categorized as
verifying one or more of the following:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Something you are</i></dt>
<dd>This is the field of biometrics, including techniques such as
fingerprint scans, retina scans, voiceprint analysis, and so on.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Something you know</i></dt>
<dd>This is a traditional password system.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Something you have</i></dt>
<dd>This includes mechanisms such as challenge-response lists, one-time
pads, smart cards, and so on.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Some systems combine these approaches. For example, a smart card that
requires the user to enter a personal identification number (PIN) to
unlock it is a combination of something you have (the card) and
something you know (the PIN). In theory, it is considered a good idea
to combine at least two mechanisms because people can steal either
one: the thing you have is susceptible to ordinary theft, and the
thing you know is compromised by sniffing if it passes over the
Internet; but it's rare for somebody to be able to get both at
once. Automatic teller machines use this combination. However, ATMs
also demonstrate the flaw in the theory: when you are authenticating
(standing at the ATM), you reveal what you have (your card) and what
you know (your PIN) simultaneously, making yourself vulnerable to a
thief who watches you use the machine to capture your PIN, then
steals your card as you leave, or to a fraudulent ATM machine, which
can pick up your PIN and your card at the same time.</p><p>





<a name="ch21-20353" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.1.1. Something You Are</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1946" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1947" /></a><a name="INDEX-1948" /></a>Many types of biometric systems
are in use or under development today; they test such diverse
personal characteristics as your voice, your fingerprint or
handprint, your retina, your signature, and your typing patterns.
Biometric systems are extremely attractive because they get around
the problems associated with using things that can be stolen or
revealed. (Even the horror movie scenario of hacking off
somebody's thumb to use in the fingerprint scanner is taken
into account; most scanners insist that a pulse be present.)
Unfortunately, biometric systems are not practical for normal
Internet applications.</p><p>





ost computers do not come with devices capable of reading
fingerprints, much less retinas. Voiceprint technology is more
tempting; it's not unusual for machines these days to have
microphones. But it's not universal, either, and you
can't guarantee that every machine you'll want to log in
from has the high quality microphone, free disk space, and available
network bandwidth required for this approach. Finally, if the
biometric information has to be communicated from where you are to
where it can be checked, you run the risk of an attacker's
capturing it and replaying it later, unless you have some way of
encrypting or otherwise protecting it.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1949" /></a>Even if every machine had all the
capabilities it needed, reliable voiceprint identification is
surprisingly hard to accomplish. Many people wish to use their
computers even when they have head colds, which throw off many
voice-recognition systems. You can't use a fixed phrase as a
password, or you would be vulnerable to a literal playback attack
involving a tape recorder. (These problems have been addressed in
dedicated systems, but no authentication systems widely available for
general-purpose computers can deal with them, and it's not at
all trivial to develop one.) You can't use a different phrase
every time because voiceprint comparison on arbitrary text is not a
real-time operation  --  unless you have a spare supercomputer
lying around to do it. Almost everybody wants to log in with a delay
measured in seconds, at worst; getting back to the user with an
answer in a few hours is not going to work.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1950" /></a>Keystroke timing, used to
characterize someone's typing pattern, is a surprisingly
reliable biometric identification system and requires no special
hardware. The computer provides a phrase to type and then times the
gaps between characters as you type it. On a phrase of reasonable
length, people type in an identifiable pattern, and imitating it is
much harder than it looks. Like voiceprints, keystroke timings may
change for environmental reasons; in the case of keystroke timings,
colds aren't a problem, but people have great difficulty
authenticating while drunk (which is not necessarily a disadvantage,
of course). The genuine disadvantage is that keystroke timings can be
gathered only at the machine to which the keyboard is attached. That
means that use of this method across the Internet requires modified
clients. In addition, some people, mostly poor typists, have trouble
ever authenticating because their typing patterns are inconsistent.</p><p>





Biometric solutions are slowly improving over time; the cost of the
add-on hardware is dropping, and the effectiveness of the software is
increasing. However, manufacturers have been promising that
biometrics are going to be universally accepted Real Soon Now for
many years, and there is no sign that they are likely to overcome the
hurdles any time soon. If you have special security needs that
warrant adding hardware to every machine that people may need to
authenticate from, a biometric solution may be appropriate, but for
most sites, biometrics are still in the distant future.</p><p>

<a name="ch21-20367" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.1.2. Something You Know</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1951" /></a>If
the long-lost heiress to a fortune turns up in a novel, you can bet
that fingerprints aren't going to be available to do biometric
authentication. Instead, the claimant is probably going to try to
prove that she is who she says she is because she knows the name of
the stuffed animal she slept with at age three. This is
authentication by knowledge, just like the traditional Unix password
system. (And, just like traditional Unix passwords, the
claimant's answers can be faked if she's a good guesser
and gets enough tries.)</p><p>





Authentication that depends on something you know relies on that
something's being both hard to guess and secret. In order for
you to authenticate reliably, you have to know the secret reliably,
too. This isn't as easy as it sounds. Most people are bad at
making up and remembering unguessable things, and they're worse
at keeping secrets. If you use short keys, it's easy to guess
them; if you use long keys, it's hard to remember them. If you
write them down, you're basically converting to a different
type of authentication; now, it's something you have.</p><p>





System administrators who unblushingly tell their users never to
write down passwords probably have a few stashed in their wallets
anyway; this is a combination of "what you know" and
"what you have". "What you know" is how to
read your own handwriting, and which slip of paper contains the
passwords, rather than last week's lunch order. "What you
have" is the slip of paper itself.</p><p>





Despite all of the risks of "what you know" systems, it
is still practical to use them as long as you aren't revealing
the secret to everybody in the near vicinity every time you
authenticate. There is a reason why passwords are so popular:
they're fast, they're cheap, and, in practice, people
don't forget them or lose the pieces of paper all that often.
However, it is absolutely impractical to pass them across the
Internet in any form that can be used safely.</p><p>





Is there any way to use a "what you know" system safely
on the Internet? Yes -- use passwords but make sure that they are
nonreusable (one-time) passwords.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1952" /></a><a name="INDEX-1953" /></a>There are two ways to make
traditional, memorized passwords nonreusable. One is to include an
<em class="emphasis">encrypted timestamp</em>  --  this is the method
that Kerberos uses. As long as you can't modify the timestamp
without knowing the password, it prevents playback. Unfortunately, it
requires two things:</p><p>





<ul><li>Special client software that knows how to timestamp the password.</p><p></li><li>Synchronized time between the client and the server. If the server
and the client have different times, the password will be either
invalid already or not yet valid when it arrives.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-1954" /></a>The other way to make traditional,
memorized passwords nonreusable is to use a
<em class="emphasis">challenge-response system</em>. With such a system,
the password you give depends on a prompt that the server gives you.
Challenge-response is the traditional method for identifying yourself
at a speakeasy, entering a military camp, or meeting fellow spies in
art museums. It may seem to be an impractical approach, because in
order to be reasonably safe from playback attacks, you need a wide
variety of challenges, each with a separate response. If you have
trouble remembering one password, you certainly aren't going to
remember 47 of them.</p><p>





In fact, however, challenge-response systems for computers are
designed so that instead of memorizing the response to each
challenge, you memorize a rule for converting the challenge into a
response. This concept has yet to become popular as a pure
"what you know" option because it's difficult to
apply to a large number of people. A rule like "reverse the
first three letters, capitalize the fourth, delete the fifth, and
uppercase the rest of them" is easy to program, but it's
not necessarily easy to represent so that you can have a different
rule for each user. Even if you can remember your own rule,
you're apt to follow along the challenge with a finger,
muttering the rule to yourself while you try to implement it; someone
watching over your shoulder can pretty easily determine the rule.</p><p>





Some systems that present standard password prompts to the user then
use challenge-response systems internally. This is what Windows NT
challenge-response authentication does; the user gets a standard
password prompt and provides a fixed password, but the dialog between
the server and the client uses a challenge-response system.</p><p>





Both Windows NT challenge/response and Kerberos are vulnerable to
password-guessing attacks. If you use this type of system across the
Internet, you will need to have both passwords that are hard to guess
and good auditing systems to catch attempts to guess them. On most
operating systems, including Windows NT and most versions of Unix,
you will need additional software to force users to pick good
passwords.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch21-20394" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.1.3. Something You Have</h3>





In practice, the most successful authentication systems for Internet
use today are based on the third type of authentication:
"something you have". What you have may be a printed list
of single-use passwords or an electronic card; it's usually,
but not always, combined with "something you know".</p><p>





The use of electronic cards makes it practical to use
challenge-response or time-based encryption. For challenge-response,
you encode in the card itself the rule that converts the challenge to
the response. For time-based encryption, you encode in the card both
the time source and the encryption smarts. Either way, you can do
authentication without needing modified clients or users with trick
memories.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1955" /></a>Using
printed lists of passwords is generally referred to as using
<em class="emphasis">one-time passwords</em>. This confuses people because
all nonreusable passwords are good only one time, by definition.
Printed password lists are called that because they resemble a spy
device called a <em class="emphasis">one-time pad</em> that consists of a
pad of paper with different instructions on each page. You encrypt
one message with each page, so that the opposite side doesn't
get multiple chances to break the code.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-131">[131]</a><a name="INDEX-1956" /></a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-131" /></a>[131]In fact,
printed one-time password lists resemble one-time pads so closely
that it's inadvisable to bring one to the attention of a
customs agent when travelling internationally.</p><p>
