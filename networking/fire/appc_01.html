<a name="INDEX-2469" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2470" /></a>Cryptography
is surrounded in myths, politics, and passionate opinions. This
appendix is intended to help you sort them out to the extent
necessary to build a firewall. It is not a complete introduction to
cryptography; instead, it's a rapid tour of the essentials
you'll need to understand the rest of this book. In particular,
we avoid going into details on how cryptographic algorithms actually
work, focusing instead on their general properties. A number of books
focus on cryptography; we particularly recommend Bruce
Schneier's <em class="emphasis">Applied Cryptography</em>, 2nd
edition <em class="emphasis">(</em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1995).</p><p>


This appendix starts by discussing general issues in cryptography,
then describes types of cryptographic algorithms and their uses, and
finishes with some information about specific algorithms.</p><p>



















<div class="sect1"><a name="appc-2-fm2xml" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">C.1. What Are You Protecting and Why?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2471" /></a>For the most part, people use
cryptography to protect information. Sometimes they are trying to
keep something secret; sometimes they are trying to keep something
from being changed; sometimes they are trying to ensure that the
person responsible for something is clearly identifiable. But very
few people use cryptography just for the amusement value.</p><p>





In order to determine what you need from cryptography, you have to
first know what you need to protect and what you're trying to
protect it from. For instance, suppose you are attempting to keep
some piece of information secret. That might be a trivial piece of
information that's going to change again soon (for instance,
what present you picked out for a friend's birthday next week),
or it might be an important piece of information that can be turned
into cash any time in the next several years (for instance, the
number of the credit card you just got). It might be the press
release you're going to make public next week, which commercial
competitors may be actively trying to discover but will be pointless
to conceal as soon as it appears in the newspaper, or it might be
your government's nuclear bomb plans, which professional spies
are actively trying to discover and will still destroy the world no
matter when they're used.</p><p>





Clearly, you're going to want different things from the
algorithms you use to protect these pieces of information. If
you're keeping the birthday present a secret, you want
something that's fast and easy to use; you don't care
much if it's easy to figure out (unless your friend is a
cryptographer who hates surprises). If you're keeping a credit
card number secret, you mostly care about how secure it is, but most
of the time, people won't be trying to find it out. If
you're keeping a press release secret from competitors, you
only need to protect it until you release it; if you're keeping
nuclear bomb plans secret, you need to protect them forever.</p><p>





Similarly, cryptography can be used to prove your identity (this is
discussed later in this appendix). You may use cryptography to prove
who you are when sending a note to a friend, when approving an
expensive purchase at work, or when releasing a piece of software to
the world. These things require different levels of certainty, last
for different amounts of time, and require different kinds of
infrastructure.</p><p>





If you're sending a note to a friend, the friend probably
doesn't need to be all that certain who it's from; if
somebody else pretends to be you, it will probably all get sorted out
in the end, even if a certain amount of comedy or unpleasantness
results. The friend needs to be able to verify your identity only
when the message arrives. If the verification data isn't good
months later, that's OK; the message is probably of purely
sentimental value by then. You and the friend can set up a system
between the two of you for verifying your identity; you don't
need a way that will work on a large scale. Finally, all your friend
needs to know is that the message is from you. Presumably, anybody
you consider a friend already knows who you are and why they want to
read messages from you.</p><p>





If you're authorizing a purchase at work, there are legal
requirements to be fulfilled. Those legal requirements demand a
higher level of certainty. If somebody else pretends to be you, the
company's money is at stake, and the consequences include
prosecution for fraud or incompetence. The legal requirements also
demand that the information be verifiable for a longer period of
time; not only does somebody need to be able to verify your identity
when the purchase is made, they need to be able to verify it again
during a later query or audit. Practical requirements also mean that
there needs to be a consistent company-wide architecture for
verifying your identity. It can't be done differently for every
employee, so an infrastructure of some sort is required. That
infrastructure has to include not only identity data ("This is
how you know it's from Ethelraeda Perkins"), but also
authorization data ("This is how you know Ethelraeda Perkins is
allowed to authorize purchases up to $20,000").</p><p>





If you're releasing software to the Internet, things change
again. If somebody pretends to be you and releases destructive
software in your name, your reputation can be permanently damaged,
and the consequences include things like your name ending up on the
front page of newspapers worldwide. You need a high level of
certainty about identities, and you need that level of certainty for
a long time (one of the authors still periodically receives questions
about relatively obscure software distributed over 10 years ago).
This has to be provided with a worldwide infrastructure, accessible
to everybody you want to distribute software to, and that
infrastructure must provide enough information so that people can
readily tell not only who you are, but why they trust you enough to
run programs you're distributing.<a name="INDEX-2472" /></a></p><p>
