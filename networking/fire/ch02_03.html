<h2 class="sect1">2.3. Electronic Mail and News</h2>





Electronic mail and news provide ways for people to exchange
information with each other without requiring an immediate,
interactive response. <a name="INDEX-102" /><a name="INDEX-103" /><a name="INDEX-104" /></p><p>





<a name="ch02-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.3.1. Electronic Mail</h3>





<a name="INDEX-105" />Electronic
mail is one of the most popular network services. It's
relatively low risk, but that doesn't mean it's
risk-free. Forging electronic mail is trivial (just as is forging
regular postal mail), and forgeries facilitate two different types of
attacks:</p><p>





<ul><li>Attacks against your
reputation<a name="INDEX-106" /></p><p></li><li>Social manipulation attacks (e.g., attacks in which users are sent
mail purporting to come from an administrator and advising them to
change to a specific password) <a name="INDEX-107" />
<a name="INDEX-108" /></p><p></li></ul>
Accepting electronic mail ties up computer time and disk space,
opening you up to denial of service attacks, although with proper
configuration, only the electronic mail service will be denied.
Particularly with modern multimedia mail systems, people can send
electronic mail containing programs that run with insufficient
supervision and may turn out to be Trojan horses (programs that
appear to do something interesting or useful but are actually
concealing hostile operations).<a name="INDEX-109" /></p><p>





Although people worry most about deliberate attacks, in practice, the
most common problems with electronic mail are inadvertent floods
(including chain letters) and people who put entirely inappropriate
confidence in the confidentiality of electronic mail and send
proprietary data via electronic mail across the Internet. However, as
long as users are educated, and the mail service is isolated from
other services so that inadvertent or purposeful denial of service
attacks shut down as little as possible, electronic mail is
reasonably safe.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-110" /><a name="INDEX-111" /><a name="INDEX-112" />Simple
ail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the Internet standard protocol for
sending and receiving electronic mail; mail going between servers on
the Internet almost always uses SMTP, and outgoing mail from clients
to servers often does. SMTP itself is not usually a security problem,
but SMTP servers can be. A program that delivers mail to users often
needs to be able to run as any user that might receive mail. This
gives it broad power and makes it a tempting target for attackers.</p><p>





ail servers, like other programs, have a trade-off between features
and security. You probably do not want to use the same server for
your internal mail exchange and for exchanging mail with the
Internet. Instead, you'll want to use a full-featured server
internally and a highly secure server to speak to the Internet. The
internal server will run the well-known software you're used to
using, while the external server will run specialized software.
Because SMTP is designed to pass mail through multiple servers, this
is easy to configure.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-113" /><a name="INDEX-114" /><a name="INDEX-115" />The
most common SMTP server on Unix is Sendmail. Sendmail has been
exploited in a number of break-ins, including the Internet worm,
which makes people nervous about using it. Many of the available
replacements, however, are not clearly preferable to Sendmail; the
evidence suggests they are less exploited because they are less
popular, not because they are less vulnerable. There are exceptions
in programs designed explicitly for security, like Postfix.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-116" />
<a name="INDEX-117" />The most common SMTP server on Windows NT
is Microsoft Exchange, which has also been exploited in a number of
ways. Microsoft Exchange has had fewer problems with actual break-ins
than Sendmail, but has a troubling reputation for stability problems
with SMTP, resulting in denial of service attacks. Like Sendmail,
icrosoft Exchange is a useful mail server with some specialized
features not available elsewhere, but it is no more suitable than
Sendmail as a secure interface to the Internet. For one thing, it
supports multiple protocols, making it even larger and more complex;
for another, it is a noticeably newer implementation of SMTP.</p><p>





While SMTP is used to exchange electronic mail between servers, users
who are reading electronic mail that has already been delivered to a
mail server do not use SMTP. In some cases, they may be reading the
electronic mail directly on the server, but these days most users
transfer the mail from the server across a network using some
protocol. Across the Internet, the most common protocols for this
purpose are the Post Office Protocol (POP) and the Internet Message
Access Protocol (IMAP). Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes have their
own proprietary protocols as well, which provide more features.
<a name="INDEX-118" />
<a name="INDEX-119" /> <a name="INDEX-120" /></p><p>





POP and IMAP have similar security implications; they both normally
transfer user authentication data and email without encrypting it,
allowing attackers to read the mail and often to get reusable user
credentials. It is relatively easy to configure them to conceal the
user authentication information, and relatively difficult to protect
the email contents. IMAP has more features than POP and
correspondingly more security problems. On the other hand, encryption
is more widely and interoperably available with IMAP than with POP.
The proprietary protocols used by Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes
have even more functionality and are difficult, if not impossible, to
protect adequately across the Internet. (Note that both Microsoft
Exchange and Lotus Notes can use nonproprietary protocols as well;
see <a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Electronic Mail and News"</a>, for more information.)</p><p>

<a name="ch02-874" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.3.2. Usenet News</h3>





<a name="INDEX-121" />
<a name="INDEX-122" />While electronic
mail allows people to communicate, it's most efficient as a way
for one person to send a message to another person, or to a small
list of people interested in a particular topic. Newsgroups are the
Internet counterpart to bulletin boards and are designed for
many-to-many communication. Mailing lists also support many-to-many
communication but much less openly and efficiently, because
there's no easy way to find out about all mailing lists, and
every recipient has his own copy of every message. The largest
discussion mailing lists (i.e., lists where discussions take place
among subscribers, rather than lists used to simply distribute
information or announcements to subscribers) have tens of thousands
of subscribers; the most popular newsgroups have at least hundreds of
thousands. Usenet news is rather like television; there's a lot
going on, most of it has little socially redeeming value, and some of
it is fantastically amusing or informative.</p><p>





The risks of news are much like those of electronic mail: your users
might foolishly trust information received; they might release
confidential information; and you might get flooded. News resembles a
flood when it's functioning normally  --  most sites receive
all the news they can stand every day, and the amount is continuously
increasing  --  so you must make absolutely sure to configure news
so that floods don't affect other services. Because news is
rarely an essential service, denial of service attacks on a single
site are usually just ignored. The security risks of news are
therefore quite low. You might want to avoid news because you
don't have the bandwidth or the disk space to spare, or because
you are worried about the content, but it's not a significant
security problem.</p><p>





These days, a number of web sites allow people to access newsgroups
from a web browser using HTTP. This is not very efficient if a large
number of people are reading news, and it's a poor interface at
best for creating news, but if your site has a small number of people
who need to read news, the most efficient solution may be to use one
of these sites.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-123" /><a name="INDEX-124" />Network News
Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is used to transfer news across the
Internet. In setting up a news server at your site, you'll need
to determine the most secure way for news to flow into your internal
systems so NNTP can't be used to penetrate your system. Some
sites put the news server on the bastion host (described in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>); others on an internal system, as we'll
describe in <a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Electronic Mail and News"</a>. NNTP doesn't do much,
and your external transfers of news will all be with specific other
machines (it's not like mail, which you want to receive from
everybody), so it's not particularly difficult to secure.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-125" />
<a name="INDEX-126" /><a name="INDEX-127" />The biggest security issue
you'll face with news is what to do with private newsgroups.
any sites create private local newsgroups to facilitate discussions
among their users; these private newsgroups often contain sensitive,
confidential, or proprietary information. Someone who can access your
NNTP server can potentially access these private newsgroups,
resulting in disclosure of this information. If you're going to
create private newsgroups, be sure to configure NNTP carefully to
control access to these groups. (Configuring NNTP to work in a
firewall environment is discussed fully in <a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Electronic Mail and News"</a>.)</p><p>
