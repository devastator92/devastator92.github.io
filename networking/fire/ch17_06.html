<h2 class="sect1">17.6. Printing Protocols</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1698" />One
specialized form of file transfer is printing, where you are sending
files to a printer instead of to another general-purpose computer.
Although people tend to think of printing as relatively safe, in
fact, it involves most of the same risks as other file transfer
protocols, and printers have most of the capabilities of other
computing devices.</p><p>





You need to realize that many modern network printing devices respond
to protocols other than the dedicated printing protocols discussed
here. For instance, they may have administrative interfaces that use
Telnet or HTTP; they may auto-configure interfaces with DHCP; they
may accept file transfers via FTP; and they will certainly respond,
not necessarily correctly, to at least some ICMP. These extra
protocols may introduce entirely new classes of vulnerability. For
instance, one plotter has a network interface that not only allows
you to telnet to the plotter, but then allows you to telnet from the
plotter to other hosts. (Apparently, the easiest way to get an
intelligent interface was to simply take it, lock, stock, and barrel,
from a network hub made by the same company --  except that a
network hub can reasonably be expected to do this sort of thing,
while few people suspect a plotter of also having network management
capabilities and a guest login.) You should carefully examine the
network capabilities and protections of printing devices before
putting them on unprotected networks.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1699" />Because modern PostScript printers can be
intelligent Ethernet devices with their own disks, it is
theoretically possible for a rogue print job to turn one into a
network sniffing device. In practice, this is a baroquely complex
approach; attackers aren't very likely to succeed at it.
However, more mundane denial of service attacks on printers are
eminently possible and in fact have been known to happen.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1700" />
<a name="INDEX-1701" /><a name="INDEX-1702" />Some are merely annoying, such as
simply printing page after page of garbage (or, better yet, something
offensive to the victim or the victim's coworkers) until the
printer runs out of paper. But a few of them are serious, and the
nastiest of them are enabled by a security feature in PostScript.
PostScript was designed to protect certain dangerous commands by
requiring a password before they were executed. This password is
stored in an EEPROM chip on the printer and is factory-set to
"0" on every brand of PostScript printer. It's
always the same because it <em class="emphasis">must</em> always be the
same. Some of the commands that the PostScript designers considered
dangerous are routinely used by standard PostScript drivers, and if
you change the password, those drivers will no longer work. Because,
in order to reset it, you need either the old password or a hardware
method to override the EEPROM, a program that uses the well-known
"0" password to reset the password to something unknown
can make printers effectively unusable until new EEPROMs are sent
from the factory. (Some printers will run without the EEPROM, with an
effective password of 0.) Removing or replacing the EEPROM resets not
only the password, but also the printer ID and the page count; if you
have fonts licensed to the printer, they will have to be relicensed.
Since the last wave of such attacks, licensing of fonts to individual
printers has become uncommon, reducing the attack's popularity.
On the other hand, there are likely to be other, equally annoying
PostScript attacks in the future.</p><p>





The intelligence and vulnerability of PostScript devices makes it
important to protect your printers from Internet access. Make sure
you have blocked any remote printing protocols your machines and
printers use. You will need to check every printer type and every
machine type separately.</p><p>





<a name="ch17-16581" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.6.1. lpr and lp</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1703" />The BSD <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>
printing system is very similar to the BSD "r" commands
(<tt class="command">rsh</tt>, <tt class="command">rlogin</tt>,
<tt class="command">rcp</tt>, <tt class="command">rdump</tt>) discussed in <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>. Unlike the "r" commands,
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> authorizes hosts, not individual users, and
it will accept jobs from hosts in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/printers.equiv</em> as well as
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1704" />There have
been a number of security problems with <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> and
its associated printing commands. Some of these are inherent in the
design of <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>, which provides no user
authentication and no data protection. Most of them, however, are
implementation problems, including buffer overflows, printers, and
spooling systems that crash on invalid or dubious input, and ways of
using the printer system's administrative privileges to print
out, overwrite, or delete files that would be otherwise inaccessible.
Several <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> problems give remote attackers the
ability to run any command as root. You should carefully limit access
to <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> print servers and run current versions of
the printing system.</p><p>





The System V <em class="emphasis">lp</em> printing system doesn't
really have a remote printing component. When it does remote
printing, it usually does it by handing the job off to a BSD
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> printing system, or by using the BSD
<em class="emphasis">rsh</em> command (which is often called
<em class="emphasis">remsh</em> on System V systems because such systems
have another program called <em class="emphasis">rsh</em> that does
something else entirely).</p><p>





When jobs are actually printed via <em class="emphasis">lp</em> or
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em>, they are normally run through
printer-specific filters, which translate the user-readable data into
a format the printer will accept. Even when the printing system
itself is secure, the printer filter can introduce new security
problems. If you are accepting print jobs from possibly hostile
sources, you should be extremely careful about the printer filters
that you run and the permissions that they have.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">17.6.1.1. LPRng</h3>





A freely available printing system called LPRng (for
"<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> next generation"), originally
designed by Patrick Powell, addresses a number of the problems with
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em>. It adds support for both authentication and
encryption of printer jobs, while still providing backward
compatibility with <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>. It uses the same ports
as <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch17-16639" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">17.6.1.2. Packet filtering characteristics of lpr</h3>





<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> is TCP-based. Servers use port 515. Clients
use random ports below 1024, just like the BSD "r"
commands (for further information about the BSD "r"
commands, see <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>). For historical reasons,
some clients use ports only between 721 and 731 (this behavior is
documented in the RFC that discusses <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>, but in
practice few servers require it).</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">17.6.1.3. Proxying characteristics of lpr</h3>





<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> is a store-and-forward protocol, capable of
being configured to do its own proxying. You can simply run a
standard <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> configuration on your proxy server
and configure it to drive whatever printers you like or pass jobs to
another server. This does not provide security improvements over
direct <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>, but it will let it cross a
nonrouting host.</p><p>

<a name="ch17-22-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">17.6.1.4. Network address translation characteristics of lpr</h3>





<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> does not use embedded IP addresses and will
work with network address translation systems without problems.
However, print jobs will normally contain information about internal
hostnames.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch17-16769" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">17.6.1.5. Packet filtering and proxying characteristics of lp</h3>





<em class="emphasis">lp</em> itself provides no remote printing support.
It handles printing across the network by using either
<em class="emphasis">rsh</em>, which is covered in with the other 
BSD "r" commands,
or <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>. To determine what your printer
configuration is using, configure a remote printer and read its
interface file (which is usually stored in
<em class="emphasis">/usr/spool/lp/interfaces/printername</em>). Some
vendors also provide novel remote printing systems for use with
<em class="emphasis">lp</em> ; consult your vendor documentation for
information.<a name="INDEX-1705" /></p><p>

<a name="ch17-23-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.6.2. Windows-based Printing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1706" />
<a name="INDEX-1707" />
<a name="INDEX-1708" />Windows
operating systems use three main kinds of network-based printing
protocols. Windows NT and Windows 95 and above are capable of using
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> as a network printing protocol. In addition,
two Windows-native network printing protocols are based on SMB, a
LanMan version (which uses specialized printing calls) and a CIFS
version (which uses a named pipe into the spooler system and general
transaction calls). These protocols have some special security
implications in addition to the general issues with SMB. Most clients
are set so that if a print server claims to have an upgraded version
of a printer driver, the client will accept and run the new software.
This is one of the few cases where a server can actually force a
client to download and run arbitrary code via SMB without a
user's consciously asking for something to be executed. While
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> outbound (from an internal client to an
external print server) is relatively secure, outbound SMB printing is
even less secure than inbound SMB printing.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch17-24-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.6.3. Other Printing Systems</h3>





Given the deficiencies of both <em class="emphasis">lp</em> and
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em>, many Unix vendors implement their own
solutions to remote printing. Other platforms may support
<em class="emphasis">lp</em>, <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>, a separate
protocol, or some combination. Because it has its own protocol, which
is somewhat easier to implement than <em class="emphasis">rsh</em>,
<em class="emphasis">lpr</em> is more popular than <em class="emphasis">lp</em>
on non-Unix systems, but many of them have their own protocols. Some
printers are network devices in their own right, sometimes speaking
<em class="emphasis">lp</em> or <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> directly, and
sometimes (particularly older printers) speaking a protocol developed
by the printer manufacturer.</p><p>





For the most part, the wide variety of other network printing
protocols that are out there share a common feature; they're no
more secure than <em class="emphasis">lpr</em>. Most of them are not even
as secure as <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> (if you can reach the system
with a print request in the right protocol, it will print it).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1709" /> <a name="INDEX-1710" /><a name="INDEX-1711" />The IETF is
working on a protocol called the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP),
which is designed to be used across the Internet. This protocol is
not yet in widespread use, although it is provided with Windows 2000
and is expected to become more popular as Windows 2000 comes into
use. IPP is based on HTTP and may be run on the normal HTTP port or
on port 631. IPP encryption is provided by running it over HTTPS
instead of HTTP. Authentication may be provided either by using HTTPS
with client certificates, or by using any HTTP authentication method.
See <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "The World Wide Web"</a>, for more information about HTTP and
HTTPS.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1712" /> <a name="INDEX-1713" />Hewlett-Packard printers also support a
network printing interface that has become a de facto standard,
although it barely qualifies as a protocol. The printer accepts
printer jobs on TCP port 9100, much the same way it would over a
serial or parallel connection. Each TCP connection is a separate job,
and the printer simply processes the data as it receives it,
returning any error codes. This obviously provides no encryption or
authentication.</p><p>
