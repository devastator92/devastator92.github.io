<h2 class="sect1">22.4. ICMP and Network Diagnostics</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2072" /> <a name="INDEX-2073" />The
ICMP and network diagnostic protocols and programs are mostly used by
network administrators to debug networks. They are the network
administration equivalent of a carpenter's hammer and saw: the
most basic, simple, and critical tools, ancient in design but
nonetheless indispensable.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2074" /> <a name="INDEX-2075" />
<a name="INDEX-2076" />
<a name="INDEX-2077" /> <a name="INDEX-2078" />Because they are widely accepted
low-level protocols, they are also frequently exploited for attacks.
A number of denial of service attacks are based upon malformed ICMP
packets, and a number of Trojan horses use ICMP to send information
out of compromised sites. In addition, forged or inaccurate ICMP
packets are often used as part or all of attacks on systems. For
instance, an attacker can send an ICMP "destination unreachable
packet" for a host that is actually reachable; this will
interfere with communications to the attacked destination.</p><p>





any packet filtering systems let you filter ICMP packets in much the
same way as TCP or UDP packets: by specifying the ICMP message type
code instead of the TCP or UDP source or destination port number. If
your packet filtering system has this capability, its documentation
should include a list of the ICMP numeric codes or keywords that the
packet filtering system understands. You may not want to filter all
ICMP because it will prevent path MTU discovery from functioning, and
this may cause problems (see <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>, for more
information about path MTU discovery).</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2079" /><a name="INDEX-2080" /><a name="INDEX-2081" />The
<em class="emphasis">ping</em><a href="#FOOTNOTE-156">[156]</a> program checks network connectivity. The
<em class="emphasis">ping</em> application generates an ICMP "echo
request" packet. The destination system responds with an ICMP
"echo response" packet. ICMP is typically implemented in
the kernel, so it's the kernel that generates the "echo
response" packet; there is no separate server for ICMP on most
systems. (On some machines, the echo response is actually generated
in the network interface itself, not in the operating system, and the
machine need not even be fully running to respond to
<em class="emphasis">ping</em>.) <em class="emphasis">ping</em> is not the only
program that uses ICMP echo; others include
<em class="emphasis">spray</em> and almost any dedicated network
management tool.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-156" />[156]<em class="emphasis">ping</em>
is not an acronym. Mike Muus, who wrote the original program,
confirms that he named it after the noise sonar makes.</p><p>




</blockquote>





<em class="emphasis">ping</em> is a useful network troubleshooting tool,
and it is reasonably safe. You'll probably want to allow
<em class="emphasis">ping</em> outbound from at least the machines your
network operations staff uses and inbound from at least the network
operations center machines of your network service provider.</p><p>





Because of where it is implemented, it is almost impossible to
disable replies to <em class="emphasis">ping</em> on individual hosts;
packet filtering is the only way to control it.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2082" /><a name="INDEX-2083" />There are multiple dangers in
allowing ICMP echo:</p><p>





<ul><li>It can be used for a denial of service attack -- that is, to flood
your network. Although any protocol you accept can be used in this
way, ICMP echo is particularly tempting because commonly available
programs designed for network testing (including some versions of
<em class="emphasis">ping</em>) let you flood networks with simple
command-line options.</p><p></li><li>Anybody who can send ICMP echo requests to and receive ICMP echo
responses from your network can discover how many machines you have
and what network addresses they're at; this increases the
efficiency of any further attacks. That's why you want to limit
requests to machines that have a legitimate reason to be probing your
network.</p><p></li><li>Malformed ICMP echo requests may have unfortunate effects on weak
implementations of IP. This is true of all protocols, but ICMP is
easily overlooked and therefore tends to have hastily written
implementations that are particularly vulnerable.</p><p></li><li>The data portion of ICMP echo requests and responses are unimportant
to the protocol and may legally contain anything. This makes ICMP
echo a particularly useful way to smuggle information through a
firewall.</p><p></li></ul>

To allow the <em class="emphasis">ping</em> program to operate outbound
(i.e., <em class="emphasis">ping</em>ing remote hosts), you'll have
to allow ICMP echo request packets outbound and ICMP echo response

have to allow ICMP echo request packets inbound and ICMP echo

the acceptable size of ICMP echo request packets. Limiting the
inbound size is a self-protection measure, designed to protect
against denial of service attacks; limiting the outbound size is a
matter of politeness.</p><p>

If you have a stateful packet filtering system, it is wise to
configure it so that you allow responses only if you have seen a
matching request. This is particularly important if you only allow
requests in one direction, since the responses will be going in the
direction where requests are denied. Unsolicited responses are always
hostile, whether they are actual attacks or being used as covert
channels to smuggle information.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">22.4.1.2. Proxying characteristics of ping</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2084" />SOCKS5 provides a modified-client
proxy system for <em class="emphasis">ping</em>. Because
<em class="emphasis">ping</em> is neither TCP- nor UDP-based, it
won't work with most generic proxy servers for modified-client
proxying. Because <em class="emphasis">ping</em> transmits no
user-supplied data to the destination host, modified-procedure
proxying for <em class="emphasis">ping</em> is not possible.
odified-procedure proxying also relies on the ability of the proxy
server to intercept the request before the machine it's running
on generates a reply, which is difficult with
<em class="emphasis">ping</em>. In a pure modified-procedure proxying
environment, <em class="emphasis">ping</em> will have to be provided by
letting users connect to the proxying host (for instance, with a
special web page) and run <em class="emphasis">ping</em> from there, as
discussed in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>. Several systems that use
packet interception to do proxying supply <em class="emphasis">ping</em>
proxies.</p><p>





When proxying <em class="emphasis">ping</em>, it is a good idea to
sanitize the packet bodies. Instead of passing the original data
portion of the response or request, the proxy should replace it with
an equivalent length of data generated by the proxy. This will
prevent the use of <em class="emphasis">ping</em> as a covert channel. In
a few cases, it will also interfere with debugging (some network
problems are dependent on particular data patterns triggering bugs in
networking hardware). Fortunately, this kind of debugging rarely
needs to cross the Internet.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.4.2. traceroute</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2086" /><a name="INDEX-2087" /><a name="INDEX-2088" /><em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> (also known
as <em class="emphasis">tracert</em> on Microsoft systems) is an
application that shows you the route that packets take to a
particular IP destination. Because no system typically knows the full
path to the destination (merely the next step towards the
destination), this is a neat trick.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-158">[158]</a>
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> works by carefully constructing
special packets. The destination address of the packets is the remote
host; depending on the implementation, the packets are either ICMP
echo packets or UDP packets where the destination port is an unused
(or so we hope, as we'll discuss later) port on the remote
host. The really special thing about the packets, though, is that the
time to live (TTL) fields are set very low (starting at 1), so that
the packets will be rejected by intermediate routers as if they were
looping in the network. By looking where the rejections (ICMP
"time to live exceeded" messages) come from,
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> can determine who the intermediate
routers are.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-158" />[158]<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> is, fundamentally, a
"cool hack".</p><p>




</blockquote>





TTL is a field in the header of every IP packet. It normally
isn't of interest from a firewall point of view. The name is
somewhat misleading; it might be more intuitively called "hops
to live". When a packet is first created, its TTL field is set
to some value (typically 16, 30, or 255). Every router that handles
the packet along its journey decrements the TTL field by 1. If the
TTL field ever reaches 0, the packet is assumed to be in some sort of
a loop; it is encapsulated within an ICMP "time to live
exceeded" message and is returned to the source address.</p><p>





Thus, the first router that handles the first of
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>'s specially constructed packets
(which has a TTL of 1) will decrement the TTL field, see that
it's 0, and return an ICMP "time to live exceeded"
message, telling <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> the IP address of
the first router (the IP source address in the ICMP message).</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> then constructs another packet, this
time with a TTL of 2, and sends it out. This packet gets to the
second router before TTL gets decremented to 0, and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> knows that the router that returns
the ICMP "time to live exceeded" for that packet is the
second router along the path to the destination.
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> then constructs a packet with a TTL
of 3, then 4, and so on, to determine the path to the destination.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> knows it's finished when it
gets back an ICMP "echo reply" or ICMP "destination
unreachable" message, rather than an ICMP "time to live
exceeded" message from some intermediate router.</p><p>





ost versions of <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> will also note and
display relevant ICMP "host unreachable", "network
unreachable", and other ICMP messages received.</p><p>





If <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> can't reach the destination
host (or can't get anything back from it), it eventually times
out.</p><p>





<a name="ch22-15537" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.4.2.1. Packet filtering characteristics of traceroute</h3>





To allow <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> outbound through your packet
filters (i.e., someone running <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> from
the inside, to an external destination), you have to allow the
constructed UDP or ICMP packets outbound, and the relevant ICMP
response packets inbound (particularly "time to live
exceeded" and "destination unreachable").</p><p>





To allow <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> inbound, you have to allow
the constructed UDP or ICMP packets inbound, and the relevant ICMP
messages back outbound. You may wish to limit this capability to the
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> machines used by the network
operations center of your network service provider, in order to keep
a tight rein on the UDP packets allowed through your firewall.
Limiting UDP protects RPC-based services (like NFS and NIS) and keeps
attackers from using <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> to discover
which addresses at your site are actually assigned to hosts. The
issues with ICMP echo, and the characteristics of echo and echo reply
packets, are discussed earlier in the section about
<em class="emphasis">ping</em>.</p><p>





Some versions of <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> that use UDP can be
told (via a command-line or a compile-time option) which range of UDP
ports to use for the destination. You may need to establish a
convention for your site of what port(s) will be allowed through the
packet filters for use by <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>. You
don't want to allow any more latitude in your packet filters
for <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> than absolutely necessary
(particularly for incoming <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>). Because
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> is UDP-based, an attacker could
potentially take advantage of the UDP-based rules in your packet
filtering that are there to allow <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> in
order to attack other UDP-based services like NFS and NIS.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.4.3. Other ICMP Packets</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2090" /><a name="INDEX-2091" />A
number of ICMP message types used for network management don't
have programs associated with them. These are automatically generated
and interpreted by various programs and network devices.</p><p>





ICMP message types may also have codes, which contain more
information. For instance, there are a number of codes under
"destination unreachable", including "service
unavailable", "communication administratively
prohibited", and "fragmentation required and Don't
Fragment set". In most cases, the codes within
"destination unreachable" are the only ones of interest;
none of the other widely used ICMP types actually use codes this way</p><p>





What to do with ICMP messages depends on the message and the
direction it's going in. We've already talked about
"echo request", "echo reply",
"destination unreachable", and "time to live
exceeded" messages. The other ICMP message types you probably
want to allow, both inbound and outbound, are "source
quench" (used by a receiver to tell a sender to "slow
down" because it's sending data too fast) and
"parameter problem" (which is sort of a catch-all code to
return when a problem with packet headers can't be reported any
other way).</p><p>





any other ICMP message types have the potential to change local
information on your hosts (for example, "redirect" causes
changes to a host's routing tables), so you probably
don't want to allow such messages inbound through your packet
filters.</p><p>





Even "destination unreachable" can be problematic. Some
attackers send out false "destination unreachable"
messages, which may cause hosts to cut off communications in
progress. (This is a popular attack against people using IRC.) There
is no way to tell a valid "destination unreachable" from
an invalid one, in general, because a "destination
unreachable" can be sent by any machine in the path between the
two hosts. However, most "destination unreachable"
messages can legitimately be sent only at the beginning of a
connection, and it is reasonable for hosts to ignore
"destination unreachable" messages that are not plausible
responses to packets that have been sent.</p><p>





In general, you want to allow ICMP outbound only when it has the
chance of doing you some good. Both "source quench" and
"parameter problem" are used to get the sending host to
be nicer to you and are worth allowing outbound. Any of the ICMP
types that indicate that the connection can't be made
("destination unavailable", "network
unavailable", "service unavailable",
"destination administratively unavailable", or
"network administratively unavailable", for example) will
help an attacker probe your network without giving you much benefit,
and you may want to block these outbound.</p><p>





There are two exceptions to this rule. First, you may find it
expedient to return some sort of error (either an ICMP error or a TCP
reset) to Auth<a href="#FOOTNOTE-161">[161]</a> queries if you are not going to
allow them, in order to speed up mail transmission. This is discussed
further in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>. Second, you will want to
return "fragmentation required and Don't Fragment
set" from any host that can be directly reached with TCP from
the Internet, in order to support path MTU discovery. This is
discussed further in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>. In both these
cases, the rules that you really want to implement are impossible to
specify on most packet filtering systems; they don't allow you
to specify that an ICMP type is allowable only in response to a
specific port, or to specify specific codes within a type. You may be
able to use other workarounds discussed in the detail sections on
these issues.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">

<ul><li>Allow ICMP echo requests outbound but limit incoming ICMP echo
requests to those that are coming from machines with a legitimate
need to probe your network (such as your network service
provider's network operations center) and are bound to hosts
known to have hardened network stacks. Allow ICMP echo responses
either way, but only if they match recent requests.</p><p></li><li>Allow <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> outbound, but limit incoming
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> requests to those coming from
machines with a legitimate need to probe your network and limit the
port range used.</p><p></li><li>Look for a router that will allow you to sanity-check ICMP packets,
and reject obviously malformed or malicious packets regardless of
their source and destination.</p><p></li><li>Allow only safe ICMP message types, as described
previously.<a name="INDEX-2092" /><a name="INDEX-2093" /> <a name="INDEX-2094" /></p><p></li></ul>
