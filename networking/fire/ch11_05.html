<a name="INDEX-998" /><a name="INDEX-999" /><a name="INDEX-1000" />Now it's time to move the
machine from the configuration that was useful to you when you were
building it to the best configuration for running it. You'll
need to do several things:</p><p>





<ol><li>Reconfigure and rebuild the kernel.</p><p></li><li>Remove all nonessential programs.</p></li><li><p>Mount as many filesystems as possible as read-only.</p></li></ol>
<a name="ch11-3674" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.5.1. Reconfigure and Rebuild the Kernel </h3>





<a name="INDEX-1001" /><a name="INDEX-1002" /><a name="INDEX-1003" />The
first step in this phase of building your bastion host is to rebuild
the operating system kernel to remove kernel capabilities you
don't need. This may sound intimidating, but it's
generally a relatively straightforward operation; it needs to be,
because you'll be using the same capabilities you'd use
to install a new type of device on your system. Every Unix system, as
shipped, contains some form of configuration support (they range
considerably in how kernel reconfiguration is supported and in what
you can do). Besides reducing the size of your kernel (and thereby
making more memory available for other purposes), rebuilding the
kernel denies to attackers the chance to exploit these capabilities.</p><p>





Some capabilities are particularly dangerous. In particular, you
should probably remove the following capabilities or device drivers:</p><p>





<ul><li>NFS and related capabilities</p><p></li><li>Anything that enables network sniffing -- for example, Network
Interface Tap (NIT) or Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)</p><p></li></ul>
Although NIT and BPF are provided for testing and debugging purposes,
they are frequently used by attackers. NIT and BPF are dangerous
because they let the machine grab all packets off the Ethernet
it's attached to, instead of only the packets addressed to it.
Disabling these capabilities may prevent you from using the machine
as a packet filtering system, so you may not be able to delete them
in all architectures.</p><p>





If your bastion host is a dual-homed host, this is the time to
disable IP forwarding.</p><p>





You have to be more careful when you disable kernel capabilities than
when you disable services started by <em class="emphasis">inetd</em> or at
boot time from the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em> files (as described
earlier). There are a lot of interdependencies between kernel
capabilities. For this reason, it's sometimes hard to determine
exactly what a given capability is used for. The consequences of
disabling a capability that is actually needed can be
severe -- for example, the new kernel might not boot.</p><p>





ake sure you follow your vendor's instructions for building
and installing new kernels. Always keep a backup copy of your old
kernel. If you have a backup, you can boot from it if you find out
that something is wrong with the new kernel. Some boot systems need
all the kernels to reside in the same partition, or they may need to
be configured with the names of all the kernels you wish to boot.
Either way, be sure that you have a backup kernel, that it's
possible to boot that kernel, and that you know how to do so, all
before you change the working kernel.</p><p>





When you know you can safely reboot the machine, go through the
kernel configuration files the same way you went through the startup
files, checking every single line to make certain that it's
something you want. Again, watch for places where one configuration
file contains another, and check your documentation to be sure that
you've looked at all the configuration files that are
consulted. Often there is one file for including device drivers and
one or more for parameters; IP forwarding will be in the latter.</p><p>





Once you've got a working kernel, you'll probably want to
delete or encrypt your old "full function" kernel.
Replace it with a backup copy of the working minimal kernel. Doing so
will keep an attacker who somehow manages to break into your machine
from simply using that old kernel to reboot, and thereby restore all
of the services you so carefully disabled. For similar reasons,
you'll probably also want to delete the files and programs
needed to build a new kernel.</p><p>





If your kernel uses loadable modules, it may be difficult to
determine when they're used. You will want to delete or encrypt
all the ones that you don't want used, but because
they're not always explicitly loaded, you may not know which
those are. Keeping an alternate boot medium handy, try moving them
out of the directory for loadable modules. Run the machine through
its paces before you finally remove or encrypt them.</p><p>





Beware! Your vendor may have provided copies of "generic"
kernels (which typically have every possible capability enabled) in
unexpected locations for use during the installation of the machine
and its (nonexistent) client machines. Poke around in all the
directories where installation files are kept and all the directories
for clients. The documentation generally tells you where client
kernels are but rarely tells you about the internals of the install
process. Check the documentation for disaster recovery advice, which
may helpfully tell you where to locate spare kernel images.<a name="INDEX-1004" /><a name="INDEX-1005" /><a name="INDEX-1006" /></p><p>

<a name="ch11-3715" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.5.2. Remove Nonessential Programs</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1007" />The next step is to remove all of
the programs that aren't essential for day-to-day operation. If
a program isn't there, an attacker can't exploit any bugs
that it might contain. This is especially true for
<em class="emphasis">setuid/setgid</em> programs, which are a very
tempting target for an attacker. You should remove programs you
normally think of as being essential. Remember that the bastion host
is purely providing Internet services; it does not need to be a
comfortable environment in which to work.</p><p>





Window systems and compilers are examples of major programs you can
get rid of. Attackers find these programs very useful: window systems
are fertile ground for security problems, and compilers can be used
to build the attacker's own tools. Graphical system
administration programs are also usually powerful, vulnerable, and
frequently unnecessary; however, on some platforms, they may be
impossible to remove. Documentation and help systems (including
manual pages) are at best an education for attackers, and at worst
another source of vulnerabilities. Attackers have been known to hide
programs and files among manual pages. Make sure that you have the
information internally, but remove it from all bastion hosts.</p><p>





Before deleting programs like compilers, make sure you've
finished using them yourself; make sure you've built,
installed, and tested everything you're going to need on this
machine, such as the tools for auditing the system (discussed in <a href="ch11_06.html#ch11-3775">Section 11.6, "Running a Security Audit"</a>, later in this chapter).</p><p>





Instead of simply deleting key tools you'd expect an attacker
to use, such as the compiler, you might want to replace them with
programs that raise an alarm (for example, sending electronic mail or
tripping your pager) when someone tries to run them. You might even
want to have the programs halt the system after raising the alarm, if
you believe it's better for the machine to be down than under
attack. This is a prime way to humiliate yourself, however; you
yourself are probably the one person most likely to forget where you
are when you try to run a forbidden command. It's also a good
way to set yourself up for denial of service attacks.</p><p>





You'll want to do two scans looking for things to delete:</p><p>





<ol><li>Walk through all the standard directories for binaries on your system
(everything that's in root's path or in the default user
path). If you're unsure whether a program is needed, turn off
execute permission on it for a while (a few days) before you remove
or encrypt it and see what happens. You may also want to run the
machine for a while before you do the scan and check the access times
on files to see if they've been used.</p><p></li><li>Use <em class="emphasis">find</em> to look for every file on the system
that has the <em class="emphasis">setuid</em> or
<em class="emphasis">setgid</em> bit turned on. The arguments to
<em class="emphasis">find</em> differ radically from system to system, but
you will probably want something like this:</p><p></li></ol>
<blockquote><pre class="code">find / -type f \( -perm -04000 -o -perm -02000 \) -ls</pre></blockquote>




<ol><li>Some versions of <em class="emphasis">find</em> provide special primitives
for identifying <em class="emphasis">setuid</em> and
<em class="emphasis">setgid</em> files.</p><p></li></ol>
If your operating system provides a list of installed packages,
you'll also want to look at that list, which may include things
that have been stashed in interesting places.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">11.5.3. Mount Filesystems as Read-Only</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1008" />
<a name="INDEX-1009" /> <a name="INDEX-1010" /><a name="INDEX-1011" />Once you've configured a
bastion host, you don't want it to change, so you should mount
as many filesystems as possible as read-only. How much of the machine
you can protect this way will depend on the version of Unix that
you're running and the services that you're providing. A
machine that you're using as a packet filtering router may be
able to run with all of its disk space protected; a machine
that's providing mail service will need space to keep temporary
files in, if nothing else.</p><p>





On a service host, you have to provide a certain amount of writable
filesystem space for things like scratch space, system logs, and the
mail spool. You might be able to use a RAM disk for this; however,
you'll have to be sure that your operating system supports it,
that you have enough RAM, and that you think you can afford to lose
the contents of the RAM disk (for example, email in transit between
internal hosts and the Internet) whenever your machine reboots.</p><p>





With most versions of Unix, you'll also have to either provide
writable disk space for memory swapping or turn off swapping. Many
versions of Unix do not allow you to turn off swapping; however, they
will usually allow you to use a separate disk for swap space, and
that disk can safely be left writable. Using a RAM disk will increase
your memory usage to the point where you will probably need swap
space.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1012" />Systems based on BSD 4.4-Lite (for
instance, current releases of NetBSD, FreeBSD, and the BSDI product)
have a new immutable attribute that can be set on a per-file basis.
If a file is marked "immutable", the file cannot be
changed, not even by root, unless the system is running in
single-user mode. If your operating system provides this capability,
use it to protect your programs and configuration files from
tampering by an attacker. (We recommend this approach only if you
cannot use hardware write protection, or as an additional layer of
security to use with hardware write protection. Because it's
implemented in software, it is more likely to be
compromisable.)<a name="INDEX-1013" /> <a name="INDEX-1014" /><a name="INDEX-1015" /><a name="INDEX-1016" /><a name="INDEX-1017" /> <a name="INDEX-1018" /></p><p>
