<a name="INDEX-73" /></a>

In <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "Why Internet Firewalls?"</a>, we discussed,
in general terms, what you're trying to protect when you
connect to the Internet: your data, your resources, and your
reputation. In designing an Internet firewall, your concerns are more
specific: what you need to protect are those services you're
going to use or provide over the Internet.</p><p>


There are a number of standard Internet services that users want and
that most sites try to support. There are important reasons to use
these services; indeed, without them, there is little reason to be
connected to the Internet at all. But there are also potential
security problems with each of them.</p><p>


What services do you want to support at your site? Which ones can you
support securely? Every site is different. Every site has its own
security policy and its own working environment. For example, do all
your users need electronic mail? Do they all need to transfer files
to sites outside your organization? How about downloading files from
sites outside the organization's own network? What information
do you need to make available to the public on the Web? What sort of
control do you want over web browsing from within your site? Who
should be able to log in remotely from another location over the
Internet?</p><p>





This chapter briefly summarizes the major Internet services your
users may be interested in using. It provides only a high-level
summary (details are given in later chapters). None of these services
are really secure; each one has its own security weaknesses, and each
has been exploited in various ways by attackers. Before you decide to
support a service at your site, you will have to assess how important
it is to your users and whether you will be able to protect them from
its dangers. There are various ways of doing this: running the
services only on certain protected machines; using especially secure
variants of the standard services; or, in some cases, blocking the
services completely to or from some or all outside systems.</p><p>





This chapter doesn't list every Internet service  --  it
can't. Such a list would be incomplete as soon as it was
finished and would include services of interest only to a few sites
in the world. Instead, we attempt to list the major services, and we
hope this book will give you the background you need to make
decisions about new services as you encounter them.</p><p>





anagers and system administrators together need to decide which
services to support at your site and to what extent. This is a
continuous process; you will change your decisions as new services
become available and as your needs change. These decisions are the
single most important factor in determining how secure your site will
be, much more important than the precise type of technology you use
in implementing them. No firewall can protect you from things you
have explicitly chosen to allow through it.</p><p>





<a name="ch02-658" /></a><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Getting Started with Internet Services</h4>





Are you just getting connected? Or, have you been connected for a
while but are getting concerned about Internet security? Where should
you start? Many system administrators try to be too ambitious. If you
attempt to develop and deploy the be-all and end-all of firewall
systems right from day one, you probably aren't going to
succeed. The field is just too complex, and the technology is
changing so fast that it will change out from under you before you
get such an endeavor "finished".</p><p>





Start small. At many sites, it boils down to five basic services. If
you can provide these services securely, most of your users will be
satisfied, at least for a while.</p><p>





<ul><li>World Wide Web access (HTTP).</p><p></li><li>Electronic mail (SMTP).<p></p></li><li><p>File transfer (FTP).</p></li><li><p>Remote terminal access (Telnet or preferably SSH).</p></li><li><p>Hostname/address lookup (DNS): Users generally don't use this
service directly, but it underlies the other four services by
translating Internet hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa.</p><p></li></ul>
All five of these services can be safely provided in a number of
different ways, including packet filtering and proxies  -- 
firewall approaches discussed in <a href="part2.html">Part II, "Building Firewalls"</a> of this book. Providing
these services lets your users access most Internet resources, and it
buys you time to figure out how to provide the rest of the services
they'll be asking for soon.</p><p>

<h2 class="sect1">2.1. Secure Services and Safe Services</h2>





You will occasionally hear people talk about "secure
services". They are referring to services that give two kinds
of guarantees:</p><p>





<ol><li>The service cannot be used for anything but its intended purpose,
and/or</p><p></li><li>Other people can't read or falsify transactions with the
service.</p><p></li></ol>
That doesn't actually mean that you can use the service to do
anything whatsoever and still be safe. For instance, you can use
Secure HTTP to download a file, and be sure that you are downloading
exactly the file that the site intended you to download, and that
nobody else has read it on the way past. But you have no guarantee
that the file doesn't contain a virus or an evil program. Maybe
the site is run by somebody nasty.</p><p>





It is also possible to use "insecure" services in secure
ways -- it just has to be done with more caution. For instance,
electronic mail over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a
classic example of an "insecure" service. However, if you
carefully configure your mail servers and encrypt message bodies, you
can achieve the goals mentioned previously. (This still won't
save you if somebody mails you an evil program and you run it!)</p><p>





Similarly, chain saws are extremely unsafe objects, but people still
use them regularly with appropriate precautions and very little risk.
Plastic bags are really quite safe objects, but you can still hurt
yourself with one in a variety of ways, ranging from putting it over
your head and suffocating, to slipping on one on the stairs and
breaking your leg. When you evaluate the security of a service, you
should be sure that you're thinking of its security
implications to your environment in your intended
configurations -- whether or not it's "secure"
or "safe" in the abstract is not of any great interest.
For further information about evaluating services and their security,
see <a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, "Internet Services and Firewalls"</a>.</p><p>
