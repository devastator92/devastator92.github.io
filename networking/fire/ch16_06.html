<h2 class="sect1">16.6. Post Office Protocol (POP)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1599" />SMTP is used to exchange
mail between servers. Sometimes, users access their mail as a file
(directly, or using NFS or something similar) on the machine where it
is delivered; however, there are often reasons to use a separate
protocol to distribute mail from a server to an individual user.</p><p>





POP is a client/server protocol for handling user electronic
mailboxes. With POP, a user's mail spool (the actual file where
that user's incoming email is held for later access) is kept on
a server, rather than on the user's personal machine. The
server is probably available to accept incoming mail more
consistently than the user's personal machine is (particularly
if the user's "personal machine" is a portable that
is only sometimes connected to the network). Clients like Eudora,
Z-Mail, or Netscape use POP to transfer the mail to the personal
machine when the user wants it.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1600" />Two major security issues are involved in
using POP across the Internet. First, be aware that standard POP
clients and servers send the user's POP password over the
Internet in the clear, so that anyone snooping on the connection can
capture and reuse it later. In most cases, the POP password is the
same as the user's login password, so that someone who snoops
on it can get all of the user's privileges  --  not just the
user's electronic mail. More secure variants of
POP<a name="INDEX-1601" /><a name="INDEX-1602" />
<a name="INDEX-1603" /><a name="INDEX-1604" /> support Kerberos (called KPOP) and a
challenge-response system for authentication (called APOP), but these
secure variants are not widely available or widely supported. You may
have trouble finding a combination of clients and servers that
supports these variants and that works for your site.</p><p>





Second, regardless of the authentication issues, be sure to also
consider the sensitivity of the email your users will be accessing
over the Internet via POP. Whatever email your users access will be
visible to anyone snooping on their POP sessions; you need to think
about how sensitive email might be in your own environment. Many
sites decide that, regardless of the authentication issues, their
users' internal email is often too sensitive to risk being
snooped on by someone monitoring their POP sessions. These sites
decide to provide alternative access methods, such as dial-ups, that
aren't as susceptible to snooping. If you provide your users
with the ability to reach your network on the inside of the firewall
(for example, using a VPN or with modems and PPP), you can give them
POP access while they're traveling without allowing it to be
snooped on the Internet.</p><p>





Two different processes are being used to provide protection for POP.
Currently, some servers and clients support the use of POP over SSL,
encrypting the entire connection (this is sometimes called
SecurePOP). This is an effective stopgap measure, but it requires the
use of another port for POP over SSL. (SSL and TLS are discussed in
<a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.)</p><p>





There is also a standard in progress that extends the POP protocol to
allow clients and servers to negotiate the use of TLS on a normal POP
connection. This is the preferred method for providing encryption for
services, since it doesn't require a new port, and the supply
of port numbers is limited. Unfortunately, the standard is not yet
complete and support for it is not widespread.</p><p>





<a name="ch16-8253" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.6.1. Packet Filtering Characteristics of POP</h3>





POP is a TCP-based service. POP servers for the current version of
the POP protocol (which is known as POP3 and is by far the most
common version in use) use port 110. Servers for the older POP2
protocol use port 109. (POP1 was never in widespread use.) POP
clients use ports above 1023. Servers providing POP3 over SSL use
port 995.</p><p>

An outgoing POP connection would allow your users to download their
mail from other sites. This is no more dangerous than allowing
outgoing Telnet, and you will probably want to allow such a POP
connection if there is any demand.</p><p>





Incoming POP connections are those that allow people at other sites
to read mail delivered for them at your site. As discussed in the
previous section, you probably don't want to allow incoming
POP. If you do, you should certainly limit POP connections to a POP
server running on a single host. There have been several problems
with buffer overflows in POP servers, and if any new ones are found,
you would like to be able to patch them on just one host, without
worrying about all your internal hosts. This is easiest if you run
POP on a dedicated bastion host.</p><p>





You will also want to be sure that POP servers that serve incoming
connections are configured so that POP does not use user accounts for
authentication. Some POP servers use normal user accounts to
authenticate connections. Since the POP server is a bastion host, you
don't want users to be able to log in to it, particularly from
the Internet. You should either use a POP server that supports an
alternate source of authentication, or disable logins on the accounts
that POP uses.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.6.2. Proxying Characteristics of POP</h3>





POP is straightforward to proxy because it uses a single connection.
ost commercial proxy systems include POP support. Many of the web
browsers that also provide an email client support POP and will use
SOCKS with POP. (Netscape Communicator and Microsoft's Outlook
both support POP through SOCKS.) The older dedicated email clients
are less likely to have SOCKS support.</p><p>





Two POP proxies are available as add-ons to the TIS-FWTK.
<em class="emphasis">pop-gw</em> is an inbound proxy for POP3.
<em class="emphasis">pop3-gw</em> will do inbound or outbound proxying.
For inbound proxying, you can configure it to run as a pass-through,
passing all connections to a specific internal server. For outbound
use, it uses modified procedures; the user specifies
<em class="emphasis">user@server[:port]</em> as his or her username and
connects to the proxy server. The proxy server will use APOP to speak
to the real server if it is available and may be configured to refuse
connections if APOP is not available; this will keep you from passing
reusable passwords around via the proxy. Note that all data will
still be transmitted unencrypted and will be interceptable.</p><p>

<ul><li>Do not allow your users to transfer your site's mail over the

sensitivity of the mail itself or you have an encrypted channel to
transfer it over.</p><p></li><li>If you have users who wish to transfer mail from other sites via POP,
