<h2 class="sect1">8.10. Where to Do Packet Filtering</h2>





<a name="INDEX-642" /><a name="INDEX-643" /><a name="INDEX-644" />If
you look at the various firewall architectures outlined in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Firewall Architectures"</a>, you see that you might perform packet
filtering in a variety of places. Where should you do it? The answer
is simple: anywhere you can.</p><p>





any of the architectures (e.g., the screened host architecture or
the single-router screened subnet architecture) involve only one
router. In those cases, that one router is the only place where you
could do packet filtering, so there's not much of a decision to
be made.</p><p>





However, other architectures, such as the two-router screened subnet
architecture, and some of the architectural variations, involve
multiple routers. You might do packet filtering on any or all of
these routers.</p><p>





Our recommendation is to do whatever packet filtering you can
wherever you can. This is an application of the principle of least
privilege (described in <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Security Strategies"</a>). For each router
that is part of your firewall, figure out what types of packets
should legitimately be flowing through it, and set up filters to
allow only those packets and no more. You may also want to put packet
filters on destination hosts, using a host-based packet filtering
system like the ones discussed previously, or using special-purpose
software designed for filtering on destination hosts.This is highly
advisable for bastion hosts, and destination host filtering packages
are discussed further in the chapters about bastion hosts (<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Windows NT and Windows 2000 Bastion Hosts "</a>).</p><p>





This may lead to duplication of some filters on multiple routers; in
other words, you may filter out the same thing in more than one
place. That's good; it's redundancy, and it may save you
some day if you ever have a problem with one of your routers  -- 
for example, if something was supposed to be done but wasn't
(because of improper configuration, bugs, enemy action, or whatever).
It provides defense in depth and gives you the opportunity to fail
safely  --  other strategies we outlined in <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Security Strategies"</a>.</p><p>





If filtering is such a good idea, why not filter on all routers, not
just those that are part of the firewall? Basically, because of
performance and maintenance issues. Earlier in this chapter, we
discussed what "fast enough" means for a packet filtering
system on the perimeter of your network. However, what's fast
enough at the edge of your network (where the real bottleneck is
probably the speed of the line connecting you to the Internet) is
probably not fast enough within your network (where you've
probably got many busy local area networks of Ethernet, FDDI, or
perhaps something even faster). Further, if you put filters on all
your routers, you're going to have to maintain all those filter
lists. Maintaining filter lists is a manageable problem if
you're talking about one or a handful of routers that are part
of a firewall, but it gets out of hand in a hurry as the number of
routers increases. This problem is worsened if some of the routers
are purely internal. Why? Because you probably want to allow more
services within your network than you allow between your network and
the Internet. This is going to either make your filter sets longer
(and thus harder to maintain), or make you switch from a
"default deny" stance to a "default permit"
stance on those internal filters (which is going to seriously
undermine the security they provide anyway). You reach a point of
diminishing returns fairly quickly when you try to apply filtering
widely within a local area network, rather than just at its
perimeter.</p><p>





You may still have internal packet filtering routers at boundaries
within the local area network (between networks with different
security policies, or networks that belong to different
organizations). As long as they're at clearly defined
boundaries, and they're up to the performance requirements,
that's not a problem. Whether or not you duplicate the external
rules on these internal packet filters is going to depend on how much
you trust the external packet filters, and how much complexity and
overhead the external rules are going to add.</p><p>





In some cases, you may also be able to run packet filtering packages
on bastion hosts. If this is not a performance problem, it can
provide additional security in the event that a packet filtering
router is compromised or misconfigured.</p><p>





Some people argue against putting packet filters on routers when you
also have a firewall inside the router, on the grounds that allowing
packets to reach the firewall system gives you a single logging
point, making it easier to detect attacks. If an attack involves some
packets that are filtered out at the router, and others that are
rejected at an internal firewall, the internal firewall may not be
successful at detecting the attack. This is not a convincing
argument; the internal firewall will still be successful at detecting
any attack that has any chance of succeeding against it, and any
reasonable logging configuration will let you correlate the logs from
the packet filters with the logs from the internal firewall and do
intrusion detection on the union of them in any case. The increased
detection benefit from allowing the packets is more than outweighed
by the decrease in security.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-21">[21]</a> <a name="INDEX-645" /> <a name="INDEX-646" /> <a name="INDEX-647" /></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-21" />[21]We have also heard the
argument that "the firewall is more secure than the packet
filter, so you should use it instead." This is relevant only if
you can't use both at the same time. Clearly, the firewall is
not more secure than the combination of the firewall and the packet
filter!</p><p>
