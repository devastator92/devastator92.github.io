<a name="INDEX-397" /></a><a name="INDEX-398" /></a>This chapter describes a variety of ways to
put firewall components together, and discusses their advantages and
disadvantages. We'll tell you what some appropriate uses are
for each architecture.</p><p>



















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch06-38463" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">6.1. Single-Box Architectures</h2>





The simplest firewall architectures have a single object that acts as
the firewall. In general, the security advantage of
<em class="emphasis">single-box architectures</em> is that they provide a
single place that you can concentrate on and be sure that you have
correctly configured, while the disadvantage is that your security is
entirely dependent on a single place. There is no defense in depth,
but on the other hand, you know exactly what your weakest link is and
how weak it is, which is much harder with multiple layers.</p><p>





In practice, the advantages of single-box architectures are not in
their security but in other practical concerns. Compared to a
multiple-layer system that's integrated with your network, a
single-box architecture is cheaper, easier to understand and explain
to management, and easier to get from an external vendor. This makes
it the solution of choice for small sites. It also makes it a
tempting solution for people who are looking for magic security
solutions that can be put in once and forgotten about. While there
are very good single-box firewalls, there are no magic firewalls, and
single-box solutions require the same difficult decisions, careful
configuration, and ongoing maintenance that all other firewalls do.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-2-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.1. Screening Router</h3>





<a name="INDEX-399" /></a>It is possible to use a packet filtering
system by itself as a firewall, as shown in <a href="ch06_01.html#ch06-17898">Figure 6-1</a>, using just a  <em class="emphasis">screening
router</em> to protect an entire network. This is a low-cost
system, since you almost always need a router to connect to the
Internet anyway, and you can simply configure packet filtering in
that router. On the other hand, it's not very flexible; you can
permit or deny protocols by port number, but it's hard to allow
some operations while denying others in the same protocol, or to be
sure that what's coming in on a given port is actually the
protocol you wanted to allow. In addition, it gives you no depth of
defense. If the router is compromised, you have no further security.</p><p>

<a name="ch06-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.1.1.1. Appropriate uses</h3>





A screening router is an appropriate firewall for a situation where:</p><p>





<ul><li>The network being protected already has a high level of host security.</p><p></li><li>The number of protocols being used is limited, and the protocols
themselves are straightforward.</p><p></li><li>You require maximum performance and redundancy.<p></p></li></ul>
Screening routers are most useful for internal firewalls and for
networks that are dedicated to providing services to the Internet.
It's not uncommon for Internet service providers to use nothing
but a screening router between their service hosts and the Internet,
for instance.<a name="INDEX-400" /></a></p><p>

<a name="ch06-1849" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.2. Dual-Homed Host </h3>





<a name="INDEX-401" /></a>A
<em class="emphasis">dual-homed host architecture</em> is built around the
dual-homed host computer, a computer that has at least two network
interfaces. Such a host could act as a router between the networks
these interfaces are attached to; it is capable of routing IP packets
from one network to another. However, to use a dual-homed host as a
firewall, you disable this routing function. Thus, IP packets from
one network (e.g., the Internet) are not directly routed to the other
network (e.g., the internal, protected network). Systems inside the
firewall can communicate with the dual-homed host, and systems
outside the firewall (on the Internet) can communicate with the
dual-homed host, but these systems can't communicate directly
with each other. IP traffic between them is completely blocked.</p><p>





Some variations on the dual-homed host architecture use IP to the
Internet and some other network protocol (for instance, NetBEUI) on
the internal network. This helps to enforce the separation between
the two networks, making it less likely that host misconfigurations
will let traffic slip from one interface to another, and also
reducing the chance that if this does happen there will be vulnerable
clients. However, it does not make a significant difference to the
overall security of the firewall.</p><p>





The network architecture for a dual-homed host firewall is pretty
simple: the dual-homed host sits between, and is connected to, the
Internet and the internal network. <a href="ch06_01.html#ch06-57913">Figure 6-2</a> shows
this architecture.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-57913" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="256" alt="Figure 6-2" src="figs/fire2.0602.gif" width="475" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-2. Dual-homed host architecture</h4>

Dual-homed hosts can provide a very high level of control. If you
aren't allowing packets to go between external and internal
networks at all, you can be sure that any packet on the internal
network that has an external source is evidence of some kind of
security problem.</p><p>





On the other hand, dual-homed hosts aren't high-performance
devices. A dual-homed host has more work to do for each connection
than a packet filter does, and correspondingly needs more resources.
A dual-homed host won't support as much traffic as an
equivalent packet filtering system.</p><p>





Since a dual-homed host is a single point of failure, it's
important to make certain that its host security is absolutely
impeccable. An attacker who can compromise the dual-homed host has
full access to your site (no matter what protocols you are running).
An attacker who crashes the dual-homed host has cut you off from the
Internet. This makes dual-homed hosts inappropriate if being able to
reach the Internet is critical to your business.</p><p>





You are particularly vulnerable to problems with the host's IP
implementation, which can crash the machine or pass traffic through
it. These problems exist with packet filtering routers as well, but
they are less frequent and usually easier to fix. Architectures that
involve multiple devices are usually more resilient because multiple
different IP implementations are involved.</p><p>





A dual-homed host can provide services only by proxying them, or by
having users log into the dual-homed host directly. You want to avoid
having users log into the dual-homed host directly. As we discuss in
<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, user accounts present significant
security problems by themselves. They present special problems on
dual-homed hosts, where users may unexpectedly enable services you
consider insecure. Furthermore, most users find it inconvenient to
use a dual-homed host by logging into it.</p><p>





Proxying is much less problematic but may not be available for all
services you're interested in. <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>,
discusses some workarounds for this situation, but they do not apply
in every case. Using a dual-homed host as your only network
connection actually slightly eases some problems with proxying; if
the host pretends to be a router, it can intercept packets bound for
the outside world and transparently proxy them without anybody
else's cooperation.</p><p>





Proxying is much better at supporting outbound services (internal
users using resources on the Internet) than inbound services (users
on the Internet using resources on the internal network). In a
dual-homed host configuration, you will normally have to provide
services to the Internet by running them on the dual-homed host. This
is not usually advisable because providing services to the Internet
is risky, and the dual-homed host is a security-critical machine that
you don't want to put risky services on. It might be acceptable
to put a minimally functional web server on the dual-homed host (for
instance, one that was only capable of providing HTML files and had
no active content features, additional protocols, or forms
processing), but it would clearly be extremely dangerous to provide a
normal web server there.</p><p>





The screened subnet architecture we describe in a later section
offers some extra options for providing new, untrusted, or inbound
services (e.g., you can add a worthless machine to the screened
subnet that provides only an untrusted service).</p><p>





<a name="ch06-4-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.1.2.1. Appropriate uses</h3>





A dual-homed host is an appropriate firewall for a situation where:</p><p>





<ul><li>Traffic to the Internet is small.</p><p></li><li>Traffic to the Internet is not business-critical.<p></p></li><li><p>No services are being provided to Internet-based users.</p></li><li><p>The network being protected does not contain extremely valuable data.</p></li></ul>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch06-5-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.3. Multiple-Purpose Boxes</h3>





any single-box firewalls actually provide some combination of
proxying and packet filtering. This gives you many of the advantages
of both; you can allow some protocols at high speed while still
having detailed control. It also gives you many of the disadvantages
of both; you are vulnerable to problems where protocols that you
thought were forced through the proxies are simply passed on by the
packet filters. In addition, you have all the normal risks of having
only a single entity between you and the great outside world.</p><p>





<a name="ch06-6-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.1.3.1. Appropriate uses</h3>





A single machine that does both proxying and packet filtering is
appropriate for a situation where:</p><p>





<ul><li>The network to be protected is small.</p><p></li><li>No services are being provided to the Internet.<p></p></li></ul>
