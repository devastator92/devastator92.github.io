<h2 class="sect1">3.4. Weakest Link</h2>





<a name="INDEX-238" /><a name="INDEX-239" /><a name="INDEX-240" />A fundamental tenet of security is that a
chain is only as strong as its <em class="emphasis">weakest link</em> and
a wall is only as strong as its weakest point. Smart attackers are
going to seek out that weak point and concentrate their attentions
there. You need to be aware of the weak points of your defense so
that you can take steps to eliminate them, and so that you can
carefully monitor those you can't eliminate. You should try to
pay attention equally to all aspects of your security, so that there
is no large difference in how insecure one thing is as compared to
another.</p><p>





There is always going to be a weakest link, however; the trick is to
make that link strong enough and to keep the strength proportional to
the risk. For instance, it's usually reasonable to worry more
about people attacking you over the network than about people
actually coming to your site to attack you physically; therefore, you
can usually allow your physical security to be your weakest link.
It's not reasonable to neglect physical security altogether,
however, because there's still some threat there. It's
also not reasonable, for example, to protect Telnet connections very
carefully but not protect FTP connections, because of the
similarities of the risks posed by those services.</p><p>





Host security models suffer from a particularly nasty interaction
between choke points and weak links; there's no choke point,
which means that there are a very large number of links, and many of
them may be very weak indeed.</p><p>
