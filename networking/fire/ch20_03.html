<h2 class="sect1">20.3. NetBIOS for TCP/IP Name Service and Windows Internet Name Service</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1882" />
<a name="INDEX-1883" />NetBT name
service is the NetBT service used to translate NetBIOS names to IP
addresses. There are two ways to get name service under NetBT: a
broadcast mechanism in which each machine keeps a database, and a
unicast mechanism in which there is a designated server. In theory,
that designated server is called a NetBT Name Server, or NBNS.
However, Microsoft's NBNS implementation is called Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS). It's rare to see the general term
"NBNS" used outside of standards documentation, even for
non-Microsoft servers, which are technically implementations of NBNS,
not WINS.</p><p>





In order to minimize the inevitable confusion, we will call
broadcast-based NetBT name service "NetBT name service",
and unicast-based service "WINS". This reflects common
usage and is no more arbitrary and confusing than any other naming
scheme.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1884" />A NetBIOS name
is up to 15 characters long.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-121">[121]</a> NetBIOS names are "unqualified"
(according to Microsoft documentation) which means two things:</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-121" />[121]Technically speaking,
all NetBIOS names are exactly 16 characters long, and Microsoft
reserves the 16th character for administrative use. Short names are
automatically and transparently padded to 16 characters. To the user,
this is indistinguishable from having names up to 15 characters
long.</p><p>




</blockquote>





<ul><li>They must be unique within a server's area of control.</p><p></li><li>They cannot contain periods.</p></li></ul>
There is no notion of hierarchy in NetBIOS. Only one machine can be
named "foo", and there is no way to indicate in a name
what server is responsible for it. In order to reduce problems with
name collisions, Microsoft provides the concept of a NetBIOS
<em class="emphasis">scope</em>, which strongly resembles a NIS domain;
this is a string that defines a group of machines that talk to each
other. If you are using NetBIOS scopes, a machine's name needs
to be unique only within the scope. By default, machines use a null
NetBIOS scope. The NetBIOS name and scope taken together can be up to
255 characters long (effectively limiting the scope to 240
characters), and the NetBIOS scope can contain periods.</p><p>





NetBIOS scopes are much more limiting than NIS domains. Machines that
are in different NetBIOS scopes cannot speak any NetBIOS protocols to
each other, including file and printer sharing. On controlled
networks, this can actually be an advantage, as it provides a small
security improvement; the NetBIOS scope setting effectively acts as a
password for network access. This is a protection from accidental
misconfiguration, not from hostile action. The NetBIOS scope is
passed in cleartext across the network as part of the NetBIOS
hostname, and any attacker can simply read it from valid packets (it
is particularly simple because it is sent in broadcast packets, so no
special ability to snoop the network is required.)</p><p>





It is important to keep in mind that WINS and NetBT name service are
merely variants on the same service. Clients that use broadcast
resolution run their own name servers, and although they expect only
broadcast-based queries, they will respond to unicast queries. Do not
assume that you are safe from remote requests just because you have
avoided running WINS; normal NetBIOS clients are still running name
servers that will feed their own data and any other data that they
have cached to anybody who asks them. As we will see later, even
machines that use WINS exclusively must have servers running that
will respond to unicast name queries in order to have full WINS
functionality. This is one of the things that the
"Server" service normally does on clients.</p><p>





Even though these services are tightly interrelated, the same machine
may run both servers, in which case the WINS server will get unicast
packets and the NetBT name server will get broadcast packets (Unix
aficionados will probably find this upsetting). This means that the
two services will run completely independently and may have different
data on them. A WINS server will not provide data gathered by WINS to
a NetBT name service client, or data gathered by NetBT name service
to a WINS client, even though the servers are running on the same
port on the same computer. (Therefore, a machine that runs a WINS
server but is not configured as a WINS client won't advertise
its own services via WINS!)</p><p>





<a name="ch20-15-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.3.1. Name Resolution Under Windows</h3>





For historical reasons, Microsoft provides multiple methods of name
resolution. Windows 2000 uses DNS wherever possible, but other
icrosoft Windows machines may use numerous methods to translate a
name to an address, depending on their configurations. They may try
multiple methods to translate the same name, attempting various
things until something succeeds.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1885" />For this purpose, there are two kinds of
names: possible NetBIOS names and non-NetBIOS names. A genuine
NetBIOS name is one known to the NetBIOS name service, but a possible
NetBIOS name is any name that is up to 15 characters long. (In
theory, a name with a period in it is not a possible NetBIOS name,
but in fact, it will be treated as one under some versions of Windows
NT.) Names that are not possible NetBIOS names (that is, ones that
are over 15 characters long) must be resolved via DNS. The methods
recent Windows machines can use for possible NetBIOS names are:</p><p>





<ul><li>Do a local NetBIOS broadcast and see if a machine by that name
answers.</p><p></li><li>Check a local file named <em class="filename">lmhosts</em> or
<em class="filename">hosts</em> for an entry with the relevant name.</p><p></li><li>Do a WINS query.</p></li><li>Do a DNS query.</p></li></ul>
In addition, they may have the information cached and therefore not
need to look it up at all. Windows NT 4 machines that are WINS and
DNS clients by default try these options in the following order:</p><p>





<ol><li>Look in the machine's cache of name information; this includes
information for machines that have been looked up recently and
information from <em class="filename">lmhosts</em> that has been marked
#PRE, and it may include information about hosts on the local network
that have booted recently.</p><p></li><li>Do a WINS query.</p></li><li>Check a local <em class="filename">lmhosts</em> file.</p></li><li><p>Do a NetBIOS broadcast.</p></li><li><p>Check a local <em class="filename">hosts</em> file.</p></li><li><p>Do a DNS query.</p></li></ol>
Various configuration options will change this order (most notably,
if DNS support is not configured, DNS and <em class="filename">hosts</em>
will not be checked). Other operating systems prefer other orders. In
particular, older operating systems may try broadcasting before doing
a WINS query or may not support any method except broadcasting.</p><p>





icrosoft has a complicated naming scheme for describing these
options; a machine that does only broadcast is a b-node, one that
only does WINS queries is a p-node ("p" for
"point-to-point"), one that does broadcast and then WINS
is an m-node ("m" for "mixed"), and one that
does WINS first and then broadcast is an h-node ("h" for
"hybrid"). This naming scheme is useful mostly for
understanding Microsoft documentation, since knowing what kind of
node a machine is does not tell you where in the process it consults
DNS or <em class="filename">lmhosts</em>. However, you may wish to
remember that "m-node" and "b-node" both mean
a "machine that generates lots of annoying broadcast
packets". As you can determine by careful reading of the
definitions and the preceding steps, Windows NT machines configured
to use WINS are normally h-nodes.</p><p>





Clients may get DNS data without making DNS queries; WINS servers can
act as gateways into DNS, and other machines may cache DNS data and
return it in answer to NetBIOS queries. In some configurations, this
will result in a puzzling situation where the clients cannot reach
hosts with names over 15 characters long. Since these are not valid
NetBIOS names, clients must speak DNS directly in order to resolve
them.</p><p>





Just to further confuse matters, Microsoft DNS servers are capable of
acting as gateways to WINS servers, making WINS queries to try to
resolve DNS queries. This has two advantages; it obviously simplifies
DNS administration for sites that are already using WINS, by making
it nearly nonexistent. More importantly, WINS supports dynamic host
registration. When a host comes up, it tells the WINS server what its
name and network address are. By contrast, standard DNS provides no
way for a host to give this information to the server; the server
must be preconfigured with the name-address mapping. (DNS and dynamic
update are discussed earlier.) Forwarding DNS queries to WINS
provides dynamic DNS registration without modification of DNS.</p><p>





The <em class="emphasis">nbtstat</em> command will show you information
about NetBT names on a machine. Using <em class="emphasis">nbtstat</em> to
check NetBT naming information and <em class="emphasis">nslookup</em> to
check DNS naming information will often help you straighten out
questions about where information is coming from (and therefore what
to fix in order to get things to work correctly).<a name="INDEX-1886" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.3.2. NetBIOS Names</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1887" />
<a name="INDEX-1888" />NetBT name service is used to resolve
more than just hostnames. There are two basic types of NetBT names:
unique names and group names. A unique name maps to exactly one IP
address, while a group name may map to multiple IP addresses. Each of
these has multiple subtypes, used for different purposes. For
instance, one type of group name is used to indicate a multihomed
host; another type is used to indicate an administrative group (all
the printers, for instance); and a third type is used for showing
domain and workgroup membership. Different types of unique names are
used for different services. The sixteenth byte of a NetBIOS name is
used to indicate the type, and this byte is typically shown in
hexadecimal notation when names are displayed (you may see type 03
displayed as "0x03", "&lt;03&gt;", or
"03h").</p><p>





If you actually look at packet traces, particularly if you are using
a packet trace system that is not aware of NetBT, you may see NetBIOS
names in mangled form. NetBT is based on DNS packet formats. DNS
names are longer than NetBIOS names but can't contain the
arbitrary hexadecimal values NetBIOS uses for type indicators. In
order to make NetBIOS names fit into DNS name fields, NetBT applies a
system that converts each byte of the NetBIOS name into two uppercase
ASCII characters, which results in eye-catching, if incomprehensible,
name strings. They are made even more noticeable by the fact that the
mangling algorithm converts spaces, which are used for padding, into
"CA", so that almost every name ends in
"CACA". Many English speakers (including presumably the
engineer who designed the algorithm) attach no special meaning to
this string, but the repeating pattern is still very striking. For
details of the name-mangling algorithm, see RFC 1001. If you are on a
icrosoft machine, most packet sniffing programs will unmangle the
names for you; if you are on a Unix machine, the Samba package
contains name mangling and unmangling routines. See <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>, for information on how to get Samba.</p><p>





When a computer boots, it registers multiple names of different
types. These names are not necessarily based on the hostname of the
machine; they are chosen according to the purpose the name will be
used for. For instance, one of the NetBT names that machines normally
register is a unique name for the Messenger service. This service is
used to send messages, and if a user is logged in to the console of
the machine, the Messenger service will be registered under the
user's name as well as under the computer's name. This is
designed to allow you to send messages to people by name (human
beings rarely want to talk to computers, after all), but it means
that NetBT name registrations will contain not only hostnames, but
also usernames, and in many cases will let you figure out whether or
not somebody is logged in to a machine.</p><p>





A machine will also register a group name for the workgroup or domain
it is part of. This does not make the machine a valid member of a
domain; machines may register as parts of domains they don't
belong to, and it will not have any security implications. For
clients, there is no difference between the registration for a domain
and a workgroup. Domain controllers will make some extra
registrations; there is a group name for all of the domain
controllers and a unique name for the primary domain controller.</p><p>





In addition, machines that are running the Windows Browser server
will register a number of special names used by this service. These
name registrations are sometimes treated specially. See the section
on the Windows Browser, later in this chapter, for more information
about these names and their registration.</p><p>





Group names can contain large numbers of hosts, which makes them
expensive to maintain. As a result, WINS servers are allowed to skip
a lot of the verification they do on hostnames when they're
dealing with group names, and invalid group names may remain
registered for long periods of time. <a name="INDEX-1889" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">20.3.3. NetBT Name Service Operations</h3>





DNS is a simple question-and-answer system. NetBT name service,
because it's dynamic, is nowhere near as straightforward.
Clients and servers interact in numerous ways, in order to register
names, refresh and release them, and look up other names. The details
of this process are quite intricate, and despite the daunting amount
of detail here, a number of special cases and possible interactions
have been glossed over.</p><p>





<a name="ch20-18-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.3.3.1. General principles of NetBT operations</h3>





There are some generalizations about how NetBT name service works:</p><p>





<ul><li>Queries may be broadcast or unicast, but responses are always unicast
to the host that made the query.</p><p></li><li>WINS servers respond to all requests with positive or negative
answers (in fact, if a query takes any significant amount of time to
process, they will return an intermediate answer called a
<em class="emphasis">wait acknowledgment</em> or WACK). NetBT name servers
dealing with broadcast requests, however, answer only if they have
something to say.</p><p></li><li>Clients will always repeat a query if there is no answer (even if it
is a broadcast query to which no answer was expected).</p><p></li></ul>
</div>









<a name="ch20-19-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.3.3.2. Name registration</h3>





When a client starts up, it registers the names it wants to answer
to, starting with a name registration request. Under NetBT name
service, it does this by broadcasting the registration request; with
WINS, the request is sent directly to the WINS server. In either
case, it may turn out that some other machine already has a name the
client wants, which will set off a procedure of name conflict
resolution that's discussed later. A WINS server will always
answer the request, while NetBT name servers will answer name
registration requests only in order to dispute them. If the name is
not already taken, the client will send out a name announcement that
confirms that it has the name to the same place or places it sent the
original request.</p><p>





For a normally configured Windows NT machine that's trying to
register the nonconflicting name "unique" and is
configured with a WINS server address, the process looks like this:</p><p>





<ol><li>The machine sends a name registration request for
"unique" to the WINS server.</p><p></li><li>The WINS server updates its database and sends a positive response
containing a time-to-live (TTL).</p><p></li><li>The machine broadcasts a name registration request for
"unique" and gets no response.</p><p></li><li>The machine broadcasts another three name registration requests for
"unique", just in case, and still gets no response.</p><p></li><li>The machine sends a name announcement to the broadcast address.</p></li><li>All machines that receive the broadcast cache the information
temporarily, overwriting any previous entry they had for that name.</p><p></li></ol>
</div>









<a name="ch20-20-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.3.3.3. Name refresh</h3>





In order to keep WINS server databases free of old junk data, WINS
servers hand out limited-time registrations. Clients need to send a
name refresh request before the TTL given to them with the name
registration expires. If they don't send a name refresh, the
WINS server will eventually remove the name. This process is not
particularly fast. Windows NT normally gives out registrations with
six-day TTLs, so a client that goes away may still be visible in the
database for up to six days if nobody tries to release or register
the name.</p><p>





Clients may also send out name refresh requests for reasons of their
own (for instance, a client that changes its configuration to use
WINS will send a name refresh request to the WINS server).</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-21-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.3.3.4. Name resolution</h3>





When a client wants to map a name to an IP address, it sends out a
name query request, either by broadcast or to the WINS server. Every
machine that has a mapping for the name will reply with that mapping.
A WINS server will reply to the request even if it doesn't have
the answer. Suppose "unique" wants to talk to
"stupid", which is a misconfigured client on the local
network that doesn't use WINS and didn't boot recently.
The procedure will look like this:</p><p>





<ol><li>"unique" checks its cache but doesn't find
"stupid" there (if "stupid" had just booted,
it would have worked).</p><p></li><li>"unique" sends a name query request to the WINS server.</p></li><li>The WINS server sends a negative response.</p></li><li><p>"unique" broadcasts a name query request.</p></li><li><p>All machines that know where "stupid" is, including
"stupid" itself and every machine that's connected
to it recently, return responses. "unique" believes the
first answer it gets.</p><p></li></ol>
</div>









<a name="ch20-22-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.3.3.5. Name release</h3>





When a client shuts down or changes its name, it sends a name release
request to the WINS server and/or the broadcast address to give
notice that the name is now available. As usual, the WINS server will
always respond, while other servers will respond only if they have
something to say (in this case, if they reject the name release). A
client that is trying to release its own name will consider a name
released and continue if it receives any response to the name release
request (positive or negative). If it gets no answer, it will try
again before continuing.</p><p>





Name release requests may also be sent by machines other than the
client that registered the name. This is supposed to allow a machine
to correct invalid data. A machine that receives a response from the
server, but gets no response at that address, can send a name release
request for the name. The WINS server will then do a name query
request and release the name if it fails. Other servers will respond
to name release requests only for names that they own, for which they
will return negative responses. A client that tries to release
somebody else's name pays attention to the contents of the
response and does not release a name for which it gets a negative
response.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch20-23-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">20.3.3.6. Conflict management </h3>





What happens if a machine tries to register a name as a unique name,
but it's already in use, or tries to refresh a name that some
other host has registered? Using broadcasts, when a machine sends out
the name registration request, the machine that already has the name
registered will respond with a negative response. Machines that have
conflicting cached data will not respond.</p><p>





A WINS server has a somewhat more complicated task. It can't be
sure that the existing record it has is for a machine that's
still running -- in fact, there's a significant chance that
the existing record is actually for the same machine, and it's
just been moved from one network to another. Therefore, the WINS
server will check to see if the record is correct by sending a name
query request for the name to the address it's registered at.
If the host is still there, it will answer, and the WINS server will
send a negative response to the new registration.</p><p>





There's an important subtlety to note here. Machines that are
not WINS servers normally receive name query requests only via
broadcast; unicast name queries are the business of WINS. But name
query requests used for conflict resolution and verification of
third-party release requests are unicast, so non-WINS servers must
answer them. Machines that don't run name servers cannot defend
against conflicting name registrations, even if they otherwise use
WINS.</p><p>





Conflict management is one case where groups have a special
exemption. If a host tries to register an existing group name as a
unique name, the WINS server is not required to check that the group
registration is still valid; it can simply reject the attempt.

<a name="ch20-24-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.3.4. WINS Server-Server Communication</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1891" /> <a name="INDEX-1892" />As well as picking up information from
clients as they boot, WINS servers can also exchange information with
other WINS servers. This approach is used to provide redundancy and
to allow name information to be propagated across large networks.</p><p>





Unlike DNS servers, WINS servers have no hierarchical structure and
do not normally forward queries from one server to another.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-122">[122]</a> WINS servers that talk
to each other are trying to cause both servers to have identical
databases. The replication protocol uses several tricks to try to
distribute only updates rather than entire databases between servers,
but there is nothing like a DNS zone that would allow them to
subdivide the database.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-122" />[122]The protocol allows a WINS server to answer a query by
directing the client to query another server, but this facility does
not appear to be used in practice; in any case, there is no direct
server-server forwarding.</p><p>




</blockquote>





WINS server replication is a complicated topic, involving numerous
options (for instance, WINS servers need not replicate
symmetrically). The details are beyond the scope of this book but are
covered in most references about Windows NT network administration
(for instance, in Microsoft's <em class="emphasis">Windows NT Server
Networking Guide</em>, Microsoft Press, which is part of the
Windows NT Server Resource Kit). From a firewall point of view, the
interesting points about WINS server replication are:</p><p>





<ul><li>WINS servers speak to each other over TCP port 42.</p><p></li><li>WINS servers attempt to locate replication partners via multicast and
will send out IGMP packets to register multicast addresses for this
purpose. IGMP is discussed in <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>.</p><p></li><li>No matter what kind of WINS replication you establish, a pair of
replicating WINS servers will make connections in both directions
(you cannot set up replication so that only one of the two servers
needs to be able to initiate a connection).</p><p></li></ul>
WINS servers may have "push" or "pull"
partners, but in fact, data is transferred between them only when the
receiving machine requests it. A machine that tries to
"push" data will simply inform the other machine that new
data is available, and the other machine will then request the data.</p><p>





By default, WINS servers will send data only to machines that are
configured as replication partners. It can be reset via the WINS
anager or the registry. It should be left in the default mode to
help prevent attackers from pretending to be replication partners and
pulling the entire WINS database with all of its information about
valid hostnames and usernames.<a name="INDEX-1893" /> <a name="INDEX-1894" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-25-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.3.5. The WINS Manager</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1895" />It is possible
to control and configure WINS servers on remote machines with the
WINS manager, which uses Microsoft RPC. The security implications of
icrosoft RPC are discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-26-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.3.6. Security Implications of NetBT Name Service and WINS</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1896" />
<a name="INDEX-1897" />NetBT Name Service and WINS are very
vulnerable and are much more sensitive than DNS. The information they
provide is valuable to attackers; it's not just the hostname
data DNS provides, which is already useful, but also information
about what usernames are valid and whether anybody is logged in, plus
structural information about what machines provide what services.
This information gives all sorts of leads to further possible
attacks.</p><p>





In addition, these services modify their databases and take other
actions based on information from clients, which vastly magnifies the
risks. An attacker who can send packets to a WINS server can cause
the WINS server to send packets other places, using it as an
amplifier to spread denial of service attacks and as a gateway to get
those attacks to networks that may not be directly vulnerable to the
attacker. It's also easy for an attacker to contaminate NetBT
name service and WINS databases with bad data, which is relatively
difficult in DNS.</p><p>





The protocols are more complex than DNS. The extra protocol layers
and headers are all opportunities for implementors to introduce bugs
that can become denial of service attacks. Some of these problems
have already been found by accident by people implementing these
protocols on other platforms and are fixed in recent versions; others
are presumably lurking, waiting for malicious people to run out of
easier targets.</p><p>





Finally, DNS servers are relatively rare. Any given site has a
handful. NetBT name servers are everywhere. Every machine that uses
NetBT name service must also be a NetBT name server. For an attacker
who is going after quantity, rather than quality, NetBT name service
is a very tempting target; it has information-rich servers everywhere
accepting queries and data from arbitrary hosts.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch20-27-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.3.7. Packet Filtering Characteristics of NetBT Name Service</h3>





NetBT name service uses TCP and UDP port 137. Almost all NetBT name
service traffic will be UDP; clients normally use TCP only if they
issue a query via UDP and get a truncated response because the
response is too long to fit into a single UDP packet. However,
servers will respond to any query via TCP. Microsoft implementations
use port 137 for queries as well as responses. Some older versions
will return UDP responses to port 137 regardless of the port the
query was made from. Given that most requests are UDP, and both ends
are at port 137, it is basically impossible to allow service in a
single direction. (Since server-initiated queries are part of
conflict resolution, it wouldn't help much anyway.)</p><p>





Clients that do not use WINS will send queries to the broadcast
address; responses always are unicast, as are WINS queries. WINS
servers will try to use multicast to contact replication partners and
will therefore generate IGMP packets (see <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>, for packet filtering details of IGMP). WINS
server replication uses TCP port 42.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">20.3.8. Proxying Characteristics of NetBT Name Service and WINS</h3>





icrosoft provides something called a <em class="emphasis">WINS proxy
service</em>, which turns broadcast NetBIOS name resolution
requests into WINS requests, in order to allow non-WINS clients to
use a WINS server. This is a form of proxying, although it also is
changing the protocol in use.</p><p>





It would be perfectly possible to do more traditional firewall
proxying of WINS, but there do not appear to be any implementations
available.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">20.3.9. Network Address Translation Characteristics of NetBT Name Service and WINS</h3>





Because these protocols are attempting to maintain mappings between
names and IP addresses, they frequently contain embedded IP
addresses. Furthermore, these addresses are often deep in the content
of the packet (not simply in the NetBT destination headers used by
many other NetBT-based protocols). A network address translator would
have to be aware of the details of the protocol in order to
successfully translate all of the embedded addresses. In any case,
you cannot save address space by using a network address translator
if you run the name service through it, since all hosts will attempt
to register their names and addresses.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">20.3.10. Summary of Recommendations for NetBT Name Service and WINS</h3>





<ul><li>Do not allow WINS queries or server replication across your firewall.</p><p></li><li>Bastion hosts that are configured not to respond to name requests
will be unable to defend themselves from other hosts that try to take
over their names via NetBT. These machines should be statically
configured into WINS servers or accessed via 16-character names that
cannot be resolved with NetBT. See <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, for
more information.<a name="INDEX-1898" /> <a name="INDEX-1899" /></p><p></li></ul>
