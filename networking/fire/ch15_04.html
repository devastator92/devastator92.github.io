<h2 class="sect1">15.4. Mobile Code and Web-Related Languages</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1429" /> <a name="INDEX-1430" />As we mentioned earlier, most web
browsers support one or more ways of accepting arbitrary programs
from servers. In general, systems that move programs from one machine
to another are called <em class="emphasis">mobile</em>
<em class="emphasis">code</em> systems. Although these systems are
commonly implemented in web browsers, they may also be used other
places. For instance, some web servers also support running them on
the server itself; Java and ActiveX are used entirely independently
of the Web for application development; and many web browsers that
support using JavaScript and VBScript in web pages also interpret
them when included in email or news messages.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1431" />Mobile code systems take two fundamental
approaches to the security problem. Most of them attempt to keep
programs from doing anything dangerous, or at least from doing
anything dangerous without asking you about it first. For instance,
JavaScript isn't allowed to write files to your disk without
your consent; Java isn't allowed to open network connections to
any server other than the one that your original connection was to.
This approach results in web pages that can't quite do what you
want but can still do some things that you don't want.</p><p>





To avoid this problem, ActiveX takes the second approach and uses
digital signatures to attempt to give you some idea where a program
comes from, in the hope that this will tell you whether or not to
trust it. There are no restrictions on what an ActiveX control can
do. This approach results in web pages that you're not certain
whether or not to trust. Who is the person who signed it? Do you
trust that person to be both well intentioned and competent to write
security-critical programs? If a program is not signed, is it because
the author is evil, or because the author is lazy, uneducated about
digital signatures, or arguing with the signature authority?</p><p>





These two approaches are being combined, allowing you to decide
exactly what a program can do based on what you know about who wrote
it. This is still imperfect, but it's the most promising
approach, and both Java and ActiveX are moving in this direction.</p><p>





<a name="ch15-18-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.1. JavaScript </h3>





<a name="INDEX-1432" />JavaScript
is a scripting language that is completely unrelated to Java and is
used as an extension language for web browsers. Microsoft's
implementation of JavaScript is called JScript; you may also see
icrosoft refer to the language as ECMAScript because it has been
standardized by the European Community Manufacturer's
Association (ECMA).</p><p>





JavaScript attempts to provide security by limiting what it's
possible to do. For instance, JavaScript does not have commands for
reading and writing files. Furthermore, programs written in
JavaScript are supposed to be able to access only limited amounts of
data: information about user preferences, available plug-ins and
capabilities of the browser, and links and forms in the document that
contains the script and in windows created by that web page.
JavaScript programs can communicate to the outside world only by
submitting forms.</p><p>





A web page with a JavaScript program can contain something that is
technically a form without being visible, and JavaScript can fill in
that form with any information it can get to and submit it
automatically. If your web browser is configured to ask for
confirmation before submitting forms, you will see a warning; if not,
the entire transaction will be silent. Furthermore, submitting a form
simply consists of sending information in a predefined format to a
URL, which can specify any IP address and port number. This means
that submitting forms effectively lets JavaScript send any
information it has to anybody it thinks should have it, possibly
without notifying you. This is one of the reasons that web browsers
warn you about form submissions, and it is a good reason for leaving
these warnings in place.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1433" />Most JavaScript security problems
fall into one of two categories: denial of service attacks that hang
or crash the browser (or, if you're really unlucky, the entire
computer), and bugs in the data access limitations that allow
JavaScript programs to read arbitrary files and return the data to
the site that the page came from. In addition, there have been
occasional buffer overflow problems with JavaScript implementations.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1434" />The
denial of service attacks are, as usual, unavoidable, but
they're no worse than annoying. Ones that actually crash the
browser or manage to affect the machine are straightforward
implementation bugs, and fixes are usually rapidly available. The
standard way to hang the browser is to code an infinite loop.</p><p>





While JavaScript programs cannot directly open files, these programs
can cause the web browser to open them by giving the browser local
URLs to open (for instance, <em class="emphasis">file:/etc/passwd</em>).
When the JavaScript security is correctly implemented, this is not a
problem, since JavaScript still can't get the data out of the
newly opened URLs. However, there have been a series of bugs with the
handling of this particular limitation, where the browser becomes
confused about the correct context for scripts or data embedded in
odd places. For instance, scripts in the titles of pages may be
executed in the process of reading bookmarks, and scripts can manage
to execute in windows that are supposed to be displaying source code.
There have been dozens of bugs in context handling, all of which have
roughly similar effects; the script returns data it shouldn't
have to the server it was on. That data ranges from information about
sites that have been visited recently to the contents of arbitrary
files on the disk.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1435" />
<a name="INDEX-1436" />The buffer overflow problems are,
strictly speaking, not JavaScript vulnerabilities at all. They occur
when the interpreter gets invalid JavaScript and the interpreter
itself fails to enforce buffer limitations. There is a known problem
with buffer overflows on some JavaScript calls in some versions of
Internet Explorer 4.0.</p><p>





JavaScript can use ActiveX or Java, if they are enabled, to get
access to capabilities that JavaScript alone would not have. If
ActiveX or Java is enabled in the browser, JavaScript can use them
without containing any visible ActiveX or Java objects. This means
that filtering out ActiveX and Java is not sufficient to protect a
site. You must also filter out scripting languages or disable ActiveX
and Java in all browsers.<a name="INDEX-1437" /></p><p>

<a name="ch15-19-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.2. VBScript</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1438" />
<a name="INDEX-1439" />VBScript is a subset of
Visual Basic provided by Microsoft as an extension language for web
browsers and servers. VBScript provides much the same functionality
that JavaScript does -- in fact, Microsoft tries to maintain it at
the same level. Like JavaScript, VBScript is designed to provide
security by avoiding unsafe operations. VBScript is often used in
conjunction with ActiveX, and VBScript security is often confused
with ActiveX security, but there's no need to enable ActiveX in
order to use VBScript (nor do you need VBScript in order to use
ActiveX; you can use ActiveX controls from JavaScript just as well).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1440" />There don't appear
to be any reported VBScript security problems; this does not indicate
that VBScript is secure. What it does indicate is that JavaScript is
implemented by more browsers than VBScript, while ActiveX is more
powerful than VBScript. Therefore, attackers are going to concentrate
on JavaScript and ActiveX until they've exhausted their obvious
possibilities. Because VBScript provides the same capabilities that
JavaScript does, VBScript vulnerabilities are likely to fall into the
same sort of categories as JavaScript vulnerabilities, involving
mostly denial of service attacks and ways to read data.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch15-20-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.3. Java</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1441" />
<a name="INDEX-1442" /> <a name="INDEX-1443" />Java is a full-fledged programming
language that is commonly used as an extension language for web
browsers. Java uses what is called a <em class="emphasis">sandbox</em>
security model, which tries to provide security by limiting the
functionality available to a program.</p><p>





In general, programming languages are divided into interpreted
languages and compiled languages. An interpreted language, like Perl
or Visual Basic, is one where you write a program, and when you want
to run it, you give it to an interpreter in the same form that you
wrote it. The interpreter, which is run every time you run a program
in the language, is responsible for turning human-readable commands
into instructions the computer can execute. A compiled language, like
C, is one where you write a program and run it through a compiler
once to get an executable. You can then run the executable all by
itself; you don't need another program to make it run.</p><p>





Interpreted languages are machine independent. You have a different
interpreter for each kind of machine but run the same programs.
Compiled languages, on the other hand, are machine dependent; once
you compile a program, the result will run on only one kind of
machine. On the other hand, a program that is running through an
interpreter is slower than one that has been compiled. In addition,
when you give somebody a program in an interpreted language,
it's easy for them to modify it and reuse it, while a compiled
program is much more difficult to alter.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1444" />Java uses an
intermediate option, sometimes called <em class="emphasis">byte</em>
<em class="emphasis">compiling</em>. A program written in Java is compiled
into machine-independent Java byte code, which is then turned into
computer instructions by an interpreter usually called the Java
Virtual Machine. This gives some of the advantages of compiled code
(it's faster to run than an interpreted language, and the code
is not in an easily modifiable form) and some of the advantages of
interpreted code (it's machine independent). It also gives it
many of the disadvantages of both; it's slower than compiled
code, you have to have an interpreter to do anything with it, and you
can have problems with bugs in either the compiler or the
interpreter. Just as it is possible for a determined person to write
a program directly in machine language, without using a traditional
compiler, it's possible for a determined person to write a
program directly in Java byte code, without using a Java compiler,
and the result may be acceptable to the interpreter even if it
couldn't be generated from any program the compiler would
accept.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1445" />There are security features in both the
Java byte-code compiler and the Java runtime interpreter. In general,
you should think of the Java compiler as providing security to Java
programmers; it helps people write Java programs that cannot be
attacked by hostile users. (For instance, Java programs are not
susceptible to buffer overflow problems.) The Java interpreter
provides security to Java users; it is supposed to keep hostile Java
programs from damaging machines. Because people can write Java byte
code directly, you can't rely on the compiler to protect you
from malicious programs.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1446" />Instead, what you're relying on is
something called the <em class="emphasis">security</em>
<em class="emphasis">manager</em>, which is part of the runtime
interpreter. The security manager is responsible for determining what
a program is allowed to do. It does this by looking at each separate
action the program attempts to take and comparing that to the
security policy that's in force. Normally, there are two
possible security policies: one that covers normal programs, which
doesn't put any limitations in place, and one that covers
programs that have been downloaded from the network, which restricts
what files can be read and written, how much memory and disk space a
program can use, and what network connections it can make.</p><p>





The security manager doesn't directly control the operations
that the program performs. Instead, it controls what functions the
program can call. For instance, insecure programs are not normally
allowed to write to disk, but if there is a library that is supposed
to be safe for use by insecure programs, an insecure program can call
that library and have the library write to disk. Effectively, this is
the same sort of restriction as allowing a child to eat cookies, but
only if an adult gets the cookies; you are requiring transactions to
go through a theoretically trustworthy intermediary that will impose
limits on them.</p><p>





There are two main risks to this model. First, there is the risk that
the security manager will permit something that it should have
denied. Second, there is the risk that a theoretically secure library
will contain insecure operations. Java has had problems with both of
these, but mostly with the security manager. The security manager has
a very complex task, and it is extremely difficult to implement
correctly. Since the original release of Java, people have found both
implementation and design flaws with some regularity. Although these
have been rapidly fixed for the most part, and the rate has
considerably slowed down, it is reasonable to expect that there will
be continuing problems.<a name="INDEX-1447" /> <a name="INDEX-1448" /> <a name="INDEX-1449" /></p><p>

<a name="ch15-21-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.4. ActiveX</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1450" />ActiveX
is not actually a programming language but a way of distributing
objects that can then be used by multiple other languages. Unlike the
other systems we have discussed, it distributes machine-specific
code. A Java, JavaScript, or VBScript program will run on any machine
that supports the language; an ActiveX control is an executable
program targeted to a specific kind of processor, and you will not be
able to run an ActiveX control built for an Intel processor on an
Alpha processor, for instance.</p><p>





ActiveX is an extension and update of Microsoft's Object
Linking and Embedding system (OLE). ActiveX controls can be written
in any of a number of languages, including C and Visual Basic, and
can be accessed from an even wider variety of languages. In the
context of the Web, they are usually used from HTML, JavaScript, or
VBScript, but they can be used from Java as well. No matter what
language is used to access an ActiveX control, it is the ActiveX
security model that applies to the control, not the calling
language's; this is important because it means that an ActiveX
control used in a Java program will not be constrained by the Java
sandbox.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1451" />ActiveX security is provided in two ways.
First, there are limitations on when an ActiveX control can be read
in; second, there are limitations on when an existing ActiveX control
can be executed. These limitations are part of the implementation of
the current ActiveX interpreters, not part of the language design, so
there is no guarantee that future ActiveX implementations will have
the same characteristics.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1452" />The most famous aspect of ActiveX
security is its use of digital signatures, which is part of the
security system for reading in ActiveX controls. An ActiveX control
may be signed with a digital signature, which theoretically allows
you to identify the author of the control and make a decision as to
whether or not to allow the control to be loaded. ActiveX controls do
not have to be signed, but unsigned controls are normally treated
differently from signed controls. (See <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>,
for further discussion of digital signatures and what they mean to
you.) By default, unsigned controls from external web pages are
rejected, and signed controls request confirmation.</p><p>





Digital signatures are checked when a control is loaded, but once the
control has been loaded, it has to be used in order for anything to
happen. The ActiveX model also provides controls over when a control
can be run. You can choose to allow controls to run, forbid them from
running, or be asked every time something attempts to run a control.
By default, controls are allowed to run without confirmation.</p><p>





In addition, a control can claim to be safe for use with untrusted
data and/or safe for use from scripts. By default, a control cannot
be run by an external web page unless it claims both these
properties. A control that claims both these properties is supposed
to be one that will never do anything bad, even if used hostilely.
Programs like Internet Explorer that use ActiveX objects look at
these properties to decide whether or not to allow a control to be
run. Aside from these restrictions, once a control has been loaded
for any purpose, it is available from any program.</p><p>





Note that this means that if a control is present on your local disk,
and it claims to be safe for use with untrusted data and safe for use
from scripts, any web page can run it, and no request for
confirmation will be made before it is run. This can lead to
unpleasant surprises. Many vendors have preinstalled ActiveX controls
that will allow arbitrary commands to be run and have incorrectly
marked them as safe for scripting. Not only have third-party vendors
like Compaq shipped machines with dangerous ActiveX controls, but
even Microsoft, in Windows 98, provided a control marked as safe for
scripting that could be used to run arbitrary programs.</p><p>





Obviously, the same sort of thing can be done with controls
downloaded from web pages. You may download a control from one web
site, which is then activated by another. Less obviously, if you go
to a page and download a control once, when you revisit the page, it
will attempt to download the control again. If you do not let it
download the control, you will still have the original copy of the
control installed, and the page will happily continue to run that
copy, which is presumably not what you had in mind (if you wanted it
to run the control, you would have let it download the control).
People who have just clicked No on a download dialog box are usually
surprised and outraged when the control runs, since the distinction
between downloading and running is not normally
