<h2 class="sect1">0.3. Platforms</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1" />To a large extent,
this book is platform-independent. Because most of the information
provided here consists of general principles, most of it should be
applicable to you, regardless of what equipment, software, and
networking you are using. The most platform-specific issue is
what type of system to use as a bastion host. People have
successfully built bastion hosts (which we describe in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>) using all kinds of computers, including Unix
systems, Windows NT machines, Macintoshes, VMS VAXes, and
others.<a name="INDEX-2" />
<a name="INDEX-3" /></p><p>





Having said this, we must acknowledge that this book is strongly
oriented towards Unix (including Linux), with Windows NT as a major
secondary theme. There are several reasons for this orientation.
First, these operating systems are the dominant operating systems in
the Internet world. Unix is still the predominant operating system
for Internet servers, although Windows NT is a strong presence.
Another reason is, of course, that our own experience is primarily in
the Unix world; we have entered the world of Windows NT only
recently, as it started to intersect with the world of the Internet.
Although we do speak Windows NT, we do so with a strong Unix accent.</p><p>





Linux, while it is not strictly speaking Unix, is a close relative of
the Unix we have spent our careers working with. In many cases, it is
truer to the Unix tradition than commercial operating systems
entitled to use the Unix trademark. While we do mention Linux by name
in some places, you should bear in mind that all of our statements
about Unix are meant to include Linux except when we explicitly state
otherwise.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-4" />Similarly,
when we mention "Windows NT", unless we explicitly
mention versions, we mean both Windows NT 4 and Windows 2000. Windows
2000 is a direct descendant of Windows NT 4 and behaves like it in
most important respects. We call out differences where appropriate
(although you should bear in mind that Windows 2000 was being
released as this book went to press; both the operating system and
the world's experience with it are bound to have changed by the
time you read this).</p><p>
