<h2 class="sect1">1.6. Religious Arguments</h2>





The world is full of "religious arguments", philosophical
debates on which people hold strong and divisive beliefs. Firewalls
are no exception to this rule.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-620" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.6.1. Buying Versus Building</h3>





<a name="INDEX-67" /><a name="INDEX-68" /><a name="INDEX-69" />Initially, if a site wanted a firewall,
they had little choice but to design and build it themselves (perhaps
with their own staff, or perhaps by hiring a consultant or
contractor). Over the years, however, more and more commercial
firewall offerings have reached the market. These products continue
to grow in number and functionality at an astounding rate, and many
sites may find that one of these products suits their needs. Most
sites find that commercial products are at least a valuable component
of their firewall solution.</p><p>





In deciding whether or not a particular commercial firewall product
will meet your needs, you have to understand what your needs are.
Even if you decide to buy a firewall, you still need to understand a
fair bit about how they're built and how they work in order to
make an informed purchasing decision. Many sites spend as much or
more effort evaluating commercial firewall products as they would
building their own firewall.</p><p>





We're not saying that nobody should buy a firewall, or that
everybody should build their own. Our point is merely that it's
not necessarily any easier to buy than it is to build; it all depends
on your particular situation and what resources you have at your
disposal. Sites with money to spend but little staff time or
expertise available often find buying an attractive solution, while
sites with expertise and time but little money often find building
more attractive.</p><p>





Just what expertise do you need to design and build your own
firewall? Like everything else, it depends; it depends on what
services you want to provide, what platforms you're using, what
your security concerns are, and so on. To install most of the tools
described in this book, you need basic Internet skills to obtain the
tools, and basic system administration skills to configure, compile,
and install them. If you don't know what those skills are, you
probably don't have them; you can obtain them, but that's
beyond the scope of this book.</p><p>





Some people feel uncomfortable using software that's freely
available on the Internet, particularly for security-critical
applications. We feel that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
You may not have the "guarantees" offered by vendors, but
you have the ability to inspect the source code and to share
information with the large community that helps to maintain the
software. In practice, vendors come and go, but the community
endures. The packages we discuss in this book are widely used; many
of the largest sites on the Internet base their firewalls on them.
These packages reflect years of real-life experience with the
Internet and its risks.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-8-fm2xml" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Software, Freedom, and Money</h4>





A number of terms are used for various kinds of software that you may
(or may not) be able to use without paying money to anybody:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Free software</i></dt>
<dd>This term is unfortunately ambiguous; sometimes it means software
that you don't have to pay for ("free software"
like "free beer"), and sometimes it refers to software
that has been liberated from certain kinds of constraints, by very
carefully tying it up with others ("free software" like
"free speech"). In practice, you cannot be sure that it
means anything at all, although it strongly implies that you will be
able to use the software without paying for it (but not necessarily
resell it in any form).</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<dl>
<dt><i>Freely available software</i></dt>
<dd>This term clearly means software that you don't have to pay
for, although it is sometimes used for software that only some
classes of users have to pay for (for instance, software that is free
to individuals but costs money for corporations).</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<dl>
<dt><i>Public domain software</i></dt>
<dd>Although this term is often carelessly used, it has a specific legal
meaning and refers to software that is free of copyright restrictions
and may be used in any way whatsoever without the permission of the
author. Software is public domain only if it is clearly marked as
such; software that contains a copyright notice or use restrictions
is not public domain. You may copy public domain software without
paying for it, but because there are no use restrictions, nothing
keeps people from charging you money for it anyway.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<dl>
<dt><i>Open source software</i></dt>
<dd>Open source software is software that you can get the source code for
without a fee. In most cases, you may also use it, at least for some
purposes, without paying, although licensing restrictions will
usually prevent you from selling it to anybody else.</p><p></dd>

</dl>




</td></tr></table><p></blockquote>

Other people feel uncomfortable using commercial software for
security-critical applications, feeling that you can't trust
software unless you can read the code. While there are real
advantages to having code available, auditing code is difficult, and
few people can do an adequate job on a package of any significant
size. Commercial software has its own advantages; when you buy
software you have a legal contract with somebody, which may give you
some recourse if things go wrong.</p><p>





Frequently, people argue that open source software is more risky than
commercial software because attackers have access to the source code.
In practice, the attackers have access to all the source code they
need, including commercial source code. If it's not given to
them, they steal or reverse-engineer it; they have the motivation and
time, and they don't have ethical constraints. There's no
distinction between programs on this point.</p><p>





While it's perfectly possible to build a firewall consisting
solely of freely available software or solely of commercial software,
there's no reason to feel that it's all or nothing;
freely available tools provide a valuable complement to purchased
solutions. Buying a firewall shouldn't make you reluctant to
supplement with freely available tools, and building one
shouldn't make you reluctant to supplement with purchased
tools. Don't rule out a product just because it's
commercial, or just because it's freely available. Truly
excellent products with great support appear in both categories, as
do poorly thought out products with no support.<a name="INDEX-70" /><a name="INDEX-71" /><a name="INDEX-72" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.6.2. Unix Versus Windows NT</h3>





Building a firewall requires at least one Internet-aware server (and
often more than one). Until relatively recently, the only popular
platform that provided the necessary services was Unix. These days,
Windows NT also has the necessary characteristics; it provides a
security-aware and network-aware multi-user operating system and is
widely used.</p><p>





any people argue violently about which is better, Unix or Windows
NT, in every domain. These arguments are particularly vociferous when
it comes to firewalls, where Unix people tend to say that Windows NT
machines are simply unsuited to building firewalls, and Windows NT
people say that this is pure prejudice.</p><p>





The truth, as always, is somewhere between the two camps. The Unix
people who complain about Windows NT are usually working from a basis
of both prejudice and ignorance, and have an annoying tendency to
misconfigure machines and then complain that they don't work. A
properly configured Windows NT machine is a reasonable machine for
building a firewall.</p><p>





On the other hand, Windows NT machines are genuinely more difficult
to configure properly for firewalls, for two reasons. The most widely
cited Windows NT problem has to do with the way Windows NT implements
the TCP/IP networking standards. Unix is one of the earliest systems
to do TCP/IP, and many Unix implementations of TCP/IP share a more
than 20-year common heritage. In that time, they've seen almost
every way you can torture a networking protocol, and they've
been made quite reliable. Microsoft reimplemented TCP/IP from scratch
for Windows NT, and the resulting code has problems that have faded
into distant memories for Unix (or never existed; different
programmers make different mistakes). An unstable TCP/IP
implementation is a real problem in a firewall, which may be exposed
to a lot of hostile or incompetent programs doing eccentric things
with TCP/IP.</p><p>





On the other hand, it's not as big a problem as many people
give it credit for. Many ways of designing a firewall put a packet
filtering router, built on a specialized, robust, and quickly
upgradeable TCP/IP implementation, in front of any general-purpose
computer in any case. In these designs, the router can offer some
protection to Windows NT machines. Windows NT's TCP/IP
implementation is also catching up rapidly, because problems with it
tend to be extremely visible (once somebody's crashed a few
hundred thousand hosts, people tend to take notice). It is painful to
have to upgrade the operating system on your firewall, and the
low-level TCP/IP is one of the most risky and painful parts to have
to upgrade, so changes that come out after your machines are
installed are not very comforting, but it is probable that most of
the worst problems have been found already.</p><p>





The second difficulty in securing Windows NT is more fundamental.
Windows NT is designed to be opaque; things are supposed to just work
without administrators knowing how they work. This simplifies the
process of setting up a machine, as long as you want to set it up to
do something expected. It vastly complicates the process of
evaluating the machine's security, setting it up to do
something unexpected (like run in a highly secure environment), or
modifying the way it behaves.</p><p>





Your average Windows NT machine looks less complex than your average
Unix machine but actually supports many more protocols. Unix machines
tend to provide a fairly straightforward set of TCP/IP services,
while Windows NT machines provide servers and/or clients for most of
those, plus support for multiple generations of Microsoft protocols,
and optional support for NetWare and AppleTalk. Go to your local
bookstore and look at the shelves of books for Windows NT compared to
the shelves of books for Unix. Some of the difference is in
popularity; some of the difference has to do with the economics of
certification; but a lot of the difference is that Windows NT is just
more complicated than Unix, and in security, complexity is bad.</p><p>





Unix administrators who complain about Windows NT's
complexities aren't merely ignorant (although the shock of
learning a new operating system does have something to do with it),
nor are they simply trying the wrong approach. Windows NT really is
extremely complicated and difficult to understand, and in a security
context, you do need to understand it. Trusting vendors to provide a
secure solution is not going to be satisfactory for a site of any
significant size.</p><p>





That doesn't mean Windows NT is entirely unsuited to building
firewalls. It may be complicated, but Unix isn't exactly
trivial. A firewall is not a good place to learn a new operating
system. Even commercial firewalls require some basic competency with
the operating system they run on, in order to secure the base
operating system and manage the software. If you're already
experienced in Windows NT, you're better off using it and
learning the previously hidden parts than trying to learn Unix from
scratch. If you're experienced in Unix, you are still going to
make stupid beginner mistakes trying to run Windows NT, even in a
prepackaged commercial firewall.</p><p>





If you find yourself stuck putting machines of the type you
don't understand into your firewall, don't panic. You can
survive the experience and come out of it with your security intact,
and you might as well do it with as much grace as possible. Expect it
to be difficult and confusing, and keep an open mind. You'll
need basic training on the operating system as well as this book,
which assumes that you are able to do normal administrative tasks
already.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.6.3. That's Not a Firewall!</h3>





The world is full of people eager to assure you that something is not
a firewall; it's "just a packet filter" or maybe
it's "better than a mere firewall". If it's
supposed to keep the bad guys out of your network, it's a
firewall. If it succeeds in keeping the bad guys out, while still
letting you happily use your network, it's a good firewall; if
it doesn't, it's a bad firewall. That's all there
is to it.</p><p>
