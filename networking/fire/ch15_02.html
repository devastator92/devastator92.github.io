<h2 class="sect1">15.2. HTTP Client Security</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1378" /> <a name="INDEX-1379" />The security problems of HTTP
clients are just as complex as those of HTTP servers. There are
several problems:</p><p>





<ul><li>Inadvertent release of information</p><p></li><li>Vulnerabilities in external viewers</p></li><li><p>Vulnerabilities in extension systems</p></li></ul>
<a name="ch15-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.2.1. Inadvertent Release of Information</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1380" />
<a name="INDEX-1381" />There are a number of ways in which web
browsers may give away information that you didn't intend to
make public. The most common is that they fail to protect passwords
and usernames in ways that you might expect. Many web pages pass
usernames and passwords around completely unprotected; some of them
even embed them into URLs, making it easy to accidentally store them
in your bookmarks file or mail them to a friend along with the
location of an interesting web page.
<a name="INDEX-1382" /></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1383" />
<a name="INDEX-1384" />
<a name="INDEX-1385" />The default
authentication for web pages is something called
<em class="emphasis">basic</em> <em class="emphasis">authentication</em>. This
is what's happening when you ask for a page, and instead of
bringing up the page, your web browser brings up a standard dialog
box that asks you for your username and password. There's no
encryption protecting that username and password; it's just
sent to the server in cleartext. Furthermore, if you ask for another
page from the same server, the username and password will be sent
again, without any warning, still unencrypted.</p><p>





A web site can protect the username and password data by telling the
browser to use HTTPS, instead of HTTP, to make the connection. (HTTPS
is discussed further later in this chapter.) This will encrypt the
entire communication, including the authentication information.
Unfortunately, you can't usually tell whether or not a web site
has done this; although there's a little lock icon to tell you
when the page you're looking at is encrypted, most clients
don't display it, or any other indication that things have been
secured, until the page actually loads, which is after you've
already given out the username and password.</p><p>





That's not the only way in which it's difficult to tell
what a web server is going to do with your password. You may be able
to tell if the web server is doing something extremely insecure, like
embedding the password in cleartext in a URL, but you can't
tell if it's storing it properly on the other end. Therefore,
while you can sometimes be sure that your password isn't
protected, you can never be sure that it is, and you should assume
that it isn't. Don't use passwords you've sent over
the Web to protect anything you care about deeply. You should use
different passwords on different web sites, and they should not be
the same passwords that you use anywhere else.</p><p>





If you're going to send a web site important data, you should
be sure that the site has made a legally binding commitment to
protect that data appropriately. You should also be sure that you
have an encrypted connection to the site.<a name="INDEX-1386" /></p><p>





<a name="ch15-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.2.1.1. Cookies</h3>





<em class="emphasis">Cookies</em><a name="INDEX-1387" /> are a
way for a site to track information about you. It can be information
that lasts a long time (for instance, information about what you want
to see when you come to the site) or information about what
you've just done (for instance, information about what items
you want to buy in the current transaction). Cookies are important
for web sites because it's otherwise extremely difficult to
keep track of anything about a web browser. Each time a browser
requests a page, it's a new transaction, with no way for the
server to know what previous transaction it might be related to.
Cookies provide a way for a server to ask a web browser to keep track
of and possibly store some data.</p><p>





A cookie is a fairly simple object; it's a small amount of
information to be stored that is associated with an identifying
string, an expiration date, and a URL pattern that indicates when the
cookie should be sent with HTTP requests. Whenever you visit a web
site, the browser checks to see if any unexpired cookies match the
URL pattern, and if so, the browser sends them along with your
request.</p><p>





The information that's in a cookie isn't usually of any
great interest by itself. Cookies tend to contain customer
identifiers or coded lists of preferences -- things that make
sense only to the site that set the cookie. This is important because
cookies are passed across the network unencrypted, and you
wouldn't want them to have anything dangerous in them.</p><p>





On the other hand, once a web site gets a cookie, it may give back
information that you do care about. For instance, it might use the
cookie to look up the credit card information you used on your last
order (in which case somebody with that cookie could order things on
your credit card). For that matter, it might just look up your last
order and display it along with your name. Since cookies are passed
unencrypted, and can be intercepted at any point, it's not good
practice to use them for anything critical, but some web sites do.</p><p>





In addition, many people are worried about situations in which
cookies can be used to track patterns of usage. When you use a link
on a web page, the site you go to gets information about the page the
link was on (this is called the <em class="emphasis">referrer</em>). If
the site you go to also has a cookie that will identify you, it can
build up a history of the places you have come from. This
wouldn't be very interesting for most sites, but sites that put
up banner advertisements have links on thousands of web pages and can
build up a fairly accurate picture of where you come from. Since
referrer information includes the entire URL, this will include
information about specific search requests and, in the worst cases,
may contain password and username information.</p><p>





There are some controls on the use of cookies. Some browsers
don't support cookies at all; others will allow you to control
the situations where you give out a cookie, by choosing to reject all
cookies, asking you before accepting cookies, or accepting only
certain cookies. For instance, cookies are intended to be returned
only to the site that set them, but the definition of
"site" is unclear. The cookie specifies what hostnames it
should be returned to and may give a specific hostname or a broad
range of hostnames. Some browsers can be configured so that they will
accept only cookies that will be returned to the host that originally
set the cookie.<a name="INDEX-1388" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.2.2. External Viewers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1389" /> <a name="INDEX-1390" />HTTP servers can provide data in any
number of formats: plain text files, HTML files, PostScript
documents, image files (PNG, JPEG, and GIF), movie files (MPEG),
audio files, and so on. The servers use MIME, discussed briefly in
<a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Electronic Mail and News"</a>, to format the data and specify its type.
HTTP clients generally don't attempt to understand and process
all of these different data formats. They understand some types (such
as HTML, plain text, JPEG, and GIF), and they rely on external
programs to deal with the rest. These external programs will display,
play, preview, print, or do whatever is appropriate for the format.</p><p>





For example, web browsers confronted with a PDF file will ordinarily
invoke Adobe Acrobat Exchange or Acrobat Reader, and web browsers
confronted with a compressed file will ordinarily invoke a
decompression program. The user controls (generally via a
configuration file) what data types the HTTP client knows about,
which programs to invoke for which data types, and what arguments to
pass to those programs. If the user hasn't provided a
configuration file, the HTTP client generally uses a built-in default
or a systemwide default.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1391" />These external
programs may be obviously separate from the web browser, or they may
be <em class="emphasis">plug-ins</em>, programs that are not part of the
web browser but that integrate with it seamlessly. Plug-ins are
simply external programs that can be run by the browser and will
display information in windows that the browser controls. There is
more than one type of plug-in technology; Microsoft's ActiveX
and Netscape's Plug-Ins can both be used to provide seamless
integration with a browser. Despite the fact that they look like
parts of the browser, they have the same security implications as
other external programs.</p><p>





All of these external programs present two security concerns:</p><p>





<ul><li>What are the inherent capabilities of the external programs an
attacker might take advantage of ?</p><p></li><li>What new programs (or new arguments for existing programs) might an
attacker be able to convince the user to add to the local
configuration?</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-1392" />Let's
consider, for example, what an HTTP client is going to do with a
PostScript file. PostScript is a language for controlling printers.
While primarily intended for that purpose, it is a full programming
language, complete with data structures, flow of control operators,
and file input/output operators. These operators ("read
file", "write file", "create file",
"delete file", etc.) are seldom used, except on printers
with local disks for font storage, but they're there as part of
the language. PostScript previewers (such as GhostScript) generally
implement these operators for completeness.</p><p>





Suppose that a user uses Internet Explorer to pull down a PostScript
document. Internet Explorer invokes GhostScript, and it turns out
that the document has PostScript commands in it that say
"delete all files in the current directory". If
GhostScript executes the commands, who's to blame? You
can't really expect Internet Explorer to scan the PostScript on
the way through to see if it's dangerous; that's an
impossible task. You can't really expect GhostScript not to do
what it's told in valid PostScript code. You can't really
expect your users not to download PostScript code or to scan it
themselves.</p><p>





Current versions of GhostScript have a safer mode they run in by
default. This mode disables "dangerous" operators such as
those for file input/output. But what about all the other PostScript
interpreters or previewers? And what about the applications to handle
all the other data types? How safe are they? Who knows?</p><p>





Even if you have safe versions of these auxiliary applications, how
do you keep your users from changing their configuration files to add
new applications, run different applications, or pass different
arguments (for example, to disable the safer mode of GhostScript) to
the existing applications?</p><p>





Why would a user do this? Suppose that the user found something on
the web that claimed to be something really neat  --  a game demo,
a graphics file, a copy of the hottest new song, whatever. And
suppose that this desirable something came with a note that said
"Hey, before you can access this Really Cool Thing, you need to
modify your browser configuration, because the standard configuration
doesn't know how to deal with this thing; here's what you
do. . . ." And suppose that the instructions were something
like "remove the `-dSAFER' flag from the
configuration for files of type PostScript"?</p><p>





Would your users recognize that they were being instructed to do
something dangerous? Even if they recognized it, would they do it
anyway (nice, trusting people that they are)?<a name="INDEX-1393" /></p><p>

<a name="ch15-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.2.3. Extension Systems</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1394" /> <a name="INDEX-1395" />Using
external viewers is not the only way to extend the capabilities of a
web browser. Most browsers also support at least one system that
allows web pages to download programs that will be executed by the
browser. A variety of different extension systems are supported by
different browsers, and they have very different security models and
implications. The details of the different systems are discussed in
<a href="ch15_04.html#ch15-45785">Section 15.4, "Mobile Code and Web-Related Languages"</a>,
later in this chapter. Even though the systems differ, they have a
certain number of goals and security implications in common.</p><p>





These extension systems are very convenient; it is often much more
efficient to have the browser do some calculations itself than to
have to send data to an HTTP server, have it do some calculations,
and get the answer back. In addition, extension languages allow for a
much more powerful and flexible interface between the browser and the
full capabilities of the computer than you can get by using external
viewers.</p><p>





For instance, if you are filling out a form, it's annoying to
have to submit the form to the server and wait for it to come back
and tell you that you've omitted a required piece of
information. It's preferable for your browser to be able to
tell you that immediately. Similarly, if your happiness depends on
having penguins dance across the screen, the most efficient way to
get that effect is going to be to tell your browser how to draw a
dancing penguin and where to move it.</p><p>





On the other hand, filling out forms and drawing dancing penguins are
not all that interesting. In order for extension languages to
actually do interesting and useful tasks, they have to have more
capabilities, but the more capabilities that are available, the more
dangerous a language is.</p><p>





Of course, normal programming languages have lots of capabilities and
therefore lots of dangers, but people don't usually find this
worrisome. This is because when you get a program written in a normal
programming language, you generally decide that you want the program,
you go out looking for it, you have some information about where it
comes from, and you explicitly choose to run it. When you get a
program as part of a web page, it just shows up and runs; you may be
happily watching the dancing penguins and not knowing that anything
else is happening.</p><p>





We discuss the different approaches taken by extension languages in
the following sections, as we discuss the specific languages. All of
them do attempt to provide security, but none of them is problem
free.<a name="INDEX-1396" />
<a name="INDEX-1397" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch15-11432" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.2.4. What Can You Do?</h3>





There is no simple, foolproof defense against the types of problems
we've described. At this point in time, you have to rely on a
combination of carefully installed and configured client and
auxiliary programs, and a healthy dose of user education and
awareness training. This is an area of active research and
development, and both the safeguards and the attacks will probably
develop significantly over the next couple of years.</p><p>





Content-aware firewalls, whether they are packet filters or proxies,
can be of considerable help in reducing client vulnerability. A
firewall that pays attention to content can control which extension
languages and which types of files are passed through; it is even
possible for it to do virus scanning on executables. Unfortunately,
it's not possible to do a truly satisfactory job of protection
even with a content-aware firewall.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1398" /> <a name="INDEX-1399" />Using
<em class="emphasis">content-based filtering,</em> you have two options;
you can filter out everything that might be dangerous, or you can
filter out only those things you know for certain are dangerous. In
the first case, you simply filter out all scripting languages; in the
second case, you filter out known attacks. Be cautious of products
that claim to filter out all hostile code and only hostile code.
Accurately determining what code is hostile by simply looking at the
code is impossible in the most specific, logical, and mathematical
sense of the term. For useful scripting languages, it is equivalent
to solving the Turing halting problem (determining whether an
arbitrary piece of code ever stops executing), and the proof that it
is impossible is one of the most famous and fundamental results in
theoretical computer science.</p><p>





It is possible to recognize particular pieces of hostile code, and
sometimes even to recognize patterns that are common to many pieces
of hostile code. Most content-based filtering systems rely on
recognizing known attacks. Any time somebody comes up with a new
attack, you will be vulnerable to it until the filter is updated,
which may of course be after you have been attacked. Many
content-based filters are easily fooled by trivial changes to the
attack. Content filters that try to remove only hostile code
fundamentally use the same technology as virus detectors. This has
the advantage that it's a well-understood problem for vendors,
who know about creating and distributing signatures. It has the
disadvantage that it's a well-understood problem for attackers,
as well, who have a variety of programs at their disposal for
permuting programs to change their signatures.</p><p>





Using content filtering to remove all scripting languages is safer.
Unfortunately, you really do need to remove all scripting languages,
since otherwise, it is possible to pass through JavaScript or
VBScript programs that create Java code or ActiveX controls. Many web
pages are difficult or impossible to use if you filter out all
scripting languages (and a significant percentage of them don't
detect the problem and are just mysteriously blank or nonfunctional).
In addition, using content filtering to remove scripting can
interfere with some of the methods that servers use to try to deal
with clients that don't support scripting languages. For
instance, some servers attempt to determine capabilities of the
client by the information the client provides about the browser
version, which doesn't provide any information about the filter
in the middle. Some pages may also try to use JavaScript to determine
if Java is available. This means that pages that work fine if
scripting languages are turned off at the browser may still fail
miserably when a filter removes the scripts.</p><p>





As we mention later, content filtering is impossible on some web
pages; connections made with HTTPS instead of with HTTP are
encrypted, and the firewall cannot tell what is in them to do content
filtering.<a name="INDEX-1400" /> <a name="INDEX-1401" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch15-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.2.5. Internet Explorer and Security Zones</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1402" /> <a name="INDEX-1403" />One way for a browser to improve its
security is to treat different sites differently. It's
reasonable to allow an internal web site to do more risky things than
an external one, for instance.</p><p>





Starting with Internet Explorer 4.0, Microsoft introduced the concept
of <em class="emphasis">security</em> <em class="emphasis">zones</em> to allow
you to configure your browser to do this. Explorer defines multiple
security zones and sets different default security policies for them.
For instance, there is a security zone for the intranet, which by
default accepts all signed ActiveX controls and asks you if you want
to allow each unsigned control, and one for the Internet, which by
default asks you if you want to accept each signed control and
rejects all unsigned controls. (ActiveX controls and signatures are
discussed later in this chapter.) There is also a security zone that
applies only to data originating on the local machine (this is not
supposed to include cached data that was originally loaded from the
Internet). The local machine zone is the most trusted zone.</p><p>





In most cases, Internet Explorer uses the host portion of the URL to
determine what zone a page is in. Because the different zones have
different security policies, it's important that Internet
Explorer get this right. However, there have been several problems
with the way that Internet Explorer does this, some of which
icrosoft has fixed and some of which are not fixable. In particular,
any hostname that does not contain a period is assumed to be in the
intranet zone. Originally, there were various ways of referring to
Internet hosts by IP address that could force any Internet host to be
treated as an intranet host. These problems have been removed, and
there is now no known way to write a link that will force Internet
Explorer to consider it part of the intranet zone.</p><p>





However, there are numerous ways for people to set themselves up so
that external hosts are considered intranet hosts, and the security
implications are unlikely to be clear to them. For instance, adding a
domain name to the Domain Suffix Search Order in DNS properties will
make all hosts in that domain parts of the intranet zone; for a less
sweeping effect, any host that's present in LMHOSTS or HOSTS
with a short name is also part of the intranet zone. An internal web
server that will act as an intermediary and retrieve external pages
will make all those pages parts of the intranet zone. The most
notable class of programs that do this sort of thing are translators,
like AltaVista's Babelfish (<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">http://babelfish.altavista.com</a>), which will
translate English to French, among other options, or RinkWorks'
Dialectizer (<a href="http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect">http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect</a>), which will
show you the page as if it were spoken by the cartoon character Elmer
Fudd, among other options.<a name="INDEX-1404" /> <a name="INDEX-1405" /><a name="INDEX-1406" /> <a name="INDEX-1407" /><a name="INDEX-1408" /> <a name="INDEX-1409" /><a name="INDEX-1410" /></p><p>
