<h2 class="sect1">8.4. Packet Filtering Tips and Tricks</h2>





<a name="INDEX-543" />Packet filtering systems are
complicated, and administering them has some subtlety. Here are some
ways to deal with them more effectively and make them more secure.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.1. Edit Your Filtering Rules Offline</h3>





<a name="INDEX-544" />The
filter-editing tools on most systems are usually pretty minimal.
Also, it's not always clear how new rules will interact with
existing rule sets. In particular, it's often difficult to
delete rules, or to add new rules in the middle of an existing rule
set.</p><p>





You might find it more convenient to keep your filters in a text file
on one of your Unix or PC systems, so that you can edit them there
with the tools you're familiar with, and then load the file on
the filtering system as if it contained commands you were typing at
the console. Different systems support various ways of doing this.
For example, on Cisco products, you can use TFTP to obtain command
files from a server. (Be careful of where you enable a TFTP server,
though. See the discussion of TFTP in <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>,
and think about using something like TCP Wrapper to control what
hosts can activate that TFTP server.)</p><p>





An added advantage of keeping the filters elsewhere as a file is that
you can keep comments in the file (stripping them out of the copy
sent to the router, if necessary). Most filtering systems discard any
comments in the commands they're given; if you later go look at
the active filters on the system, you'll find that the comments
aren't retained.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.2. Reload Rule Sets from Scratch Each Time</h3>





<a name="INDEX-545" />The first
thing the file should do is clear all the old rules, so that each
time you load the file you're rebuilding the rule set from
scratch; that way, you don't have to worry about how the new
rules will interact with the old. Next, specify the rules you want to
establish, followed by whatever commands are necessary to apply those
rules to the appropriate interfaces.</p><p>





When you clear the old filtering rules, many filtering systems will
default to allowing all packets through. If you have any problems
loading the new filtering rules, your filtering system could be
allowing everything through while you sort out the problems with the
new rules. Therefore, it's a good idea to temporarily disable
or shut down the external interface while you update filtering rules,
then re-enable it when you're done updating the rules. Make
sure that you aren't connecting to the filtering system and
doing the update through the external interface, or you'll cut
yourself off in mid-session when you shut down the external
interface.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.3. Replace Packet Filters Atomically</h3>





<a name="INDEX-546" />Sometimes you
want to update filtering rules without temporarily shutting off all
access (as was discussed previously). This is possible, as long as:</p><p>





<ul><li>Your packet filtering system allows you to identify a rule set and
then assign the rule set to an interface, replacing the rule set
previously assigned to the interface. (Some systems do not allow you
to identify rule sets; others do not allow you to assign a rule set
to an interface that already has one assigned.)</p><p></li><li>When a rule set assignment fails, the packet filtering system reverts
to the rule set previously in use. (Some systems will remove all
rules in this case, which is unsafe.)</p><p></li></ul>
If your system meets both of these conditions, you can update rules
with the following system:</p><p>





<ol><li>Load the new rules with an unused identifier.</p><p></li><li>Assign the new rules to the interface.</p></li><li><p>Verify that the new rules are in place and working correctly.</p></li><li><p>Delete the old rules.</p></li><li><p>In order to keep your configuration consistent, load the new rules
again with the original identifier and assign them to the interface
again. (This doesn't change the rule set, but it returns you to
your normal identifier.)</p><p></li><li>Update any offline copies of the configuration with the new rules.</p></li></ol>
It is possible to automate and script this process if copious and
very pessimistic error checking is performed.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.4. Always Use IP Addresses, Never Hostnames</h3>





<a name="INDEX-547" /> <a name="INDEX-548" />Always specify hosts and networks
in filtering rules by IP address, never by hostname or by network
name (if your filtering product even supports that). If you specify
filtering rules by hostname, your filtering could be subverted if
someone accidentally or intentionally corrupts the name-to-address
translation (e.g., by feeding false data to your DNS server).</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.5. Password Protect Your Packet Filters</h3>





<a name="INDEX-549" />Packet filtering
systems have to be configured, and many provide ways to do this
interactively over the network, perhaps using Telnet or SNMP. If the
packet filtering system is based upon a general-purpose computer,
then you should take the same remote access precautions as you would
when configuring a bastion host. For specialized packet filtering
systems, you should take very similar precautions. In particular, if
the system stores a master password, even if it is hashed, in a
configuration file and attackers can obtain that information, they
can use password-cracking tools to guess or break the password. Some
packet filtering systems have different password modes; be sure to
consult vendor documentation and use a mode that cannot be trivially
broken.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.6. If Possible, Use Named Access Lists</h3>





Some packet filtering systems allow names to be assigned to sets of
rules. In addition, these names may get included in log messages.
Using meaningful names can be very useful for both debugging and
parsing error log files.<a name="INDEX-550" /></p><p>
