<h2 class="sect1">12.3. Securing Windows NT</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1051" />
<a name="INDEX-1052" />Once you
have chosen a machine, you need to make sure that it has a reasonably
secure operating system installation. The first steps in this process
are the same as for any other operating system and were discussed in
<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>. They are:</p><p>





<ol><li>Start with a minimal clean operating system installation. Install the
operating system from scratch onto empty disks, selecting only the
subsystems you need.</p><p></li><li>Fix known bugs. Consult CERT-CC, Microsoft, your hardware vendor, and
any other sources of security information you may have to make
certain that you have all appropriate hot fixes and service packs
installed. (Note that you may need to reapply hot fixes and service
packs after you install software.)</p><p></li><li>Use a checklist to configure the system. Microsoft's security
web site, located at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security">http://www.microsoft.com/security</a>,provides
links for checklists.</p><p></li></ol>

<h3 class="sect2">12.3.1. Setting Up System Logs Under Windows NT</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1053" /> <a name="INDEX-1054" /><a name="INDEX-1055" />Under Windows NT, logging is done by the
Event Logger, and logs are read with the Event Viewer. This poses a
number of problems:</p><p>





<ul><li><a name="INDEX-1056" />The Event
Logger keeps information only locally and doesn't support
remote logging.</p><p></li><li>No way is provided to reduce the amount of information in the active
log automatically without destroying information.</p><p></li><li><a name="INDEX-1057" />The Event
Viewer doesn't provide a very flexible or powerful way of
looking at events.</p><p></li></ul>
By default, Windows NT keeps a log of a fixed size, and when the log
is full, old events are deleted to make room for new ones. This is
not a secure configuration; an attacker can create a lot of
unimportant events to force crucial ones to be removed from the log.
You'll notice that something's wrong, but you won't
know what.</p><p>





You can set up Windows NT so that it does not delete old items when
the log fills. However, if you do so, it will simply stop logging
items when the log fills, which is even worse for security. If
you're really confident about your ability to keep the log
small by hand, you can set the machine up so that if the log fills
up, it will not only stop logging, it will also shut the machine
down. This approach is very radical; it does not do a graceful
shutdown but simply crashes, probably losing information in open
files. On the other hand, as long as the machine isn't set to
autoboot, it will make sure that you don't lose logging
information.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1058" />
<a name="INDEX-1059" />If you are very
careful, you can get an Event Logger set up that is relatively secure
but that requires considerable maintenance. To do so, you'll
need to configure the Event Logger for a large log that does not
overwrite old events, have it shut down the machine if the log fills,
turn off autobooting, and then regularly save the log to removable
media and clear the logs. This still leaves you vulnerable to denial
of service attacks and to attackers who modify the logs before you
copy them. You can add some security by changing the location to
which Event Logger writes and putting the log on write-once media.</p><p>





To keep events from being overwritten, use the Event Viewer, go to
the Log menu, select Log Settings, and select Do Not Overwrite Events
(Clear Log Manually). To shut down the machine when the log fills up,
set the registry key</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\CrashOnAuditFail</pre></blockquote>





to 1. To change the location where files are stored, look in:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog</pre></blockquote>





You will find an entry for each of the three Windows NT logs
(application, system, and security), each of which has a key named
"File". Change the value of this key to change the files
used to store event logs.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1060" />You are
better advised to use an add-on product to copy events out of the
Event Logger as they are logged. You can then let old events be
deleted, since you'll be working from the other copies.
icrosoft sells a program that turns events into SNMP traps as they
are logged as part of the System Management Service; you can also get
programs that will make <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> entries for
events (see <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, for more information about
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em>). The Windows NT Resource Kit provides a
utility called <em class="emphasis">dumpel</em> that will dump the event
log to a text file, which can also be handy for saving event log
information. None of these systems are perfect; they have a
significant risk of losing or duplicating events. You will therefore
want to protect the original event logs as well.</p><p>





Although Microsoft does not provide tools for rotating event logs,
there is a programming interface to the event logger that would allow
you to write your own. If you do this, you should still leave the
machine set to crash when the log fills, so that you are protected in
case of rotation problems.</p><p>





You will also want to be careful about the amount of logging you do.
Logging takes a significant amount of effort under Windows NT, and
logging large numbers of events can noticeably slow down a server,
particular if you are running add-on software that requires every
event to be logged twice. The auditing system can log immense amounts
of data if you are incautious about what you turn on.<a name="INDEX-1061" /> <a name="INDEX-1062" /> <a name="INDEX-1063" /> <a name="INDEX-1064" /> <a name="INDEX-1065" /></p><p>
