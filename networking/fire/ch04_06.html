<h2 class="sect1">4.6. IP Version 6</h2>





<a name="INDEX-317" />The current version of IP (as we write)
is officially known as IP Version 4; throughout this book, whenever
we talk about IP with no further qualification, that's what
we're talking about. There is, however, a new version of IP in
the works right now, known as IP Version 6 (IPv6 for short). Why do
we need a new version of IP, and how will IPv6 affect you?</p><p>





The impetus to create IPv6 was one simple problem: the Internet is
running out of IP addresses. The Internet has become so popular that
there just won't be enough IP network numbers (particularly
Class B network numbers, which have proven to be what most sites
need) to go around; by some estimates, if nothing had been done, the
Internet would have run out of addresses in 1995 or 1996.
Fortunately, the problem was recognized, and something was done. Two
things, actually  --  first, the implementation of a set of
temporary measures and guidelines to make best possible use of the
remaining unassigned addresses, and second, the design and
implementation of a new version of IP that would permanently deal
with the address exhaustion issue.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-318" />If
you're going to create a new version of IP in order to deal
with address-space exhaustion, you might as well take advantage of
the opportunity to deal with a whole raft of other problems or
limitations in IP as well, such as encryption, authentication, source
routing, and dynamic configuration. (For many people, these
limitations are the primary reasons for IPv6, and the addressing
problem is merely a handy reason for other people to accept it.) This
produces a number of implications for firewalls. According to Steve
Bellovin of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, a well-known firewalls expert
and a participant in the IPv6 design process:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-11">[11]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-11" />[11]Steve
Bellovin, posting to the Firewalls mailing list, 31 December
1994.</p><p>




</blockquote>






<a name="INDEX-319" />IPv6 is based on the concept of nested
headers. That's how encryption and authentication are done; the
"next protocol" field after the IPv6 header specifies an
encryption or an authentication header. In turn, their next protocol
fields would generally indicate either IPv6 or one of the usual
transport protocols, such as TCP or UDP.</p><p>





Nested IP over IP can be done even without encryption or
authentication; that can be used as a form of source routing. A more
efficient way is to use the source routing header  --  which is
more useful than the corresponding IPv4 option, and is likely to be
used much more, especially for mobile IP.</p><p>





Some of the implications for firewalls are already apparent. A packet
filter must follow down the full chain of headers, understanding and
processing each one in turn. (And yes, this can make looking at port
numbers more expensive.) A suitably cautious stance dictates that a
packet with an unknown header be bounced, whether inbound or
outbound. Also, the ease and prevalence of source routing means that
cryptographic authentication is absolutely necessary. On the other
hand, it is intended that such authentication be a standard,
mandatory feature. Encrypted packets are opaque, and hence
can't be examined; this is true today, of course, but there
aren't very many encryptors in use now. That will change. Also
note that encryption can be done host-to-host, host-to-gateway, or
gateway-to-gateway, complicating the analysis still more.</p><p>





Address-based filtering will also be affected, to some extent, by the
new autoconfiguration mechanisms. It's vital that any host
whose address is mentioned in a filter receive the same address each
time. While this is the intent of the standard mechanisms, one needs
to be careful about proprietary schemes, dial-up servers, etc. Also,
high-order address bits can change, to accommodate the combination of
provider-based addressing and easy switching among carriers.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-320" />Finally, IPv6
incorporates "flows." Flows are essentially virtual
circuits at the IP level; they're intended to be used for
things like video, intermediate-hop ATM circuit selection, etc. But
they can also be used for firewalls, given appropriate
authentication: the UDP reply problem might go away if the query had
a flow id that was referenced by the response. This, by the way, is a
vague idea of mine; there are no standards for how this should be
done. The regular flow setup protocol won't work; it's
too expensive. But a firewall traversal header might do the job.</p><p>






As you can see, IPv6 could have a major impact on firewalls,
especially with respect to packet filtering. However, IPv6 is not
being deployed rapidly. The address exhaustion problem doesn't
seem to be as bad as people had feared (under many estimates, the
address space ought to have been gone before this edition made it to
press). On the other hand, the problem of converting networks from
IPv4 to IPv6 has turned out to be worse. The end result is that while
IPv6 is still a viable technology that is gaining ground, it's
not going to take over from IPv4 in the immediate future;
you're going to need an IPv4 firewall for quite some time.</p><p>
