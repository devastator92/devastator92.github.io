<h2 class="sect1">17.4. File Sharing for Microsoft Networks </h2>





<a name="INDEX-1680" />
<a name="INDEX-1681" />
<a name="INDEX-1682" />A
number of protocols are involved in file sharing on Microsoft
networks, and you will hear a significant number of names thrown
around. The most recent and most standard is the Common Internet File
System (CIFS), which is based on Server Message Block (SMB).
Officially, CIFS is an SMB-based standard that extends
icrosoft's current practice for using SMB; in practical terms,
it's simply a new name for SMB. You will also see people refer
to file sharing for Microsoft networks as SMB or SMB file sharing.
Despite the word "file" in the name, CIFS, like SMB,
provides a wide variety of features, not limited to file sharing.
These are discussed further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1683" />
<a name="INDEX-1684" />
<a name="INDEX-1685" />
<a name="INDEX-1686" />
<a name="INDEX-1687" />
<a name="INDEX-1688" />You'll also see people using terms
like "NetBEUI", "NetBIOS",
"NetBT", or "LanManager" as if they were file
sharing protocols. NetBEUI is a networking protocol used on local
area networks; it operates at the same level that IP does. NetBIOS is
a higher-level networking protocol originally run on top of NetBEUI.
NetBT is a TCP/IP implementation of NetBIOS; a program that uses
NetBIOS can use either normal NetBIOS over NetBEUI or NetBT over
TCP/IP, without needing to know what's going on. LanManager is
an older Microsoft protocol suite, still supported by SMB file
sharing and CIFS in compatibility modes. All of these protocols tend
to come together; normally, if you run SMB, you also run NetBIOS (in
which case you must run either NetBEUI or NetBT), and if you run
NetBIOS, you also run SMB, which is why there is so much confusion
about which does what. These days, the association is getting looser
(in particularly, running CIFS directly over TCP/IP is supported in
Windows 2000). <a href="ch17_04.html#ch17-27716">Figure 17-3</a> shows the protocol stack
normally involved in running CIFS over TCP/IP.</p><p>





<a name="ch17-27716" /><div class="figure"><img height="95" alt="Figure 17-3" src="figs/fire2.1703.gif" width="300" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 17-3. The CIFS protocol stack</h4>

CIFS file sharing is usually used with other members of a large
protocol family and frequently is capable of using multiple different
methods of achieving a given end. See <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>,
for information about WINS and NetBT Name Service, which are often
used with CIFS. <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, discusses the user
authentication protocols used with CIFS.</p><p>





It is almost impossible to separate file sharing from the other
services supported by SMB. CIFS is not actually a new protocol but
simply a new name for a way of using SMB. As such, it provides all
the capabilities of SMB, including a number of capabilities that are
not normally thought of as part of a filesystem, including messaging,
print service, and multiple methods of doing general-purpose
transaction processing. This makes it much more risky than dedicated
file sharing protocols.</p><p>





It is worth noting that although the extra features in CIFS make it
more risky than NFS, it does at least usually provide better
authentication. CIFS filesystem transactions require the user to
authenticate, instead of relying on the client host to provide user
identification, the way most NFS servers do. CIFS can also provide
message authentication to protect from hijacking. It does not provide
data encryption, however.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.4.1. Samba</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1689" />The most
popular program that provides SMB services on Unix machines is Samba,
which is best known for its support of file services. It is an open
source program, implemented without Microsoft's cooperation.
Because Microsoft does not release details of all of their protocols,
Samba is the source of the most detailed information about how SMB
and related services actually work, as well as being one of the major
tools used for Unix-NT integration. Historically, Microsoft relied
upon their control of SMB clients for some of their security, and SMB
servers were highly vulnerable to badly behaved clients (whether
these were actively hostile or merely buggy). This led to
icrosoft's denouncing Samba, the first widely available client
that Microsoft did not control, as a "hacking tool"
because it revealed weaknesses that had not previously been
important. In fact, this is neither the purpose that Samba was
designed for nor its most common use (although it is true that some
people have modified Samba source code to use it to attack systems).
However, it is nice to note that since Samba became widespread,
icrosoft has significantly improved the security of its SMB servers.</p><p>





The base of Samba is a file server; in order to effectively provide
file service from a Unix machine without a Microsoft support
structure, it also includes a WINS server and a browser server and is
capable of acting as a domain controller to do user authentication.
SMB clients are available for Linux and some Unix operating systems,
and although they are not actually part of Samba, they are often
distributed with Samba.</p><p>





Samba itself is both more robust and more secure than most SMB file
servers. Admittedly, much of its security derives from the fact that
it doesn't offer all of the services you would get from an
equivalent server on a Microsoft operating system (for instance,
there's no need to worry about people using a Samba server to
remotely access the Performance Monitor or the User Manager). Most
security problems with Samba are caused by the fact that it bridges
the Unix and Microsoft world and is often managed by people who are
naive about one of the two. Samba provides authentication and file
service and can give away all of your authentication information and
files if you configure it incorrectly, just like any other program
that provides these services. If you configure it poorly, you will
not be protected just because it uses Microsoft protocols that are
supposed to have well-behaved clients, and you should not blame
unfortunate results on either Samba or Microsoft.<a name="INDEX-1690" /></p><p>

<a name="ch17-18-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.4.2. Distributed File System (Dfs)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1691" /> <a name="INDEX-1692" />Microsoft provides a system called the
Distributed File System (Dfs<a href="#FOOTNOTE-76">[76]</a>) that provides
clients with a unified interface to multiple file servers. A Dfs
server exports something that appears to be a standard directory
structure, but which may contain files from many file servers. Dfs
also allows you to have multiple servers with replicas of a file, and
have clients balanced between the servers and rerouted if a server
fails.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-76" />[76]Microsoft appears to
prefer the capitalization "Dfs" instead of the more
traditional "DFS".</p><p>




</blockquote>





Dfs has been available for some time but is first becoming a standard
part of installations in Windows 2000. Dfs is not actually a separate
file sharing protocol. Instead, it uses standard file sharing
protocols for actual file access (usually, this means CIFS, but a
client can use any file sharing protocol it has available). Dfs
clients use RPC to get information from a Dfs server about where to
look for actual files.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.4.3. Packet Filtering, Proxying, and Network Address Translation Characteristics of Microsoft File Sharing</h3>





icrosoft file sharing is based on CIFS, and the packet filtering,
proxying, and network address translation characteristics of CIFS are
discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>. Dfs is based on CIFS and on
RPC (RPC is also discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>).
Depending on your network and your needs, a full file sharing
environment may also require any or all of WINS, the Browser, and
domain authentication. WINS and the Browser are discussed in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>, while domain authentication is discussed in
<a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>.<a name="INDEX-1693" /> <a name="INDEX-1694" /> <a name="INDEX-1695" /></p><p>
