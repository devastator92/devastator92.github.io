<h2 class="sect1">1.5. What Is an Internet Firewall?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-52" /><a name="INDEX-53" /><a name="INDEX-54" /><a name="INDEX-55" />As we've mentioned, firewalls are a very effective type of network
security. This section briefly describes what Internet firewalls can
do for your overall site security. <a href="ch05_01.html#ch05-1614">Section 5.1, "Some Firewall Definitions"</a> and
<a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Firewall Design"</a> define the firewall terms used in this
book and describe the various types of firewalls in use today, and
the other chapters in <a href="part2.html">Part II, "Building Firewalls"</a> and those in
<a href="part3.html">Part III, "Internet Services"</a> describe the
details of building those firewalls.</p><p>





In building construction, a firewall is designed to keep a fire from
spreading from one part of the building to another. In theory, an
Internet firewall serves a similar purpose: it prevents the dangers
of the Internet from spreading to your internal network. In practice,
an Internet firewall is more like a moat of a medieval castle than a
firewall in a modern building. It serves multiple purposes:</p><p>





<ul><li>It restricts people to entering at a carefully controlled point.</p><p></li><li>It prevents attackers from getting close to your other defenses.</p></li><li><p>It restricts people to leaving at a carefully controlled point.</p></li></ul>
An Internet firewall is most often installed at the point where your
protected internal network connects to the Internet, as shown in
<a href="ch01_05.html#ch01-528">Figure 1-1</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-528" /><div class="figure"><img height="217" alt="Figure 1-1" src="figs/fire2.0101.gif" width="475" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 1-1. A firewall usually separates an internal network from the Internet</h4>

All traffic coming from the Internet or going out from your internal
network passes through the firewall. Because the traffic passes
through it, the firewall has the opportunity to make sure that this
traffic is acceptable.</p><p>





What does "acceptable" mean to the firewall? It means
that whatever is being done -- email, file transfers, remote
logins, or any kinds of specific interactions between specific
systems  --  conforms to the security policy of the site. Security
policies are different for every site; some are highly restrictive
and others fairly open, as we'll discuss in <a href="ch25_01.html">Chapter 25, "Security Policies"</a>.</p><p>





Logically, a firewall is a separator, a restricter, an analyzer. The
physical implementation of the firewall varies from site to site.
ost often, a firewall is a set of hardware components  --  a
router, a host computer, or some combination of routers, computers,
and networks with appropriate software. There are various ways to
configure this equipment; the configuration will depend upon a
site's particular security policy, budget, and overall
operations.</p><p>





A firewall is very rarely a single physical object, although some
commercial products attempt to put everything into the same box.
Usually, a firewall has multiple parts, and some of these parts may
do other tasks besides function as part of the firewall. Your
Internet connection is almost always part of your firewall. Even if
you have a firewall in a box, it isn't going to be neatly
separable from the rest of your site; it's not something you
can just drop in.</p><p>





We've compared a firewall to the moat of a medieval castle, and
like a moat, a firewall is not invulnerable. It doesn't protect
against people who are already inside; it works best if coupled with
internal defenses; and, even if you stock it with alligators, people
sometimes manage to swim across. A firewall is also not without its
drawbacks; building one requires significant expense and effort, and
the restrictions it places on insiders can be a major annoyance.</p><p>





Given the limitations and drawbacks of firewalls, why would anybody
bother to install one? Because a firewall is the most effective way
to connect a network to the Internet and still protect that network.
The Internet presents marvelous opportunities. Millions of people are
out there exchanging information. The benefits are obvious: the
chances for publicity, customer service, and information gathering.
The popularity of the information superhighway is increasing
everybody's desire to get out there. The risks should also be
obvious: any time you get millions of people together, you get crime;
it's true in a city, and it's true on the Internet. Any
superhighway is fun only while you're in a car. If you have to
live or work by the highway, it's loud, smelly, and dangerous.</p><p>





How can you benefit from the good parts of the Internet without being
overwhelmed by the bad? Just as you'd like to drive on a
highway without suffering the nasty effects of putting a freeway
off-ramp into your living room, you need to carefully control the
contact that your network has to the Internet. A firewall is a tool
for doing that, and in most situations, it's the single most
effective tool for doing that.</p><p>





There are other uses of firewalls. For example, they can be used to
divide parts of a site from each other when these parts have distinct
security needs (and we'll discuss these uses in passing, as
appropriate). The focus of this book, however, is on firewalls as
they're used between a site and the Internet.</p><p>





Firewalls offer significant benefits, but they can't solve
every security problem. The following sections briefly summarize what
firewalls can and cannot do to protect your systems and your
data.<a name="INDEX-56" /></p><p>





<a name="ch01-541" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.1. What Can a Firewall Do?</h3>





Firewalls can do a lot for your site's security. In fact, some
advantages of using firewalls extend even beyond security, as
described in the sections that follow.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-544" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.1. A firewall is a focus for security decisions</h3>





<a name="INDEX-57" />Think of a firewall as a choke point. All
traffic in and out must pass through this single, narrow choke point.
A firewall gives you an enormous amount of leverage for network
security because it lets you concentrate your security measures on
this choke point: the point where your network connects to the
Internet.</p><p>





Focusing your security in this way is far more efficient than
spreading security decisions and technologies around, trying to cover
all the bases in a piecemeal fashion. Although firewalls can cost
tens of thousands of dollars to implement, most sites find that
concentrating the most effective security hardware and software at
the firewall is less expensive and more effective than other security
measures  --  and certainly less expensive than having inadequate
security.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-551" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.2. A firewall can enforce a security policy</h3>





any of the services that people want from the Internet are
inherently insecure. The firewall is the traffic cop for these
services. It enforces the site's security policy, allowing only
"approved" services to pass through and those only within
the rules set up for them.</p><p>





For example, one site's management may decide that certain
services are simply too risky to be used across the firewall, no
matter what system tries to run them or what user wants them. The
firewall will keep potentially dangerous services strictly inside the
firewall. (There, they can still be used for insiders to attack each
other, but that's outside of the firewall's control.)
Another site might decide that only one internal system can
communicate with the outside world. Still another site might decide
to allow access from all systems of a certain type, or belonging to a
certain group. The variations in site security policies are endless.</p><p>





A firewall may be called upon to help enforce more complicated
policies. For example, perhaps only certain systems within the
firewall are allowed to transfer files to and from the Internet; by
using other mechanisms to control which users have access to those
systems, you can control which users have these capabilities.
Depending on the technologies you choose to implement your firewall,
a firewall may have a greater or lesser ability to enforce such
policies.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-558" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.3. A firewall can log Internet activity efficiently</h3>





<a name="INDEX-58" /><a name="INDEX-59" /><a name="INDEX-60" /><a name="INDEX-61" />Because all traffic passes
through the firewall, the firewall provides a good place to collect
information about system and network use  --  and misuse. As a
single point of access, the firewall can record what occurs between
the protected network and the external network.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-575" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.4. A firewall limits your exposure</h3>





Although this point is most relevant to the use of internal
firewalls, which we describe in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Firewall Architectures"</a>,
it's worth mentioning here. Sometimes, a firewall will be used
to keep one section of your site's network separate from
another section. By doing this, you keep problems that impact one
section from spreading through the entire network. In some cases,
you'll do this because one section of your network may be more
trusted than another; in other cases, because one section is more
sensitive than another. Whatever the reason, the existence of the
firewall limits the damage that a network security problem can do to
the overall network.</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-579" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.2. What Can't a Firewall Do?</h3>





Firewalls offer excellent protection against network threats, but
they aren't a complete security solution. Certain threats are
outside the control of the firewall. You need to figure out other
ways to protect against these threats by incorporating physical
security, host security, and user education into your overall
security plan. Some of the weaknesses of firewalls are discussed in
the sections that follow.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-582" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.2.1. A firewall can't protect you against malicious insiders</h3>





A firewall might keep a system user from being able to send
proprietary information out of an organization over a network
connection; so would simply not having a network connection. But that
same user could copy the data onto disk, tape, or paper and carry it
out of the building in his or her briefcase.</p><p>





If the attacker is already inside the firewall  --  if the fox is
inside the henhouse  --  a firewall can do virtually nothing for
you. Inside users can steal data, damage hardware and software, and
subtly modify programs without ever coming near the firewall. Insider
threats require internal security measures, such as host security and
user education. Such topics are beyond the scope of this book.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-586" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.2.2. A firewall can't protect you against connections that don't go through it</h3>





A firewall can effectively control the traffic that passes through
it; however, there is nothing a firewall can do about traffic that
doesn't pass through it. For example, what if the site allows
dial-in access to internal systems behind the firewall? The firewall
has absolutely no way of preventing an intruder from getting in
through such a modem.</p><p>





Sometimes, technically expert users or system administrators set up
their own "back doors" into the network (such as a
dial-up modem connection), either temporarily or permanently, because
they chafe at the restrictions that the firewall places upon them and
their systems. The firewall can do nothing about this. It's
really a people-management problem, not a technical problem.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-590" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.2.3. A firewall can't protect against completely new threats</h3>





A firewall is designed to protect against known threats. A
well-designed one may also protect against some new threats. (For
example, by denying any but a few trusted services, a firewall will
prevent people from setting up new and insecure services.) However,
no firewall can automatically defend against every new threat that
arises. People continuously discover new ways to attack, using
previously trustworthy services, or using attacks that simply
hadn't occurred to anyone before. You can't set up a
firewall once and expect it to protect you forever. (See <a href="ch26_01.html">Chapter 26, "Maintaining Firewalls"</a> for advice on keeping your firewall up to
date.)</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-594" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.2.4. A firewall can't fully protect against viruses</h3>





<a name="INDEX-62" /><a name="INDEX-63" />Firewalls can't keep computer
viruses out of a network. It's true that all firewalls scan
incoming traffic to some degree, and some firewalls even offer virus
protection. However, firewalls don't offer very good virus
protection.</p><p>





Detecting a virus in a random packet of data passing through a
firewall is very difficult; it requires:</p><p>





<ul><li>Recognizing that the packet is part of a program</p><p></li><li>Determining what the program should look like</p></li><li><p>Determining that a change in the program is because of a virus</p></li></ul>
Even the first of these is a challenge. Most firewalls are protecting
machines of multiple types with different executable formats. A
program may be a compiled executable or a script (e.g., a Unix shell
script or a Microsoft batch file), and many machines support
multiple, compiled executable types. Furthermore, most programs are
packaged for transport and are often compressed as well. Packages
being transferred via email or Usenet news will also have been
encoded into ASCII in different ways.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-64" />For
all of these reasons, users may end up bringing viruses behind the
firewall, no matter how secure that firewall is. Even if you could do
a perfect job of blocking viruses at the firewall, however, you still
haven't addressed the virus problem. You've done nothing
about the other sources of viruses: software downloaded from dial-up
bulletin-board systems, software brought in on floppies from home or
other sites, and even software that comes pre-infected from
manufacturers are just as common as virus-infected software on the
Internet. Whatever you do to address those threats will also address
the problem of software transferred through the firewall.</p><p>





The most practical way to address the virus problem is through
host-based virus protection software, and user education concerning
the dangers of viruses and precautions to take against them.
<a name="INDEX-65" /><a name="INDEX-66" />Virus filtering on the
firewall may be a useful adjunct to this sort of precaution, but it
will never completely solve the problem.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.2.5. A firewall can't set itself up correctly</h3>





Every firewall needs some amount of configuration. Every site is
slightly different, and it's just not possible for a firewall
to magically work correctly when you take it out of the box. Correct
configuration is absolutely essential. A misconfigured firewall may
be providing only the illusion of security. There's nothing
wrong with illusions, as long as they're confusing the other
side. A burglar alarm system that consists entirely of some
impressive warning stickers and a flashing red light can actually be
effective, as long as you don't believe that there's
anything else going on. But you know better than to use it on network
security, where the warning stickers and the flashing red light are
going to be invisible. Unfortunately, many people have firewalls that
are in the end no more effective than that, because they've
been configured with fundamental problems. A firewall is not a
magical protective device that will fix your network security
problems no matter what you do with it, and treating it as if it is
such a device will merely increase your risk.</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.3. What's Wrong with Firewalls?</h3>





There are two main arguments against using firewalls:</p><p>





<ul><li>Firewalls interfere with the way the Internet is supposed to work,
introducing all sorts of problems, annoying users, and slowing down
the introduction of new Internet services.</p><p></li><li>The problems firewalls don't deal with (internal threats and
external connections that don't go through the firewall) are
more important than the problems they do deal with.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="ch01-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.3.1. Firewalls interfere with the Internet</h3>





It's true that the Internet is based on a model of end-to-end
communication, where individual hosts talk to each other. Firewalls
interrupt that end-to-end communication in a variety of ways. Most of
the problems that are introduced are the same sorts of problems that
are introduced by any security measure. Things are slowed down;
things that you want to get through can't; it's hard to
introduce changes. Having badge readers on doors introduces the same
sorts of problems (you have to swipe the badge and wait for the door
to open; when your friends come to meet you they can't get in;
new employees have to get badges). The difference is that on the
Internet there's a political and emotional attachment to the
idea that information is supposed to flow freely and change is
supposed to happen rapidly. People are much less willing to accept
the sorts of restrictions that they're accustomed to in other
environments.</p><p>





Furthermore, it's truly very annoying to have side effects.
There are a number of ways of doing things that provide real
advantages and are limited in their spread by firewalls, despite the
fact that they aren't security problems. For instance,
broadcasting audio and video over the Internet is much easier if you
can use multiple simultaneous connections, and if you can get quite
precise information about the capabilities of the destination host
and the links between you and it. However, firewalls have difficulty
managing the connections, they intentionally conceal some information
about the destination host, and they unintentionally destroy other
information. If you're trying to develop new ways of
interacting over the Internet, firewalls are incredibly frustrating;
everywhere you turn, there's something cool that TCP/IP is
supposed to be able to do that just doesn't work in the real
world. It's no wonder that application developers hate
firewalls.</p><p>





Unfortunately, they don't have any better suggestions for how
to keep the bad guys out. Think how many marvelous things you could
have if you didn't have to lock your front door to keep
strangers out; you wouldn't have to sit at home waiting for the
repairman or for a package to be delivered, just as a start. The need
for security is unavoidable in our world, and it limits what we can
do, in annoying ways. The development of the Internet has not changed
human nature.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.3.2. Firewalls don't deal with the real problem</h3>





You also hear people say that firewalls are the wave of the past
because they don't deal with the real problems. It's true
that firewall or no firewall, intruders get in, secret data goes out,
and bad things happen. At sites with really good firewalls, these
things occur by avoiding the firewalls. At sites that don't
have really good firewalls, these things may go on through the
firewalls. Either way, you can argue that this shows that firewalls
don't solve the problem.</p><p>





It's perfectly true, firewalls won't solve your security
problem. Once again, the people who point this out don't really
have anything better to offer. Protecting individual hosts works for
some sites and will help the firewall almost anywhere; detecting and
dealing with attacks via network monitoring, once again, will work
for some problems and will help a firewall almost anywhere.
That's basically the entire list of available alternatives. If
you look closely at most of the things promoted as being
"better than firewalls", you'll discover that
they're lightly disguised firewalls marketed by people with
restrictive definitions of what a firewall is.</p><p>
