<h2 class="sect1">7.3. Put Everything Together</h2>





Once you have determined what the basic components of your firewall
are, an unfortunate number of details still have to be determined.
You need to figure out how you're actually going to assemble
the pieces, and how you're going to provide the support
services that will keep them functioning.</p><p>





<a name="ch07-18-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.3.1. Where will logs go, and how?</h3>





<a name="INDEX-494" />Logging is extremely
important for a firewall. The logs are your best hope of detecting
attacks against your site and your best source of information about
what happened when an attack succeeds. You will need to keep logs
separate from the firewall, where an intruder can't destroy the
logs as soon as he or she compromises the firewall. If you have a
firewall composed of multiple machines, or you have multiple
firewalls, you'll also want to bring all of the logs together
to simplify the process of using them. Logging is discussed further
in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, and <a href="ch26_01.html">Chapter 26, "Maintaining Firewalls"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch07-19-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.3.1.1. How will you back up the system?</h3>





<a name="INDEX-495" />You will need to
keep backups of all the parts of your firewalls. These will let you
rebuild systems in an emergency, and they will also give you evidence
when you discover an attack, allowing you to compare before and after
states.</p><p>





Unfortunately, when you do backups between two machines, they become
vulnerable to each other. The machine that you use for backing up
your firewall is part of the firewall and needs to be treated
appropriately. You may find it more appropriate to do local backups,
with a device that's attached to each computer that makes up
part of the firewall (be sure to use removable media and remove it;
otherwise, a disaster or compromise will take the backups along with
the originals). If you have a large and complex firewall, you may
want to add a dedicated backup system to the firewall. This system
should be part of the firewall system, treated like any other bastion
host. It should not have access to internal networks or data, and it
should be secured like other bastion hosts.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-20-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.3.1.2. What support services does the system require?</h3>





You should carefully examine all cases where the firewall is getting
information from external machines, get rid of as many dependencies
as possible, and move other services into the firewall wherever
possible.</p><p>





For instance, is the firewall dependent on other machines for name
service? If so, interfering with the name service may cause problems
with the firewall (even if the firewall only uses name service to
write hostnames into logs, problems with the name service can make it
unusably slow). If you can, configure firewall machines so that they
never use name service for any purpose; if you can't, protect
your name server as part of your firewall (though you will still be
vulnerable to forged name service packets).</p><p>





Similarly, if you are using a time service to synchronize clocks on
firewall machines, it should use authentication and come from a
protected source. Firewall machines should not require or accept
routing updates unless they can be authenticated and their sources
protected.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-21-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.3.1.3. How will you access the machines?</h3>





You will need to do some routine maintenance tasks on the machines
(upgrade them, change configurations, add or remove user accounts,
reboot them). Are you going to physically go to the machines to do
this, or will you use some kind of remote access? If you're
going to do it remotely, how are you going to do it securely? <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, and <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Windows NT and Windows 2000 Bastion Hosts "</a>, discuss
remote administration options for Unix and Windows NT.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-22-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.3.1.4. Where will routine reports go, and how?</h3>





You will need some sort of reporting on the machine, so that you know
it's still functioning normally. Exactly what you need will
depend on the administration infrastructure that you have in place,
but you will need some way of getting regular log summaries and
reports from security auditing systems. You may also want to use a
monitoring system that will show you status on a regular basis.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch07-23-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.3.1.5. Where will alarms go, and how?</h3>





When things go wrong, the firewall should send emergency
notifications. The mechanism that is used should be one that
attackers can't easily interfere with. For instance, if the
firewall machines need to send network traffic to provide emergency
notification, it's easy for an attacker to simply take down the
network interface. (In some configurations, this may also remove the
attacker's access, but if the attack is a denial of service,
that isn't important.) Either machines should have ways of
sending alarms that are not dependent on the network (for instance,
by using a modem), or alarms should be generated by independent
monitoring machines that are not on the same network and will produce
alarms if they lose contact. <a name="INDEX-496" /></p><p>
