<h2 class="sect1">23.2. Games</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2170" /> <a name="INDEX-2171" />Internet games are a lot of fun.
Unfortunately, game designers are rarely security experts, and many
of the same people who attack computer systems are attracted to
Internet games. That's not to say that Internet gamers are
inherently bad people; most of them are fine upstanding citizens. On
the other hand, the primary audience for Internet shoot-em-ups is the
same crowd of adolescents with computers and free time that attackers
come from, and it would be a miracle if there weren't a lot of
overlap between the two cultures. If you take an application that
wasn't designed for security, put it on a network, and hand it
over to people who like to attack computer systems, the result is
predictable and not very pretty.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-2172" />Furthermore, the
design constraints for Internet games in general make easy-to-secure
connections undesirable. Persistent TCP connections to known ports
are just not suitable for most game-playing situations.
Well-documented protocols are easier for players to interfere with,
which game manufacturers rarely want, and in any case, game
manufacturers are generally busy turning out documentation for users
who just bought their first computer, and the manufacturers
don't have much time to spare to document technical details so
people can configure firewalls. (The most common firewall advice in
game documentation is "You must not be behind a
firewall.")</p><p>





It is impossible to document the firewall characteristics of games in
any detail. Games go in and out of favor rapidly, and even those that
are persistent favorites change frequently. For instance, knowing
that you want to play Quake doesn't predict what ports or even
what protocols you will need; some versions of Quake require both TCP
and UDP, while others use only one or the other.</p><p>





A networked game is always a client, usually of a protocol with
unknown features and security implications. One that can be a
controller for a multiplayer game is a server of some sort as well.
any games always provide both client and server features when they
are running in a multiplayer mode. This means that running networked
games may create vulnerabilities even if you do not connect to
external players (if the game brings up a server, that server may be
vulnerable to attack even if you don't initiate connections).
achines that run networked games should be protected from incoming
Internet connections.</p><p>





Running plug-ins and extensions to games may change their security
characteristics by adding new capabilities. If you have a game that
you trust, don't upgrade it or change it without re-evaluating
its security.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">23.2.1. Quake</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2173" />
<a name="INDEX-2174" />Quake, in its many and
varied versions, is one of the most popular Internet games. It also
has a long and sad history of security problems, particularly in its
Unix versions. You should not run any Quake binaries as root,
regardless of what the documentation says; Quake servers are
susceptible to remote attacks, and Quake clients running as root can
be exploited by local users.</p><p>





When Quake was originally written, the game developer, ID, put in a
special feature allowing the developer to run commands on all Quake
servers. These commands are not logged, and they don't have to
be normal Quake commands (Quake can run external programs). On all
platforms, you should be careful to run an up-to-date Quake server
and/or to refuse packets from ID's corporate network
(192.246.40.0/24) because the back door will allow attackers who
forge packets from that network to run arbitrary (and unlogged)
commands with the permissions of the Quake server.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">23.2.2. Summary of Recommendations for Games</h3>





<ul><li>Don't allow games through your firewall if you have a choice.
It may seem cruel to block harmless amusements, but they carry real
dangers.</p><p></li><li>If you want to run a game server, use a victim machine with nothing
else on it that you care about.</p><p></li><li>For popular games, you may be able to get dedicated proxies, some of
which offer security features. They are usually produced by third
parties and are rarely polished, commercial-level products.
They're not appropriate for highly secure environments or naive
users, but may be sufficient to support dedicated players in an
environment that doesn't require a great deal of security.</p><p></li><li>Install games with great care. It is almost never safe to run either
servers or clients as a privileged user.<a name="INDEX-2175" /></p><p></li></ul>
