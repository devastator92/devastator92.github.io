<h2 class="sect1">4.3. Protocols Above IP</h2>





<a name="INDEX-291" />IP serves as the base for
a number of different protocols; by far the most common are TCP, UDP,
and ICMP. In addition, we briefly discuss IP over IP (i.e., an IP
packet encapsulated within another IP packet), which is used
primarily for tunneling protocols over ordinary IP networks. This
technique has been used in the past to tunnel multicast IP packets
over nonmulticast IP networks, and more recently for a variety of
virtual private networking systems, IPv6, and some systems for
supporting mobile IP. These are the only IP-based protocols that
you're likely to see being routed between networks outside a
research environment.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-9" />[9]You may also see the routing
protocols OSPF or IGMP, which are discussed in <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>. However, they are rarely distributed between
networks and do not form the basis for other protocols.</p><p>




</blockquote>





<a name="ch04-4551" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.3.1. TCP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-292" /><a name="INDEX-293" /><a name="INDEX-294" />TCP is the protocol most commonly used for
services on the Internet. For example, Telnet, FTP, SMTP, NNTP, and
HTTP are all TCP-based services. TCP provides a reliable,
bidirectional connection between two endpoints. Opening a TCP
connection is like making a phone call: you dial the number, and
after a short setup period, a reliable connection is established
between you and whomever you're calling.</p><p>





TCP is <em class="emphasis">reliable</em> in that it makes three
guarantees to the application layer:</p><p>





<ul><li>The destination will receive the application data in the order it was
sent.</p><p></li><li>The destination will receive all the application data.</p></li><li>The destination will not receive duplicates of any of the application
data.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-295" />TCP will kill a connection rather than
violate one of these guarantees. For example, if TCP packets from the
middle of a session are lost in transit to the destination, the TCP
layer will arrange for those packets to be retransmitted before
handing the data up to the application layer. It won't hand up
the data following the missing data until it has the missing data. If
some of the data cannot be recovered, despite repeated attempts, the
TCP layer will kill the connection and report this to the application
layer, rather than hand up the data to the application layer with a
gap in it.</p><p>





These guarantees incur certain costs in both setup time (the two
sides of a connection have to exchange startup information before
they can actually begin moving data) and ongoing performance (the two
sides of a connection have to keep track of the status of the
connection, to determine what data needs to be resent to the other
side to fill in gaps in the conversation).</p><p>





TCP is <em class="emphasis">bidirectional</em> in that once a connection
is established, a server can reply to a client over the same
connection. You don't have to establish one connection from a
client to a server for queries or commands and another from the
server back to the client for answers.</p><p>





If you're trying to block a TCP connection, it is sufficient to
simply block the first packet of the connection. Without that first
packet (and, more importantly, the connection startup information it
contains), any further packets in that connection won't be
reassembled into a data stream by the receiver, and the connection
will never be made. That first packet is recognizable because
the<a name="INDEX-296" /> ACK bit in its
TCP header is not set; all other packets in the connection,
regardless of which direction they're going in, will have the
ACK bit set. (As we will discuss later, another bit, called the SYN
bit, also plays a part in connection negotiation; it must be on in
the first packet, but it can't be used to identify the first
packet because it is also on in the second packet.)</p><p>





Recognizing these "start-of-connection" TCP packets lets
you enforce a policy that allows internal clients to connect to
external servers but prevents external clients from connecting to
internal servers. You do this by allowing start-of-connection TCP
packets (those without the ACK bit set) only outbound and not
inbound. Start-of-connection packets would be allowed out from
internal clients to external servers but would not be allowed in from
external clients to internal servers. Attackers cannot subvert this
approach simply by turning on the ACK bit in their
start-of-connection packets, because the absence of the ACK bit is
what identifies these packets as start-of-connection packets.</p><p>





Packet filtering implementations vary in how they treat and let you
handle the ACK bit. Some packet filtering implementations give direct
access to the ACK bit  --  for example, by letting you include
"ack" as a keyword in a packet filtering rule. Some other
implementations give indirect access to the ACK bit. For example, the
Cisco "established" keyword works by examining this bit
(established is "true" if the ACK bit is set, and
"false" if the ACK bit is not set). Finally, some
implementations don't let you examine the ACK bit at all.</p><p>





<a name="ch04-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.3.1.1. TCP options</h3>





The ACK bit is only one of the options that can be set; the whole
list, in the order they appear in the header, is:</p><p>





<ul><li>URG (urgent)</p><p></li><li>ACK (acknowledgment)</p></li><li><p>PSH (push)</p></li><li><p>RST (reset)</p></li><li><p>SYN (synchronize)</p></li><li><p>FIN (finish)</p></li></ul>
URG and PSH are supposed to be used to identify particularly critical
data; PSH tells the receiver to stop buffering and let some program
have the data, while URG more generally marks data that the sender
thinks is particularly important (sometimes incorrectly called
"out of band" data). In practice, neither of these is
reliably implemented, and for most purposes, firewalls do not need to
take special action based on them. It can be useful for firewalls to
drop packets with URG or PSH set when dealing with protocols that are
known not to use these features.</p><p>





ACK and SYN together make up the famed TCP three-way handshake
(so-called because it takes three packets to set up a connection).
<a href="ch04_03.html#ch04-71732">Figure 4-5</a> shows what ACK and SYN are set to on
packets that are part of a TCP connection.</p><p>





<a name="ch04-71732" /><div class="figure"><img height="284" alt="Figure 4-5" src="figs/fire2.0405.gif" width="388" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-5. ACK bits on TCP packets</h4>

SYN is turned on for the first two packets of a connection (one in
each direction), in order to set up sequence numbers. The first
packet of a connection must have ACK off (since it isn't in
response to anything) but SYN on (to give the next packet a number to
acknowledge). Sequence numbers are discussed further in the section
that follows.</p><p>





RST and FIN are ways of closing a connection. RST is an ungraceful
close, sent to indicate that something has gone wrong (for instance,
there's no process listening on the port, or there seems to be
something nasty about the packet that came in). FIN is part of a
graceful shutdown, where both ends send FIN to each other to say
goodbye.</p><p>





Of this entire laundry list, ACK and RST are the only two of interest
to a firewall in normal operation (ACK because it is a reliable way
to identify the first packet of connections, and RST because
it's a useful way to shut people up without returning a helpful
error message). However, there are a number of attacks that involve
setting options that don't normally get set. Many TCP/IP
implementations respond badly to eccentric combinations of options
(for instance, they crash the machine). Others respond but
don't log the fact, allowing attackers to scan networks without
being noticed. These attacks are discussed further in the section
that follows.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch04-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.3.1.2. TCP sequence numbers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-297" />TCP provides a guarantee to
applications that they will always receive data in the correct order,
but nothing provides a guarantee to TCP that packets will always
arrive in the correct order. In order to get the packets back into
the correct order, TCP uses a number on each packet, called a
<em class="emphasis">sequence number</em>. At the beginning of a
connection, each end picks a number to start off with, and this
number is what's communicated when SYN is set. There are two
packets with SYN set (one in each direction), because the two ends
maintain separate sequence numbers, chosen independently. After the
SYN, for each packet, the number is simply incremented by the number
of data bytes in the packet. If the first sequence number is 200, and
the first data packet has 80 bytes of data on it, it will have a
sequence number of 280.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a> The ACK
is accompanied by the number of the next expected piece of data (the
sequence number plus one, or 281 in this case).</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-10" />[10]The details of how the
sequence number is calculated are actually slightly more complex than
this, but the end result is as described.</p><p>




</blockquote>





In order for an attacker to take over a TCP connection, the attacker
needs to get the sequence numbers correct. Since sequence numbers are
just incremented during a connection, this is easy for an attacker
who can see the traffic. On the other hand, it's much more
difficult if you can't see the initial negotiation; the initial
sequence number is supposed to be randomly chosen. However, on many
operating systems, initial sequence numbers are not actually random.
In some TCP/IP implementations, initial sequence numbers are
predictable; if you know what initial sequence number one connection
uses, you can figure out what initial sequence number the next one
will use, because the numbers are simply incremented, either based on
number of connections (the number gets bigger by some fixed amount on
each connection) or based on time (the number gets bigger by some
fixed amount each microsecond).</p><p>





This may seem like it's not worth worrying about. After all, in
order to hijack a connection by predicting sequence numbers, an
attacker needs:</p><p>





<ol><li>The ability to forge TCP/IP packets.</p><p></li><li>The initial sequence number for one connection.</p></li><li><p>The knowledge that somebody else has started up a desirable
connection (but not the ability to actually see that
connection -- if the attacker can see the connection,
there's no need to predict the sequence number).</p><p></li><li>Precise information about when the desirable connection started up.</p></li><li>Either the ability to redirect traffic so that you receive responses,
or the ability to continue the conversation and achieve something
without ever getting any of the responses.</p><p></li></ol>
In fact, for years this was considered a purely hypothetical attack,
something that paranoid minds came up with but that presented no
danger in reality. However, it was eventually implemented, and
programs are now available that simplify the process. It's
still not a technique that's used routinely by casual
attackers, but it's available to determined attackers, even if
they aren't technically extremely advanced. You should be sure
that security-critical hosts have truly random initial sequence
numbers by installing an appropriate version of the operating
system.<a name="INDEX-298" />

<a name="ch04-4626" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.3.2. UDP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-302" /><a name="INDEX-303" /><a name="INDEX-304" />The
body of an IP packet might contain a UDP packet instead of a TCP
packet. UDP is a low-overhead alternative to TCP.</p><p>





UDP is <em class="emphasis">low overhead</em> in that it doesn't
make any of the reliability guarantees (delivery, ordering, and
nonduplication) that TCP does, and, therefore, it doesn't need
the mechanism to make those guarantees. Every UDP packet is
independent; UDP packets aren't part of a "virtual
circuit" as TCP packets are. Sending UDP packets is like
dropping postcards in the mail: if you drop 100 postcards in the
mail, even if they're all addressed to the same place, you
can't be absolutely sure that they're all going to get
there, and those that do get there probably won't be in exactly
the same order they were in when you sent them. (As it turns out, UDP
packets are far less likely to arrive than postcards -- but they
are far more likely to arrive in the same order.)</p><p>





Unlike postcards, UDP packets can actually arrive intact more than
once. Multiple copies are possible because the packet might be
duplicated by the underlying network. For example, on an Ethernet, a
packet would be duplicated if a router thought that it might have
been the victim of an Ethernet collision. If the router was wrong,
and the original packet had not been the victim of a collision, both
the original and the duplicate would eventually arrive at the
destination. (An application may also decide to send the same data
twice, perhaps because it didn't get an expected response to
the first one, or maybe just because it's confused.)</p><p>





All of these things can happen to TCP packets, too, but they will be
corrected before the data is passed to the application. With UDP, the
application is responsible for dealing with the data exactly as it
arrives in packets, not corrected by the underlying protocol.</p><p>





UDP packets are very similar to TCP packets in structure. A UDP
header contains UDP source and destination port numbers, just like
the TCP source and destination port numbers. However, a UDP header
does not contain any of the flags or sequence numbers that TCP uses.
In particular, it doesn't contain anything resembling an ACK
bit. The ACK bit is part of TCP's mechanism for guaranteeing
reliable delivery of data. Because UDP makes no such guarantees, it
has no need for an ACK bit. There is no way for a packet filtering
router to determine, simply by examining the header of an incoming
UDP packet, whether that packet is a first packet from an external
client to an internal server, or a response from an external server
back to an internal client.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch04-4684" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.3.3. ICMP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-305" /><a name="INDEX-306" /><a name="INDEX-307" /><a name="INDEX-308" />ICMP
is used for IP status and control messages. ICMP packets are carried
in the body of IP packets, just as TCP and UDP packets are. Examples
of ICMP messages include:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Echo request</em></i></dt>
<dd>What a host sends when you run <em class="emphasis">ping</em>.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Echo response</em></i></dt>
<dd>What a host responds to an "echo request" with.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Time exceeded</em></i></dt>
<dd>What a router returns when it determines that a packet appears to be
looping. A more intuitive name might be <em class="emphasis">maximum hopcount
exceeded</em> because it's based on the number of routers
a packet has passed through, not a period of time.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Destination unreachable</em></i></dt>
<dd>What a router returns when the destination of a packet can't be
reached for some reason (e.g., because a network link is down).</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Redirect</em></i></dt>
<dd>What a router sends a host in response to a packet the host should
have sent to a different router. The router handles the original
packet anyway (forwarding it to the router it should have gone to in
the first place), and the redirect tells the host about the more
efficient path for next time.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Unlike TCP or UDP, ICMP has no source or destination ports, and no
other protocols layered on top of it. Instead, there is a set of
defined ICMP message types; the particular type used dictates the
interpretation of the rest of the ICMP packet. Some types also have
individual codes that convey extra information (for instance, the
"Destination unreachable" type has codes for different
conditions that caused the destination to be unreachable, one of
which is the "Fragmentation needed and Don't Fragment
set" code used for path MTU discovery).</p><p>





any packet filtering systems let you filter ICMP packets based on
the ICMP message type field, much as they allow you to filter TCP or
UDP packets based on the TCP or UDP source and destination port
fields. Relatively few of them allow you to filter on codes within a
type. This is a problem because you will probably want to allow
"Fragmentation needed and Don't Fragment set" (for
path MTU discovery) but not any of the other codes under
"Destination unreachable", all of which can be used to
scan networks to see what hosts are attackable.</p><p>





ost ICMP packets have little or no meaningful information in the
body of the packet, and therefore should be quite small. However,
various people have discovered denial of service attacks using
oversized ICMP packets (particularly echo packets, otherwise known as
"ping" packets after the Unix command normally used to
send them). It is a good idea to put a size limit on any ICMP packet
types you allow through your filters.</p><p>





There have also been attacks that use ICMP as a <em class="emphasis">covert
channel,</em> a way of smuggling information. As we mentioned
previously, most ICMP packet bodies contain little or no meaningful
information. However, they may contain padding, the content of which
is undefined. For instance, if you use ICMP echo for timing or
testing reasons, you will want to be able to vary the length of the
packets and possibly the patterns of the data in them (some
transmission mechanisms are quite sensitive to bit patterns, and
speeds may vary depending on how compressible the data is, for
instance). You are therefore allowed to put arbitrary data into the
body of ICMP echo packets, and that data is normally ignored;
it's not filtered, logged, or examined by anybody. For someone
who wants to smuggle data through a firewall that allows ICMP echo,
these bodies are a very tempting place to put it. They may even be
able to smuggle data into a site that allows only outbound echo
requests by sending echo responses even when they haven't seen
a request. This will be useful only if the machine that the responses
are being sent to is configured to receive them; it won't help
anyone break into a site, but it's a way for people to maintain
connections to compromised sites.</p><p>

<a name="ch04-4881" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.3.4. IP over IP and GRE</h3>





<a name="INDEX-309" /><a name="INDEX-310" /><a name="INDEX-311" /><a name="INDEX-312" />In some circumstances, IP packets are
encapsulated within other IP packets for transmission, yielding
so-called <em class="emphasis">IP over IP.</em> IP over IP is used for
various purposes, including:</p><p>





<ul><li>Encapsulating encrypted network traffic; for instance, using the
IPsec standard or PPTP, which are described in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p></li><li>Carrying multicast IP packets (that is, packets with multicast
destination addresses) between networks that do support
multicasting<a name="INDEX-313" /><a name="INDEX-314" />
over intermediate networks that don't</p><p></li><li>Mobile IP (allowing a machine to move between networks while keeping
a fixed IP address)</p><p></li><li>Carrying IPv6 traffic over IPv4 networks</p></li></ul>
ultiple different protocols are used for IP over IP, including
protocols named Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), IP in IP, IP
within IP, and swIPe. Currently, GRE appears to be the most popular.
The general principle is the same in all cases; a machine somewhere
picks up a packet, encapsulates it into a new IP packet, and sends it
on to a machine that will unwrap it and process it appropriately.</p><p>





In some cases (for instance, for multicast and IPv6 traffic), the
encapsulation and de-encapsulation is done by special routers. The
sending and receiving machines send out their multicast or IPv6
traffic without knowing anything about the network in between, and
when they get to a point where the network will not handle the
special type, a router does the encapsulation. In this case, the
encapsulated packet will be addressed to another router, which will
unwrap it. The encapsulation may also be done by the sending machine
or the de-encapsulation by the receiving machine.</p><p>





IP over IP is also a common technique used for creating virtual
private networks, which are discussed further in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Firewall Technologies"</a>. It is the basis for a number of higher-level
protocols, including IPsec and PPTP, which are discussed further in
<a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





IP over IP presents a problem for firewalls because the firewall sees
the IP header information of the external packet, not the original
information. In some cases, it is possible but difficult for the
firewall to read the original headers; in other cases, the original
packet information is encrypted, preventing it from being read by
snoopers, but also by the firewall. This means that the firewall
cannot make decisions about the internal packet, and there is a risk
that it will pass traffic that should be denied. IP over IP should be
permitted only when the destination of the external packet is a
trusted host that will drop the de-encapsulated packet if it is not
expected and permitted.<a name="INDEX-315" /></p><p>
