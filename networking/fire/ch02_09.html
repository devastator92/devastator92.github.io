<h2 class="sect1">2.9. Administrative Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-206" /><a name="INDEX-207" />A variety of services are used to manage
and maintain networks; these are services that most users don't
use directly  --  indeed, that many of them have never even heard
of  --  but they are very important tools for network managers.
They are described in detail in <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch02-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.9.1. System Management</h3>





<a name="INDEX-208" /><a name="INDEX-209" />Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol designed to make it
easy to centrally manage network devices. Originally, SNMP focused on
devices that were purely network-oriented (routers, bridges,
concentrators, and hubs, for instance). These days, SNMP agents may
be found on almost anything that connects to a network, whether or
not it's part of the network infrastructure. Many hosts have
SNMP agents; large software packages, like databases, often have
specialized SNMP agents; and even telephone switches and power
systems have network interfaces with SNMP agents.</p><p>





SNMP management stations can request information from agents via
SNMP. SNMP management stations can also control certain functions of
the device. Devices can also report urgent information (for example,
that a line has gone down, or that a significant number of errors are
occurring on a given line) to management stations via SNMP. Devices
vary greatly in the sorts of information they give out via SNMP, and
in the parameters that can be changed via SNMP. The network devices
that originally spoke SNMP used it for mildly sensitive data, like
the number of bytes that had gone through a specific port, or the
routing table of a given device. Some of them allowed management
stations to do potentially catastrophic things (turning off a network
interface, for instance), but most of them didn't (if only
because many of them simply failed to implement the "set"
command, which is required for a management station to actually
change anything).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-210" />Modern SNMP agents often contain
extremely sensitive data; the default SNMP agent for Windows NT
includes the complete list of valid usernames on the machine and a
list of currently running services, for instance. Many SNMP agents
allow for machine reboots and other critical changes. Unfortunately,
they are hardly secured at all. SNMP security currently relies on a
cleartext password, known as a <em class="emphasis">community string</em>,
with a well-known and widely used default. Some SNMP agents implement
additional levels of security (for instance, controls over the IP
addresses they will accept queries from), but these are still
insufficient for extremely sensitive data. Allowing SNMP from the
Internet is extremely dangerous.</p><p>





With the introduction of SNMP v3, which provides better
authentication and can encrypt data, it is becoming possible to run
SNMP more securely. However, SNMP v3 is not yet widespread.<a name="INDEX-211" /></p><p>

<a name="ch02-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.9.2. Routing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-212" />Routing
protocols like RIP and OSPF are used to distribute information about
where packets should be directed. Transactions on the Internet
involve hosts distributed across the world, which are added, moved,
and deleted, all without a single central authority to control them.
The Domain Name System provides part of the information necessary to
make this work (the mapping between human-readable names and
machine-usable numbers), and another critical part is provided by
routing services, which distribute information about which numbers
are where and how to get to them.</p><p>





If you interfere with a host's routing, you interfere with its
ability to talk to the rest of the world. You can cut it off
altogether or merely steal traffic that was intended to go someplace
else. Unfortunately, most routing protocols now in use were designed
when the Internet was a less dangerous place, and they don't
provide any significant degree of protection.</p><p>





The good news is that routing information rarely needs to go to any
significant number of hosts; in general, you will have at most a few
routers that talk to the Internet, and those will be the only hosts
that need to talk routing protocols to the Internet. In general, you
will not need to pass routing protocols through firewalls, unless you
are using internal firewalls inside a site.</p><p>

<a name="ch02-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.9.3. Network Diagnostics</h3>





<a name="INDEX-213" /><a name="INDEX-214" />The two most common network management tools
are <em class="emphasis">ping</em> and <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>
(also known as <em class="emphasis">tracert</em>). Both are named after
the Unix programs that were the first implementations, but both are
now available in some form on almost all Internet-capable platforms.
They do not have their own protocols but make use of the same
underlying protocol, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
Unlike most of the programs we've discussed, they are not
clients of distinguishable servers. ICMP is implemented at a low
level as a required part of the TCP/IP protocols all Internet hosts
use. <a name="INDEX-215" /><a name="INDEX-216" /></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-217" /><em class="emphasis">ping</em> simply tests
reachability; it tells you whether or not you can get a packet to and
from a given host, and often additional information like how long it
took the packet to make the round trip.
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> tells you not only whether you can
reach a given host (and whether it can answer), but also the route
your packets take to get to that host; this is very useful in
analyzing and debugging network trouble somewhere between you and
some destination.</p><p>





Because there aren't servers for <em class="emphasis">ping</em> and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>, you can't simply decide not to
turn the servers on. However, you can use packet filtering to prevent
them from reaching your machines. There are few risks for outbound
<em class="emphasis">ping</em> or <em class="emphasis">traceroute,</em> and
those risks can be avoided by using them without hostname resolution.
Inbound <em class="emphasis">ping</em> and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>, however, pose significant risks.
<em class="emphasis">ping</em>, in particular, is a frequent basis for
denial of service attacks. <em class="emphasis">ping</em> and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em> can both be used to determine which
hosts at your site exist, as a preliminary step to attacking them.
For this reason, many sites either prevent or limit the relevant
packets inbound.</p><p>

<a name="ch02-1245" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.9.4. Time Service </h3>





<a name="INDEX-218" /><a name="INDEX-219" /><a name="INDEX-220" />Network
Time Protocol (NTP), an Internet service that sets the clocks on your
system with great precision, has clients on most operating systems
(including Unix, Windows NT, and MacOS). Synchronizing time among
different machines is important in many ways. From a security point
of view, examining the precise times noted on the log files of
different machines may help in analyzing patterns of break-ins.
Having synchronized clocks is also a requirement for preventing
attackers from recording an interaction and then repeating it (a
playback attack); if timestamps are encoded in the interaction, they
will be incorrect the second time the transaction is replayed.
Kerberos authentication, for example, which we discuss in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, depends on time synchronization. From a
practical point of view, synchronized clocks are also required to
successfully use NFS.</p><p>





You do not have to use NTP across the Internet; it will synchronize
clocks to each other within your site, if that's all you want.
The reason that people use NTP from the Internet is that a number of
hosts with extremely accurate clocks  --  radio clocks that
receive the time signal from master atomic clocks or from the atomic
clocks in the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites  -- 
provide NTP service to make certain that your clocks are not only
synchronous with each other but also correct. Without an external
time service, you might find that all your computers have exactly the
same wrong time. Accepting an external service makes you vulnerable
to spoofing, but because NTP won't move the clocks very far
very fast, a spoofed external clock is unlikely to make you
vulnerable to a playback attack, although it could succeed in
annoying you by running all your clocks slow or fast. Radio or GPS
clocks suitable for use as NTP time sources are not terribly
expensive, however, and if you are using NTP to synchronize clocks
for an authentication protocol like Kerberos, you should buy your own
and provide all time service internally, instead of using an external
reference.</p><p>
