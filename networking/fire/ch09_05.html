<h2 class="sect1">9.5. Using SOCKS for Proxying</h2>





<a name="INDEX-691" /> <a name="INDEX-692" />The SOCKS package, originally written by
David Koblas and Michelle Koblas, and subsequently maintained by
Ying-Da Lee, is an example of the type of proxy system that can
support both proxy-aware applications and proxy-aware clients. A
reference implementation of SOCKS is freely available, and it has
become the de facto standard proxying package on the Internet. It is
also a proposed official Internet standard, documented in RFC 1928.
<a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>, tells you how to get the freely
available version of SOCKS; multiple commercial versions are also
available.</p><p>





<a name="ch09-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.1. Versions of SOCKS</h3>





<a name="INDEX-693" />Two
versions of the SOCKS protocol are currently in use, SOCKS4 and
SOCKS5. The two protocols are not compatible, but most SOCKS5 servers
will detect attempts to use SOCKS4 and handle them appropriately. The
main additions in SOCKS5 are:</p><p>





<ul><li>User authentication</p><p></li><li>UDP and ICMP</p></li><li><p>Hostname resolution at the SOCKS server</p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-694" />SOCKS4 does no real user authentication.
It bases its decisions on whether to allow or deny connections on the
same sort of information that packet filters use (source and
destination ports and IP addresses). SOCKS5 provides support for
several different ways of authenticating users, which gives you more
precise control and logging.</p><p>





SOCKS4 works only for TCP-based clients; it doesn't work for
UDP-based clients or ICMP functions like <em class="emphasis">ping</em>
and <em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>. If you are using a UDP-based
client, you will need to get another package. You can either use
SOCKS5 or the UDP Packet Relayer. This program serves much the same
function for UDP-based clients as SOCKS serves for TCP-based clients.
Like SOCKS, the UDP Packet Relayer is freely available on the
Internet. SOCKS5 is the only widely used freely available proxy for
ICMP.</p><p>





SOCKS4 requires the client to be able to map hostnames to IP
addresses. With SOCKS5, the client can provide the hostname instead
of the IP address, and the socks server will do the hostname
resolution. This is convenient for sites that do what is called
"fake root" DNS, where internal hosts use a purely
internal name server that does not communicate with the Internet.
(This configuration is discussed further in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>.)</p><p>

<a name="ch09-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.2. SOCKS Features</h3>





In order to make it easy to support new clients, SOCKS is extremely
generic. This limits the features that it can provide. SOCKS
doesn't do any protocol-specific control or logging.</p><p>





SOCKS does log connection requests on the server; provide access
control by user, by source host and port number, or by destination
host and port number; and allow configurable responses to access
denials. For example, it can be configured to notify an administrator
of incoming access attempts and to let users know why their outgoing
access attempts were denied.</p><p>





The prime advantage of SOCKS is its popularity. Because SOCKS is
widely used, server implementations and SOCKS-ified clients (i.e.,
versions of programs like FTP and Telnet that have already been
converted to use SOCKS) are commonly available, and help is easy to
find. This can be a double-edged sword; cases have been reported
where intruders to firewalled sites have installed their own
SOCKS-knowledgeable clients.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch09-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.3. SOCKS Components</h3>





The SOCKS package includes the following components:</p><p>





<ul><li>The SOCKS server. This server must run on a Unix system, although it
has been ported to many different variants of Unix.</p><p></li><li>The SOCKS client library for Unix machines.</p></li><li>SOCKS-ified versions of several standard Unix client programs such as
FTP and Telnet.</p><p></li><li>SOCKS wrappers for <em class="emphasis">ping</em> and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</em>.</p><p></li><li>The <em class="emphasis">runsocks</em> program to SOCKS-ify dynamically
linked programs at runtime without recompiling.</p><p></li></ul>
In addition, client libraries for Macintosh and Windows systems are
available as separate packages.</p><p>





<a href="ch09_05.html#ch09-62904">Figure 9-4</a> shows the use of SOCKS for proxying.</p><p>

<a name="ch09-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.4. Converting Clients to Use SOCKS</h3>





any Internet client programs (both commercial and freely available)
already have SOCKS support built in to them as a compile-time or a
runtime option.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-695" />How do you convert a client
program to use SOCKS? You need to modify the program so it talks to
the SOCKS server, rather than trying to talk to the real world
directly. You do this by recompiling the program with the SOCKS
library.</p><p>





Converting a client program to use SOCKS is usually pretty easy. The
SOCKS package makes certain assumptions about how client programs
work, and most client programs already follow these assumptions. For
a complete summary of these assumptions, see the file in the SOCKS
release called <em class="emphasis">What_SOCKS_expects</em>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-696" /><a name="INDEX-697" /><a name="INDEX-698" />To convert a client program,
you must replace all calls to standard network functions with calls
to the SOCKS versions of those functions. Here are the calls.</p><p>





<a name="ch09-9-fm2xml" /><table border="1">



<tr>
<th>
Standard Network Function</p><p></th>
<th>
SOCKS Version</p><p></th>
</tr>










<tr>
<td>
<tt class="literal">connect( )</tt></p><p></td>
<td>
<tt class="literal">Rconnect( )</tt></p><p></td>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<tt class="literal">getsockname( )</tt></p><p></td>
<td>
<tt class="literal">Rgetsockname( )</tt></p><p></td>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<tt class="literal">bind( )</tt></p><p></td>
<td>
<tt class="literal">Rbind( )</tt></p><p></td>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<tt class="literal">accept( )</tt></p><p></td>
<td>
<tt class="literal">Raccept( )</tt></p><p></td>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<tt class="literal">listen( )</tt></p><p></td>
<td>
<tt class="literal">Rlisten( )</tt></p><p></td>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<tt class="literal">select( )</tt></p><p></td>
<td>
<tt class="literal">Rselect( )</tt></p><p></td>
</tr>





</table><p>

You can usually do this simply by including the file
<em class="emphasis">socks.h</em>, included in the SOCKS distribution. If
not, you can use the older method of adding the following to the
<tt class="literal">CFLAGS=</tt> line of the program's Makefile:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">-Dconnect=Rconnect  
     -Dgetsockname=Rgetsockname  
     -Dbind=Rbind  
     -Daccept=Raccept  
     -Dlisten=Rlisten  
     -Dselect=Rselect</pre></blockquote>





Then, recompile and link the program with the SOCKS client library.</p><p>





The client machine needs to have not only the SOCKS-modified clients,
but also something to tell it what SOCKS server to contact for what
services (on Unix machines, the <em class="emphasis">/etc/socks.conf</em>
file). In addition, if you want to control access with Auth, the
client machines must be running an Auth server (for instance,
<em class="emphasis">identd</em>, which will allow the SOCKS server to
identify what user is controlling the port that the connection comes
from. Because there's no way for the SOCKS server to verify
that the Auth server is reliable, Auth can't be trusted if
anybody might intentionally be circumventing it; we recommend using
SOCKS5 with user authentication instead. See <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, for more information about Auth.<a name="INDEX-699" /> <a name="INDEX-700" /></p><p>
