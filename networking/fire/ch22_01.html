<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> and the Simple Network Management

These protocols are used to manage devices on the network, either by
simply conveying information about their status or by actually
controlling remote devices.</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-2030" /></a><a name="INDEX-2031" /></a><em class="emphasis">syslog</em>
is used to manage log messages in a centralized way.
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> got its start as a way of centrally
recording messages for a set of Unix machines, but many network
devices (routers, hubs, etc.) now use <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> to
report status and usage information. Such devices often don't
even have a way to record this information locally, because they
don't have any writable storage media; if you want to know what
they're reporting, something has to be listening to their
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> messages.</p><p>





icrosoft operating systems do not provide
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> support; instead, they use a combination
of a local log manager and SNMP for remote event reporting. It is
possible to get implementations of <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> for
such systems.</p><p>





Attackers will often attempt to flood a site's
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> server in order to cover their tracks, so
that the server runs out of disk space and stops logging new
messages, or so that the evidence of their activities is lost in the
noise. Recent versions of <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> often have the
ability to turn off listening from the network, while still keeping
the ability to send messages to remote servers; some of them also
provide the ability to accept remote messages only from specific
source addresses.</p><p>

<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> is a UDP-based service.
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> servers (which record messages logged by
other systems) listen on UDP port 514. <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>
clients generally (but not always) use ports above 1023 to talk to
servers. <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> servers never send messages back
to clients. <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> servers can be configured to
pass messages along to other <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> servers; in
such cases, the sending server generally uses port 514 as the client
port. There are TCP-based variants of <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>
available, but there is no standard yet.</p><p>

<a name="ch22-14662" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">22.1.2. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2033" /></a>SNMP is a
standardized remote monitoring and management mechanism for network
devices like hubs, routers, and bridges, as well as servers and
workstations. The theory is that any SNMP-capable management station
should be able to monitor and control any SNMP-capable network
device.</p><p>





Normally, SNMP management stations act as clients, contacting SNMP
servers in the various network devices to request information or to
issue commands. Sometimes, network devices act as SNMP clients to
contact special SNMP servers (known as <em class="emphasis">trap</em>
servers) on management stations to report critical information that
can't wait until the next time the management station polls the
device. SNMP trap servers are separate from regular SNMP servers so
that a given machine can run both  --  that is, can be both an
SNMP server (and thus be manageable via SNMP) and an SNMP trap server
(and thus be a management station and receive traps from other
devices).</p><p>





In general, you don't want someone from the outside to be able
to manage your network via SNMP. Therefore, you shouldn't allow
SNMP to cross your firewall, and you should carefully configure (or
disable) SNMP on your systems that are outside your firewall so that
attackers can't use it to change that configuration. See <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Unix and Linux Bastion Hosts"</a>, and <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Windows NT and Windows 2000 Bastion Hosts "</a>, for more information on how to properly
configure bastion hosts.</p><p>





The <a name="INDEX-2034" /></a>SNMP version in widest use, which is
SNMPv2, does support some rudimentary security; when information is
requested, the requester needs to specify a
<em class="emphasis">community</em> that it's in. Different
communities can be shown different information, and in some
implementations, a reusable password can be required for certain
communities. At its best, this security is quite primitive; anybody
who's doing packet sniffing can easily discover a community
name and password. Since relatively few implementations support
passwords, and almost all implementations provide a default community
called "public", it's very rare to find things at
their best. At least one implementation not only comes with the
"public" community but does not provide any permanent way
to disable access for this community!</p><p>





SNMP can be an extraordinarily dangerous protocol. The minimal
information most devices will give out includes operating system
details and precise traffic loads and destinations, which is already
information you don't want attackers to have. Many
implementations add even more critical information (for instance,
icrosoft's SNMP server will list all valid account names on
the machine and most of the services running on it). In addition, it
is possible for a remote machine not only to request information but
to set variables. Since SNMP is intended for network management, and
an SNMP client is expected to be a network management console, these
variables usually give you full control of at least the
machine's network configuration, and often more than that. For
instance, you can often reboot a remote machine via SNMP, and
icrosoft systematically attempts to make all the functionality of
service control panels available over SNMP. Routers can often be
completely controlled via SNMP.</p><p>





In general, the default "public" community is able only
to read information, but it is often able to read all the available
information, which in several implementations from large router
vendors includes a listing of all the communities and their
capabilities, so that anybody can read the information about how to
get write access.</p><p>





On machines that are running multiple SNMP-enabled services (for
instance, machines that have an operating system SNMP agent and are
also running Oracle), SNMP servers may be at unexpected ports. If
multiple SNMP agents need to run on the same machine, only one of
them can be at SNMP's normal port. One way to deal with it is
to have a master agent at that port and move some or all of the other
SNMP agents to other ports (normally above 1024, since that's
where free ports are likely to be). The master agent then speaks SNMP
to the other agents (commonly referred to as
<em class="emphasis">sub-agents</em>), which don't have to be aware
that there's anything unusual happening. This is a very
flexible approach, but it is yet another service that may be
vulnerable if you open up connections above 1024.</p><p>





<a name="ch22-5-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.1.2.1. SNMP version 3</h3>





Implementations of SNMPv3 are just becoming available. SNMPv3
provides greatly enhanced security, including user authentication,
encrypted communications, and time-stamped digital signatures that
prevent attackers from intercepting and resending packets. Gateways
that translate between SNMPv3 and earlier versions of SNMP are
available, allowing you to use SNMPv3 across insecure links to manage
older devices as long as there is some secure link between the
gateway and the managed device.</p><p>

<a name="ch22-14718" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.1.2.2. Packet filtering characteristics of SNMP</h3>





SNMP is a UDP-based service. SNMP servers (in network devices) listen
on UDP port 161. (TCP port 161 is also reserved for use by SNMP but
has been used only experimentally.) SNMP trap servers (in management
stations) listen on UDP port 162. SNMP clients generally use ports
above 1023 to talk to both regular and trap servers. By convention,
SNMP sub-agents are at port 1161, but they might be anywhere.</p><p>

All versions of SNMP use the same port numbers, so you will not be
able to tell what version you are allowing through your packet
filters. Since different versions have very different levels of
security, you will probably want to limit access to those devices
that you know are appropriately secure.</p><p>

<a name="ch22-15086" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.1.2.3. Proxying characteristics of SNMP</h3>





SNMP is not commonly used across the Internet (although Internet
service providers frequently use it), and proxies are not widely
available. You may be able to modify network management stations to
use proxies for SNMP gets, but in many cases, you will not be able to
do traps through proxies. This is because the SNMP agent has to
generate the trap, and it is often running on a device where neither
the software nor the procedures are particularly modifiable.</p><p>

<a name="ch22-7-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.1.2.4. Network address translation and SNMP</h3>





SNMP does not use embedded IP addresses directly, and SNMP itself
will function without problems through network address translation
systems. However, the information that's distributed through
SNMP will almost always include IP addresses that will not be
translated. This may leak information that's considered
confidential and will certainly cause problems if any person or
program tries to use the information. A number of network management
programs will use the address information inside the SNMP data to
make subsequent connections to managed machines, which will not
work.<a name="INDEX-2035" /></a></p><p>

<a name="ch22-8-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">22.1.3. System Management Server (SMS)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2036" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2037" /></a>Microsoft's System
anagement Server is a suite of programs used to manage Windows
computers. It is not a single service, and the exact services that
are included change with different releases of SMS. The basic
functions of SMS are:<a name="INDEX-2038" /></a></p><p>





<ul><li>Hardware and software inventory</p><p></li><li>Software distribution<p></p></li><li><p>Shared application management</p></li><li><p>Remote control</p></li></ul>
In addition, SMS normally includes a variety of utilities intended to
help system administrators, including:</p><p>





<ul><li>An enhanced network monitor</p><p></li><li>SNMP tools to convert events to traps and receive traps<p></p></li><li><p>Database tools to clean databases and produce reports</p></li></ul>
SMS also depends on having a SQL server available to store data in
and uses directory replication to distribute some of its information.
ost of these services, including directory replication and the
default configuration for the SQL server, are based on SMB
transactions, which are discussed in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





SMS has very serious security implications. The SMS hardware and
software inventory provide detailed information about machines, and
the software distribution mechanism allows any command to be executed
with full Administrator permissions. All client machines are
completely at the mercy of the SMS servers. In addition, an SMS
system normally involves multiple server machines (for instance, one
running the database server, one running software distribution, and
one storing the shared applications), and those servers all trust
each other. If any of the machines involved is compromised, the
attacker will have control of all of the servers and, through them,
of all of the clients.</p><p>





Several of the utilities included in SMS are useful in a firewall
environment; the network monitor, for instance, is an important
diagnostic tool, and there is a tool for turning events into SNMP
traps. The primary functions of SMS (hardware and software inventory,
software distribution, and shared application management) are all
risky and should not be run through a firewall or to firewall
machines.<a name="INDEX-2039" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2040" /></a></p><p>

<a name="ch22-9-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">22.1.4. Performance Monitor and Network Monitor</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2041" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2042" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2043" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2044" /></a>Under
Windows NT, the two most frequently used tools for diagnosing system
problems and tracking usage are Performance Monitor and Network
onitor. Both of these programs allow you to access remote machines
and get data from them. They are based on SMB transactions, which are
discussed further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





Performance Monitor and Network Monitor both provide information
that's useful to attackers. Performance Monitor is the less
interesting of the two; it provides performance and utilization data
that will tell an attacker some useful data about the machine
configuration, the amount of work needed to produce a denial of
service, and the likelihood that anybody will notice if the attacker
starts using the machine, but it doesn't give out anything of
immediate use in breaking into the machine.</p><p>





Network Monitor, on the other hand, comes with an agent that will let
an attacker use the machine as a remote network sniffer. The version
of Network Monitor that comes with Windows NT shows only packets sent
to and from the machine it's running on (including broadcast
and multicast packets), but that's plenty of data for an
attacker to do damage with. If you have installed the full-featured
version that comes with System Management Server, it will show all
traffic that comes to the port, regardless of the machine that the
traffic was sent to. Depending on your network configuration, this
may make no difference (for instance, on a switched network, hosts
will normally receive only their own traffic), or it may be all the
traffic on the network segment (for instance, if you're using
simple hubs or classic Ethernet bus-style cabling).</p><p>





Because they are based on SMB transactions, Network Monitor and
Performance Monitor are difficult to secure through a firewall, and
you should not allow them. Because the Network Monitor Agent and
Performance Monitor are extremely useful management tools, you may
want to allow them on machines that make up your firewall. In this
situation, you should be sure that they are not running on interfaces
that can be reached from the Internet. It would be better yet to run
Network Monitor and Performance Monitor locally on the firewall
machine and disable SMB over the network altogether.</p><p>
