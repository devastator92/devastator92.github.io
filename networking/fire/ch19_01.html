mail, and newsgroups allow people to send each other messages that
will be read at later times, but what if you want to send an
immediate message or have a discussion instead? Several services
available on the Internet allow people to interact in real time on
the Internet, ranging from "chat rooms" where people can
send text messages to teleconferencing programs with video, audio,
and whiteboard facilities.</p><p>

<h2 class="sect1">19.1. Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1804" /></a><a name="INDEX-1805" /></a>IRC is a multi-user
text-based real-time conferencing system. Users run IRC client
programs to connect to IRC servers. IRC servers can be arranged in a
spanning tree and talk to each other to pass messages to all of the
clients; these days, many IRC servers are independent and don't
take part in a tree. <a href="ch19_01.html#ch19-47746">Figure 19-1</a> shows how the IRC
servers are connected. Clients might connect to any of these
servers.<a name="INDEX-1806" /></a></p><p>





<a name="ch19-47746" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="278" alt="Figure 19-1" src="figs/fire2.1901.gif" width="473" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 19-1. IRC server tree</h4>

ost of the security problems with IRC are related to who uses it and
how, not to the protocol per se. As we mentioned in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Internet Services"</a>, many clients allow servers far more access to
local resources (files, processes, programs, etc.) than they should,
and a malicious server can wreak havoc with a weak or poorly
configured client. Further, some of the frequent users of IRC have a
nasty habit of persuading new users to naively run commands that
those users think will do neat things on their systems but instead
trash these systems.</p><p>





any well-intentioned IRC users are simply naive about security. For
example, they think it's really neat to distribute software by
putting up a little server on their machine and advising people to
"<em class="emphasis">telnet</em> myhost myport | sh" to have
the software installed for them, which allows external users to
install the software without interaction from the user but would also
let them run any command whatsoever on the internal user's host
as that user. It's close to impossible to distinguish hostile
people from naive ones, and users should be advised to never issue
any command, in or out of their IRC client, just because somebody
advised them to over IRC.</p><p>





Although these problems are widespread on IRC, IRC is also a useful
and popular way for people to talk to each other. Text-based,
multi-user, real-time communication can be handy; it has many of the
advantages of teleconferencing for a much lower price tag.</p><p>





While IRC clients pose a risk, IRC servers are relatively safe. You
should be able to safely run an IRC server in a restricted
(<em class="emphasis">chroot</em>ed) environment on a bastion host, but it
would be somewhat bizarre to run a server without having any local
clients that could access it, and a server that could access the
Internet would probably not be safe for clients to talk to. You may
want to run one inside your firewall for private IRC conferencing.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1807" /></a><a name="INDEX-1808" /></a>Many IRC clients support
something called Direct Client Connections (DCC). DCC allows two IRC
clients to negotiate and establish a direct TCP connection between
themselves, bypassing all the servers except for the initial
negotiation. Most IRC servers will attempt to use the Auth protocol
to get information about the user. Some IRC servers will not accept
connections if Auth doesn't work. See <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, for more information about Auth.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">19.1.1. Packet Filtering Characteristics of IRC</h3>





IRC is a TCP-based service. Servers generally listen for incoming
connections (from both clients and other servers) on port 6667,
although some servers use other port numbers. Clients (and servers
contacting other servers) use ports above 1023.</p><p>





Clients use ports above 1023 to talk to other clients using DCC. To
start, the calling client passes an invitation to the called client
through the normal IRC server channels. The invitation includes a TCP
port number where the calling client is listening for an incoming
connection. The called client, if it chooses to accept the
invitation, opens a TCP connection to that port.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">19.1.2. Proxying Characteristics of IRC</h3>





When all IRC servers were part of the same spanning tree, any IRC
server could serve as a proxy server. These days, IRC servers tend to
be independent, and users are likely to want to contact many
different servers. It's therefore necessary to have true
proxies. A SOCKS-aware IRC client, <em class="emphasis">mIRC</em>, is
available for most Unix variants; so is a security-aware dedicated
IRC proxy called <em class="emphasis">tircproxy</em>.</p><p>





DCC connections will not work with <em class="emphasis">mIRC</em> through
SOCKS but will with <em class="emphasis">tircproxy</em>, which intercepts
and rewrites them. <em class="emphasis">tircproxy</em> is also capable of
intercepting, denying, or sanitizing DCC and other dangerous
requests, limiting the number of attacks that are possible. It also
provides for user authentication on outgoing requests, either in the
form of genuine authentication of individual users with
username/password information (passed in cleartext) or in the form of
quiz questions intended to let all human beings through while
preventing people from using <em class="emphasis">bots</em>, programs that
take part in IRC.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch19-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">19.1.3. Network Address Translation Characteristics of IRC </h3>





Normal IRC connections do not include embedded IP addresses and work
without problems through network address translation. Some servers
will require access to an Auth server on the same apparent IP
address, so you will need to provide a mapping that will allow
inbound Auth to succeed. DCC connections are more complicated, since
they require passing IP addresses and port numbers and allowing
inbound connections. In order to allow DCC, the network address
translation system will need to understand the IRC protocol,
correctly modify the IP addresses and port numbers in DCC commands,
and accept the incoming connections associated with them.
Alternatively, you can use <em class="emphasis">tircproxy</em> in
combination with network address translation and provide static
translation for the host running <em class="emphasis">tircproxy</em>.
<em class="emphasis">tircproxy</em> will do the work of intercepting the
DCC commands.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">19.1.4. Summary of Recommendations for IRC</h3>





<ul><li>Although it's theoretically possible to proxy IRC, or to allow
just IRC through filters, it's probably not a good idea because
of the weaknesses of the clients. The best way to allow IRC is to put
an untrusted victim machine with no confidential data on a perimeter
network and let users log into that machine to run IRC.</p><p></li><li>If you run an internal IRC server, be sure it is not part of a tree
of external IRC servers; otherwise, it will effectively proxy for
your IRC clients and for attacks against them from the
outside.<a name="INDEX-1809" /></a></p><p></li></ul>
