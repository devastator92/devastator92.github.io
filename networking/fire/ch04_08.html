<h2 class="sect1">4.8. Attacks Based on Low-Level Protocol Details</h2>





As we've discussed protocols, we've also mentioned some
of the attacks against them. You will often see attacks discussed
using the names given to them by the people who wrote the original
exploit programs, which are eye-catching but not informative. These
names multiply daily, and there's no way for us to document
them all here, but we can tell you about a few of the most popular.
In fact, although there are dozens and dozens of different attacks,
they are pretty much all variations on the same few themes, and
knowing the name of the day isn't very important.</p><p>





<a name="ch04-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.1. Port Scanning</h3>





<em class="emphasis">Port scanning</em><a name="INDEX-323" />
<a name="INDEX-324" />
<a name="INDEX-325" /> is the process of looking for open
ports on a machine, in order to figure out what might be attackable.
Straightforward port scanning is quite easy to detect, so attackers
use a number of methods to disguise port scans. For instance, many
machines don't log connections until they're fully made,
so an attacker can send an initial packet, with a SYN but no ACK, get
back the response (another SYN if the port is open, a RST if it is
not), and then stop there. (This is often called a <em class="emphasis">SYN
scan</em> or a <em class="emphasis">half open scan</em>.) Although
this won't get logged, it may have other unfortunate effects,
particularly if the scanner fails to send a RST when it stops (for
instance, it may end up being a denial of service attack against the
host or some intermediate device that's trying to keep track of
open connections, like a firewall).</p><p>





Attackers may also send other packets, counting a port as closed if
they get a RST and open if they get no response, or any other error.
Almost any combination of flags other than SYN by itself can be used
for this purpose, although the most common options are FIN by itself,
all options on, and all options off. The last two possibilities,
sometimes called <em class="emphasis">Christmas tree</em> (some network
devices show the options with lights, and it makes them all light up
like a Christmas tree) and <em class="emphasis">null</em>, tend to have
unfortunate side effects on weak TCP/IP stacks. Many devices will
either crash or disable TCP/IP.<a name="INDEX-326" /> <a name="INDEX-327" /> <a name="INDEX-328" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch04-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.2. Implementation Weaknesses</h3>





<a name="INDEX-329" /><a name="INDEX-330" />Many of the
attacks that work at this level are denial of service attacks that
exploit weaknesses in TCP/IP implementations to crash machines. For
instance, <em class="emphasis">teardrop</em> and its relatives send
overlapping fragments; there are also attacks that send invalid
combinations of options, set invalid length fields, or mark data as
urgent when no application would (<em class="emphasis">winnuke</em>).</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch04-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.3. IP Spoofing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-331" /> <a name="INDEX-332" />In
IP spoofing, an attacker sends packets with an incorrect source
address. When this happens, replies will be sent to the apparent
source address, not to the attacker. This might seem to be a problem,
but actually, there are three cases where the attacker doesn't
care:</p><p>





<ul><li>The attacker can intercept the reply.</p><p></li><li>The attacker doesn't need to see the reply.</p></li><li><p>The attacker doesn't want the reply; the point of the attack is
to make the reply go somewhere else.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="ch04-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.8.3.1. The attacker can intercept the reply</h3>





If an attacker is somewhere on the network between the destination
and the forged source, the attacker may be able to see the reply and
carry on a conversation indefinitely. This is the basis of hijacking
attacks, which are discussed in more detail later. <a href="ch04_08.html#ch04-33709">Figure 4-6</a> shows an attacker using a forgery this way.</p><p>

</div>









<a name="ch04-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.8.3.2. The attacker doesn't need to see the reply</h3>





An attacker doesn't always care what the reply is. If the
attack is a denial of service, the attacked machine probably
isn't going to be able to reply anyway. Even if it isn't,
the attacker may be able to make a desired change without needing to
see the response. <a href="ch04_08.html#ch04-19846">Figure 4-7</a> shows this kind of
attack.</p><p>





<a name="ch04-19846" /><div class="figure"><img height="211" alt="Figure 4-7" src="figs/fire2.0407.gif" width="407" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-7. Attacker using forged packets for denial of service</h4>
</div>









<a name="ch04-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.8.3.3. The attacker doesn't want the reply</h3>





Several attacks rely upon the fact that the reply (or better yet,
lots of replies) will go somewhere else. The
<em class="emphasis">smurf</em> attack uses forged source addresses to
attack the host that's the apparent source; an attacker sends a
forged packet to some host he or she doesn't like very much
(call it "apparentvictim") with a source address of a
host that he or she doesn't like at all (call it
"realvictim"). "apparentvictim" then replies
to "realvictim", tying up network resources at both
victim sites but not at the attacker's actual location. The
administrators at "apparentvictim" and
"realvictim" then start arguing about who is attacking
whom and why. This attack has a number of variants using different
protocols and methods for multiplying the replies. The most common
protocols are ICMP echo and the UDP-based echo service, both of which
are discussed in <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>. The most common method
of multiplying the replies is to use a broadcast address as the
source address. <a href="ch04_08.html#ch04-61076">Figure 4-8</a> shows this kind of
attack.</p><p>





<a name="ch04-61076" /><div class="figure"><img height="220" alt="Figure 4-8" src="figs/fire2.0408.gif" width="407" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-8. Attacker using forged packets to attack a third party</h4>

The <em class="emphasis">land</em> attack sends a packet with a source
identical to the destination, which causes many machines to lock up.
<a href="ch04_08.html#ch04-24829">Figure 4-9</a> shows this kind of attack.<a name="INDEX-333" /> <a name="INDEX-334" /></p><p>





<a name="ch04-24829" /><div class="figure"><img height="210" alt="Figure 4-9" src="figs/fire2.0409.gif" width="245" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-9. Attacker using looped forged packets</h4>
</div>

<a name="ch04-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.4. Packet Interception</h3>





<a name="INDEX-335" /> <a name="INDEX-336" />Reading
packets as they go by, frequently called <em class="emphasis">packet
sniffing</em>, is a frequent way of gathering information. If
you're passing around important information unencrypted, it may
be all that an attacker needs to do.</p><p>





In order to read a packet, the attacker needs to get the packet
somehow. The easiest way to do that is to control some machine that
the traffic is supposed to go through anyway (a router or a firewall,
for instance). These machines are usually highly protected, however,
and don't usually provide tools that an attacker might want to
use.</p><p>





Usually, it's more practical for an attacker to use some
less-protected machine, but that means that the attacker needs to be
able to read packets that are not addressed to the machine itself. On
some networks, that's very easy. An Ethernet network that uses
a bus topology, or that uses 10-base T cabling with unintelligent
hubs, will send every packet on the network to every machine.
Token-ring networks, including FDDI rings, will send most or all
packets to all machines. Machines are supposed to ignore the packets
that aren't addressed to them, but anybody with full control
over a machine can override this and read all the packets, no matter
what destination they were sent to.</p><p>





Using a network switch to connect machines is supposed to avoid this
problem. A network switch, by definition, is a network device that
has multiple ports and sends traffic only to those ports that are
supposed to get it. Unfortunately, switches are not an absolute
guarantee. Most switches have an administrative function that will
allow a port to receive all traffic. Sometimes there's a single
physical port with this property, but sometimes the switch can turn
this function on for any port, so that an attacker who can subvert
the switch software can get all traffic. Furthermore, switches have
to keep track of which addresses belong to which ports, and they only
have a finite amount of space to store this information. If that
space is exhausted (for instance, because an attacker is sending fake
packets from many different addresses), the switch will fail. Some of
them will stop sending packets anywhere; others will simply send all
packets to all ports; and others provide a configuration parameter to
allow you to choose a failure mode.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-337" /> <a name="INDEX-338" />Some switches offer increased
separation of traffic with a facility called a Virtual Local Area
Network (VLAN). On a normal switch, all the ports are part of the
same network. A switch that supports VLANs will be able to treat
different ports as parts of different networks. Traffic is only
supposed to go between ports on different VLANs if a router is
involved, just as if the ports were on completely separate switches.
Normal tricks to confuse switches will compromise only one VLAN.
VLANs are a convenient tool in many situations, and they provide a
small measure of increased security over a plain switched network.
However, you are still running all of the traffic through a single
device, which could be compromised. There are known attacks that will
move traffic from one VLAN to another in most implementations, and
almost any administrative error will compromise the separation. You
should not rely on VLANs to provide strong, secure separation between
networks.<a name="INDEX-339" />
