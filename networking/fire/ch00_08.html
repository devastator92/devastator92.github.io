<h2 class="sect1">0.8. Acknowledgments for the Second Edition</h2>





As unlikely as it may seem, we still had no idea how much time and
effort the second edition would take when we started working on it;
what we expected to be a relatively simple effort has turned into a
marathon. Even the smallest revision requires many hands, and a fully
new edition requires what seems like a cast of thousands.</p><p>





Thanks to those who reviewed the second edition and made helpful
comments: Steve Beaty, David LeBlanc, Phil Cox, Eric Pearce, Chuck
Phillips, Greg Rose, and Wietse Venema -- and to Bruce Schneier
and Diana Smetters who read <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a> on a four-hour turnaround!
Thanks to the entire editorial and production team at O'Reilly,
especially project manager Madeleine Newell and production editor
Nancy Crumpton.</p><p>





Elizabeth says: My thanks to my friends, family, and colleagues for
their patience and aid; my monomaniacal interest in network protocols
coupled with emotional instability and intermittent overwork have
required more than a reasonable and customary amount of tolerance. I
am particularly indebted to Arnold Zwicky, Diana Smetters, Jeanne
Dusseault, and Brent Chapman. Special thanks are due to my second
father, Jacques Transue, who required me to take slow and calm breaks
from writing. Thanks to Debby Russell and Sue Miller at
O'Reilly for their deft, patient, and calm job of editing; and
to Simon, who expected a simple writing project, got his life
disrupted for more than a year and a half, and kept working anyway,
even though we insisted on spelling everything in American instead of
proper English. And thanks to the many O'Reilly people who
helped to produce this book.</p><p>





Simon says: I would like to thank my colleagues, my friends, and my
family for their understanding and support during this project.
Particular thanks go to Beryl Cooper, Mel Pleasant, Landon Curt Noll,
Greg Bossert, James R. Martin II, Alesia Bischoff, and Cherry Mill
for their encouragement and patience. A special mention goes to my
ice hockey teammates -- thanks for such an active alternative to
writing. Enormous thanks to Elizabeth for asking me to coauthor and
for coaching me through the process. Finally, thanks to Debby, Sue,
and the staff of O'Reilly for putting this book into the hands
of our readers.</p><p>
