<h2 class="sect1">14.7. Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1333" />
<a name="INDEX-1334" /><a name="INDEX-1335" />The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) was
designed in 1993 by Netscape to provide end-to-end encryption,
integrity protection, and server authentication for the Web. The
security services libraries that were available at the time
didn't provide certain features that were needed for the Web:</p><p>





<ul><li>Strong public key authentication without the need for a globally
deployed public key infrastructure.</p><p></li><li>Reasonable performance with the large number of short connections
made necessary by the stateless nature of HTTP. State associated with
SSL can be maintained, at the server's discretion, across a
sequence of HTTP connections.</p><p></li><li>The ability for clients to remain anonymous while requiring server
authentication.</p><p></li></ul>
Like most network protocols, SSL has undergone a number of revisions.
The commonly found versions of SSL are version 2 and version 3. There
are known problems with the cryptography in version 2. The
cryptography used in SSL version 3 contains some significant
differences from its predecessor and is considered to be free of the
previous version's cryptographic weaknesses. SSL version 3 also
provides a clean way to use new versions of the protocol for forward
compatibility. Unless otherwise noted, this discussion refers to SSL
version 3; we suggest that you avoid using SSL version 2.</p><p>





The SSL protocol is owned by Netscape (and they own a U.S. patent
relating to SSL), but they approached the IETF to create an Internet
standard. An IETF protocol definition, RFC 2246, is in the process of
becoming an Internet standard. The protocol is based very heavily on
SSL version 3 and is called Transport <a name="INDEX-1336" />Layer Security (TLS). Both TLS and SSL
use exactly the same protocol greeting and version extensibility
mechanism. This allows servers to be migrated from supporting SSL to
TLS, and provisions have been made so that services can be created
that support both SSL version 3 and TLS. Netscape has granted a
royalty-free license for the SSL patent for any applications that use
TLS as part of an IETF standard protocol.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.1. The TLS and SSL Protocols</h3>





The TLS and SSL protocols provide server and client authentication,
end-to-end encryption, and integrity protection. They also allow a
client to reconnect to a server it has already used without having to
reauthenticate or negotiate new session keys, as long as the new
connection is made shortly after the old one is closed down.</p><p>





The security of TLS and SSL does not come purely from the fact that
they use a specific encryption algorithm, cryptographic hash, or
public key cryptography, but from the way the algorithms are used.
The important characteristics of a secure private communication
session are discussed in <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>





Both TLS and SSL meet the characteristics for providing a secure
private communication session because:</p><p>





<ul><li>The client and server negotiate encryption and integrity protection
algorithms.</p><p></li><li>The identity of the server a client is connecting to is always
verified, and this identity check is performed before the optional
client user authentication information is sent.</p><p></li><li>The key exchange algorithms that are used prevent man-in-the-middle
attacks.</p><p></li><li>At the end of the key exchange is a checksum exchange that will
detect any tampering with algorithm negotiation.</p><p></li><li>The server can check the identity of a client in a number of ways
(these mechanisms are discussed in the next section). It is also
possible to have anonymous clients.</p><p></li><li>All data packets exchanged include message integrity checks. An
integrity check failure causes a connection to be closed.</p><p></li><li>It is possible, using certain sets of negotiated algorithms, to use
temporary authentication parameters that will be discarded after a
configurable time period to prevent recorded sessions from being
decrypted at a later time.</p><p></li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.2. Cryptography in TLS and SSL</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1337" />
<a name="INDEX-1338" />TLS and SSL do not depend on a single
algorithm for each of the following: generating keys, encrypting
data, or performing authentication. Instead, they can use a range of
different algorithms. Not all combinations of algorithms are valid,
and both TLS and SSL define suites of algorithms that should be used
together. This flexibility provides a number of advantages:</p><p>





<ul><li>Different algorithms have different capabilities; supporting multiple
ones allows an application to choose one particularly suited to the
kind of data and transaction patterns that it uses.</p><p></li><li>There is frequently a trade-off between strength and speed;
supporting multiple different algorithms allows applications to use
faster but weaker methods when security is less important.</p><p></li><li>As time goes by, people find ways to break algorithms that were
previously considered secure; supporting a range allows applications
to stop using algorithms that are no longer considered secure.</p><p></li></ul>
The TLS protocol defines sets of algorithms that can be used
together. There is only one algorithm suite that an application must
implement in order to be called a TLS compliant application. Even
then, if a standard for the application prevents it from using this
base algorithm suite, it may implement a different one and still be
called TLS compliant. The required algorithm suite is a
Diffie-Hellman key exchange authenticated with the Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) with triple DES used in cipher block-chaining mode
with SHA cryptographic hashes. The most important thing to know about
this string of cryptographic terms is that at this time, this
algorithm suite provides strong encryption and authentication
suitable for protecting sensitive information. For more information
about specific cryptographic algorithms and key lengths, see <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>.</p><p>





Some algorithm suites use public key cryptography which, depending on
the application, may require the use of additional network services
(such as LDAP for verifying digital certificates) in order to perform
server or client authentication.</p><p>





TLS allows clients to be authenticated using either DSS or RSA public
key cryptography. If clients wish to use other forms of
authentication, such as a token card or a password, they must
authenticate with the server anonymously, and then the application
must negotiate to perform the additional authentication. This is the
method which a web browser using TLS or SSL uses to perform HTTP
basic authentication.</p><p>

<a name="ch14-30-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.3. Use of TLS and SSL by Other Protocols</h3>





In order for TLS and SSL to be useful, they have to be used in
conjunction with some higher-level protocol that actually exchanges
data between applications. In some cases, this is done by integrating
them into new protocols; for instance, version 2 of the Secure Shell
(SSH) protocol uses TLS. However, in other situations it's
useful to add TLS or SSL to an existing protocol. There are two basic
mechanisms for doing this. One way is to use a new port number for
the combination of the old protocol and the encrypting protocol; this
is the way SSL and HTTP were originally integrated to create HTTPS.
The other common way of integrating TLS or SSL into an existing
protocol is to add a command to the protocol that starts up an
encrypted session over the existing port; this is the approach taken
by ESMTP when using the STARTTLS extension.</p><p>





Neither of these approaches is perfect. Using a new port number is
relatively easy to implement (you don't have to change command
parsers) and allows a firewall to easily distinguish between
protected and unprotected versions of the protocol (so that you can
require the use of TLS, for instance). However, it uses up port
numbers (and there are only 1024 in the reserved range to be
allocated), and it requires changing firewall configurations to
permit TLS-protected connections.</p><p>





Adding a new command to start up a TLS connection makes more
efficient use of port numbers and increases the chances that the
upgraded protocol will work through firewalls (it may still be denied
by an intelligent proxy that's watching the commands that are
used). However, it's harder to implement. In particular,
it's hard to make sure that no important data is exchanged
before TLS is started up. Furthermore, it's critical for
programmers to be cautious about failure conditions. A server or
client that supports TLS needs to fail gracefully when talking to one
that doesn't. However, if both the server and the client
support TLS, it should not be possible for an attacker to force them
to converse unprotected by interfering with the negotiation to use
TLS.</p><p>





In addition, once a protocol has upgraded to using TLS, it should
restart all protocol negotiation from the beginning. Any information
from the unprotected protocol could have been modified by an attacker
and cannot be trusted.<a name="INDEX-1339" /></p><p>

<a name="ch14-31-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.4. Packet Filtering Characteristics of TLS and SSL</h3>





Neither TLS nor SSL is associated with an assigned port, although
there are a number of ports assigned to specific higher-level
protocols running over one or the other. We list these ports along
with any other ports assigned to the higher-level protocols (for
instance, we list the port assigned to IMAP over SSL in the section
on packet filtering characteristics of IMAP in <a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Electronic Mail and News"</a>). You will sometimes see port 443 shown as
assigned to SSL, but in fact, it is assigned to HTTP over SSL.</p><p>





TLS and SSL connections will always be straightforward TCP
connections, but that does not prevent higher-level protocols that
use them from also using other connections or protocols. Because of
the end-to-end encryption, it is impossible to do intelligent packet
filtering on TLS and SSL connections; there is no way for a packet
filter to enforce restrictions on what higher-level protocols are
being run, for instance.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch14-32-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.5. Proxying Characteristics of TLS and SSL</h3>





Because TLS and SSL use straightforward TCP connections, they work
well with generic proxies. Proxying provides very little additional
protection with TLS and SSL, because there is no way for a proxy to
see the content of packets to do intelligent logging, control, or
content filtering; a proxy can only control where connections are
made.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch14-33-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.6. Network Address Translation Characteristics of  TLS and SSL</h3>





TLS and SSL will work well with network address translation. However,
the end-to-end encryption will prevent the network address
translation system from intercepting embedded addresses. Higher-level
protocols that depend on having correct address or hostname
information in their data will not work, and it will not be possible
for the network address translation system to protect you from
inadvertently releasing information about your internal network
configuration.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch14-34-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.7. Summary of Recommendations for TLS and SSL</h3>





<ul><li>TLS and SSL version 3 are good choices for adding end-to-end
protection to applications.</p><p></li><li>Use TLS and SSL version 3 to protect against eavesdropping, session
hijacking, and Trojan servers.</p><p></li><li>Use TLS or SSL version 3 rather than SSL version 2. TLS should be
preferred over SSL version 3.</p><p></li><li>When evaluating programs that use TLS or SSL to add protection to
existing protocols, verify that the transition to a protected
connection occurs before confidential data is exchanged. Ideally any
higher-level protocol negotiation should be completely restarted once
protection has been established.<a name="INDEX-1340" /></p><p></li></ul>
