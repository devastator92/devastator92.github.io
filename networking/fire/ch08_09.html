<h2 class="sect1">8.9. Packet Filtering Implementations for General-Purpose Computers</h2>





These days, a number of operating systems provide packet filtering
features, independent of firewall products. Many Unix variants come
with packet filtering, as does Windows NT.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-612" />There are two
major reasons why you might want to use packet filtering
implementations on general-purpose computers. First, you may want to
use a general-purpose computer as a router (either providing only
packet filtering, or as a single-box firewall that provides both
packet filtering and proxying). In this case, you are using the
general-purpose computer to provide the same sort of packet filtering
services that a router would provide. Second, you may be using the
general-purpose computer as a bastion host, and you may want to use
packet filtering on the computer as a security measure to protect the
computer itself.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-25-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.9.1. Linux ipchains and Masquerading</h3>





<a name="INDEX-613" /> <a name="INDEX-614" />The
Linux kernel includes a packet filtering system called
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em>, which provides powerful packet
filtering capabilities. This system provides the same sorts of
capabilities that you would get from a modern packet filtering router
and is suitable for using where you'd use a router. Because
it's part of the standard Linux kernel source, it should be
present in all up-to-date Linux distributions, although it may not be
enabled by default.</p><p>





Earlier Linux kernels used a filtering system called
<em class="emphasis">ipfw</em> (which was a port of a BSD filtering
system) and a configuration utility called
<em class="emphasis">ipfwadm</em>. <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> is a new
filtering system, which provides more functionality than
<em class="emphasis">ipfw</em>. <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> allows you
to convert configuration files from <em class="emphasis">ipfwadm</em> to
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em>.</p><p>





The filtering performed by <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> is done
entirely in the kernel, and it requires only a single external
utility to initialize the filtering rules. This means that it is
possible to build a complete Linux filtering system that will fit on
a single 1.44 MB floppy disk. The Linux Router Project is doing
exactly this (see <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>, for more information
about the Linux Router Project).</p><p>





Linux also has a facility called <em class="emphasis">masquerading,</em>
which is used with <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> to provide network
address translation for both TCP and UDP. Masquerading keeps track of
TCP connection state and supports timeout-based UDP requests and
responses. Because it must be used with packet filtering, it can be
considered a dynamic packet filtering system. In addition to
providing straightforward network address translation for simple TCP
and UDP protocols, Linux masquerading allows additional kernel
modules to be loaded for more complicated protocols (for instance,
FTP and RealAudio, which require reverse TCP connections or
additional UDP ports).</p><p>





<a name="ch08-26-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.9.1.1. ipchains </h3>





<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> is designed around the concept of a
chain of rules. Each rule specifies a condition and an action to take
if the condition is met, called a <em class="emphasis">target</em>. The
rules in a chain are used in order; a packet is checked against each
rule in turn, and if the packet matches the condition, the specified
action is taken.</p><p>





There are three standard chains, called the input, output, and
forward chains. All packets coming in to the machine are passed
through the <em class="emphasis">input</em> <em class="emphasis">chain</em>,
and all packets going out of the machine are passed though the
<em class="emphasis">output</em> <em class="emphasis">chain</em>. The
<em class="emphasis">forward</em> <em class="emphasis">chain</em> is used for
packets that need to be sent to a different network interface from
the one they were received on. Thus, if a packet is received for the
machine, it's matched against the input chain; if the machine
generates a packet, it's matched against the output chain. If
the machine is acting as a router and gets a packet addressed to some
other machine, the packet will be matched against all three chains.</p><p>





The standard chains each have a default policy, which is applied when
no rules match. It is also possible to create additional,
user-defined, chains. If no rules match when checking a user-defined
chain, processing will continue at the point where the chain was
called.</p><p>





The conditions in a rule can be based on any of the following:</p><p>





<ul><li>The IP protocol number (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, or IGMP).</p><p></li><li>The source and destination IP addresses. Addresses can be specified
as a variable-length subnet (e.g., 192.168.8.0/22) or a network
address with a mask, and negation is allowed (you can specify
"all addresses except those that match this address and
mask").</p><p></li><li>The source and destination TCP and UDP port numbers. Port numbers can
be specified with ranges or masks, and negation is allowed.</p><p></li><li>The ICMP type and code.</p></li><li>Whether the packet is an IP fragment.</p></li><li><p>Whether the packet is a TCP start-of-connection packet.</p></li><li><p>The network interface. This is the interface the packet came in on
for the input chain and the destination interface for the output and
forward chains.</p><p></li></ul>
Each rule in a chain has a target action that is applied when the
rule matches. The target of a rule decides what next happens to a
packet. The allowed targets are:</p><p>





<ul><li>Deny: Drop the packet without generating a response.</p><p></li><li>Reject: Don't process the packet, but generate an ICMP response
(which will be passed though the output chain).</p><p></li><li>Accept: Process the packet.</p></li><li>Masq: Perform masquerading. This target is only valid in the forward
chain.</p><p></li><li>Redirect: Forward the packet to a different port on the local machine.</p></li><li>Return: Apply the default policy for a built-in chain or continue
processing at the point where a user-defined chain was called.</p><p></li><li>A user-defined chain.</p></li></ul>
Because a user-defined chain can be the target of a rule, it is
possible to build complex filters or make
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> behave like other packet filtering
systems.</p><p>





A rule can also make a log entry, which contains information about
the action that was taken, the time, and a summary of the packet
headers. Logging is performed by <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">8.9.1.2. Testing ipchains rules</h3>





<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> has a very useful feature that allows
the kernel-filtering rules to be tested. The
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> command allows you to specify IP header
values to be tested against the currently loaded kernel filtering
rules. Using the standard target names, the command prints how the
kernel would react if the packet had really been sent to the
firewall. At the time of writing, it is not possible to generate and
test arbitrary packets.<a name="INDEX-615" /> <a name="INDEX-616" /></p><p>

<a name="ch08-28-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.9.1.3. Masquerading</h3>





<a name="INDEX-617" />
<a name="INDEX-618" />Linux
masquerading is a network address translation system. Because it is
capable of working at higher protocol levels, and doing more
intricate modifications than simple address changes, it's also
called a <em class="emphasis">transparent proxying system</em>. What it
does could be considered either proxying or packet filtering;
it's somewhere in between the two.</p><p>





The IP address of the firewall is used in communicating with remote
services. For simple protocols, masquerading alters only IP header
information, including IP addresses, port numbers, and TCP sequence
and acknowledgment numbers. Masquerading uses the IP address of the
host doing the masquerading as the externally visible address, and
maps the port number into one from a pool of 4096 ports starting at
61000. This fixed allocation of ports does limit Linux masquerading
to 4096 simultaneous TCP connections and 4096 UDP ports. At the time
of writing, Linux kernels allocate only ports less than 32768, so the
ports used for masquerading will never conflict with ports used for
other purposes.</p><p>





Linux masquerading is also capable of dealing with more complicated
protocols, such as FTP or RealAudio, which might require reverse TCP
connections or additional UDP ports. Support for new protocols can be
added by dynamically loading new kernel modules.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch08-29-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.9.1.4. How masquerading works</h3>





asquerading works by intercepting packets that are being forwarded
by the Linux kernel. Masquerading for simple protocols works much
like simple network address translation, as described in <a href="ch05_01.html#ch05-1614">Section 5.1, "Some Firewall Definitions"</a>. IP addresses and port numbers are modified on
outgoing packets. For TCP connections, a new sequence number is
generated. The process is reversed for incoming packets. <a href="ch08_09.html#ch08-67499">Figure 8-5</a> is an example of this working for a client
connecting to a remote HTTP server, and shows the IP address and
ports for each half of the connection. The masquerading firewall will
continue to pass packets back to the client as long as the client
maintains the outgoing half of the TCP connection. In the case of
UDP, the firewall will pass packets back to the client only for a
configurable time period, which is typically set to 15-30 seconds.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-67499" /><div class="figure"><img height="177" alt="Figure 8-5" src="figs/fire2.0805.gif" width="477" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-5. Masquerading for simple outgoing protocols</h4>

In addition to handling outgoing traffic, masquerading can be used to
forward incoming ports to internal services. The ability to
masquerade incoming ports is configured statically for each port that
is to be forwarded. Once a port is forwarded, it can no longer be
used to connect to a service on the firewall. <a href="ch08_09.html#ch08-57357">Figure 8-6</a> shows a masquerading firewall configured to
forward SSH to an internal destination and includes the IP addresses
and port numbers for each half of the connection. It's possible
to forward the same port to multiple destinations if the masquerading
firewall is configured to listen to multiple IP addresses.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-57357" /><div class="figure"><img height="177" alt="Figure 8-6" src="figs/fire2.0806.gif" width="477" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-6. Forwarding incoming services using masquerading</h4>

For more complicated protocols, masquerading can set up additional
listening TCP and UDP ports based upon the contents of packets that
have been seen. Masquerading can even rewrite the contents of data
packets in order to replace IP addresses and port numbers.</p><p>





This is best explained by describing how the masquerading module for
FTP works. As we discuss in <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>, FTP is a
tricky protocol to support through a firewall because it normally
involves a connection from the server to the client. An FTP client
opens a control channel to a desired FTP server. At the point where
data is to be transferred, the client issues a PORT command that
contains the client IP address and a port number the client expects
to receive the data on. The FTP server uses this information to open
a new TCP connection to the client in order to transfer the data.</p><p>





For masquerading to work, it must intercept the PORT command from the
client. The FTP masquerading module does this by listening to the
commands sent over all FTP control channels. When it sees a PORT
command, it does two things; first, it sets up a temporary port on
the masquerading host, which is forwarded to the port the client
specified. Next, it rewrites the IP packet containing the PORT
command with the IP address of the firewall and the temporary port.
When an incoming connection to the temporary port is made, it is
forwarded to the client. <a href="ch08_09.html#ch08-68449">Figure 8-7</a> describes this
process.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect3">8.9.1.5. Available specialized masquerading modules </h3>





A number of specialized masquerading modules are available. At the
time of writing, they can be split into three categories: multimedia,
games, and access to internal services. An up-to-date list of modules
and their availability can be found in the Linux MASQUERADING-HOWTO.
See <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>, for information on how to obtain
Linux HOWTO documents.</p><p>

<a name="ch08-31-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.9.1.6. Using ipchains (including masquerading)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-619" /> <a name="INDEX-620" />To
use <em class="emphasis">ipchains,</em> you must compile it into the
kernel you are using. The actual kernel compilation flags for turning
it on are different in different Linux releases; you should either
consult help for your Linux kernel configuration utility or use the
Linux IPCHAINS-HOWTO. See <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a> for
information on obtaining Linux HOWTO documents.</p><p>





We also recommend that you turn on fragment reassembly. See <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>, for information on IP fragmentation and why
this is important.</p><p>





asquerading is included as a standard part of Linux 2.1 and 2.2
kernel source code. It does need to be enabled when the kernel is
compiled, and it also depends on the Linux firewalling code. The
kernel compile-time option for enabling Linux masquerading is
CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE=Y.</p><p>





In order to use all of the facilities of
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> and masquerading, you will also need
the <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> and <em class="emphasis">ipmasqadm</em>
commands used to define the filtering and masquerading rules.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> rules are built incrementally; when the
machine boots, it installs the rules in order, so there will be a
brief period while it is initializing when the chain is not fully
built, and the default policy will be used before the end of the
chain has been configured. If the default policy is to accept
packets, you may accept packets that you would otherwise have denied.
You should therefore put in an initial explicit default policy that
denies packets.</p><p>





One tempting way to avoid this problem is to build the chains before
you actually configure the network interfaces (if you can't
receive the packets, there's no need to worry about what you do
with them). In most situations, this won't work because rules
will be rejected if they refer to network interfaces that
haven't been configured. If you have a configuration of the
kind we recommend, you will have to configure the network interface
before you can build the chains you are actually going to use. Thus,
you will end up using two bootup scripts for the
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> configuration. The first script will
initialize default deny policies for each chain; the second will load
the rules you wish to use. When combined with the network interface
configuration scripts, this will result in the following three-stage
process:</p><p>





<ol><li>Load default deny polices that do not specify an interface.</p><p></li><li>Configure the network interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Load the real <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> rules you're going
to use.</p><p></li></ol>
Since the default policy does not do any logging, it is often useful
to duplicate it with a final rule that will also log denied traffic.
In other packet filtering situations, we recommend doing this for
documentation purposes; in this case, you have already documented the
default with the initial default policy, but you need both in order
to combine security and logging.</p><p>





When masquerading is operating, the standard Unix
<em class="emphasis">netstat</em> program does not list masqueraded ports.
This means that the machine will be accepting packets for ports that
don't show up when you run <em class="emphasis">netstat</em>, which
may be disconcerting to experienced network administrators.<a name="INDEX-621" /><a name="INDEX-622" /> <a name="INDEX-623" /></p><p>

<a name="ch08-32-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.9.2. ipfilter</h3>





<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em><a name="INDEX-624" /> <a name="INDEX-625" />
<a name="INDEX-626" />
is another packet filtering system for Unix. It works on the free BSD
implementations (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD) and has also been
ported to and tested on other Unix operating systems including
Solaris and previous versions of SunOS, IRIX, and Linux.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> uses a list of rules contained in a
single configuration file. Unlike <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em>,
<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> checks all rules in sequence, and the
last rule that successfully matches determines the fate of a packet.
This can be a great source of confusion. Imagine a filtering
configuration file containing only the following rules:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">block in all
pass in all</pre></blockquote>





This will pass all packets because the second rule is the last rule
that matches. Fortunately an <em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> rule can
specify the "quick" keyword, which if the rule matches,
will terminate the rule checking at that point. The following rules
would block all traffic:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">block in quick all
pass in all</pre></blockquote>





Rules may be arranged into groups, which allows you to make more
complicated configurations quite easily. A group has a head rule,
which is checked to determine whether the rest of the rules in the
group are executed. If the group is executed, the rules in it are
handled in the normal way. At the end of the group, processing
continues at the next line.</p><p>





The conditions in a rule can be based on any of the following:</p><p>





<ul><li>The IP protocol number (for example TCP, UDP, ICMP, or IGMP).</p><p></li><li>The IP options that are set.</p></li><li><p>The source and destination IP addresses. Addresses can be specified
as a variable-length subnet (for example 192.168.8.0/22) or a network
address with a mask, and negation is allowed (you can specify
"all addresses except those that match this address and
mask").</p><p></li><li>The source and destination TCP and UDP port numbers. Port numbers can
be specified with ranges or masks, and negation is allowed.</p><p></li><li>The ICMP type and code.</p></li><li>Whether the packet is an IP fragment. Fragments that are too short to
contain port numbers, and thus could prevent port rules from being
applied, can be explicitly handled.</p><p></li><li>The TCP flags that are set (for instance, the ACK and SYN bits that
let you identify a start of connection packet).</p><p></li><li>The network interface the packet came in on.</p></li></ul>
The actions <em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> can take are:</p><p>





<ul><li>Drop the packet without generating a response.</p><p></li><li>Don't process the packet, but return an ICMP response (you can
specify what ICMP response to return).</p><p></li><li>Don't process the packet, but return a TCP reset.</p></li><li>Process the packet.</p></li><li><p>Process the packet, keeping state information to make sure that all
TCP packets are part of a valid TCP conversation, with appropriate
settings of SYN and ACK and appropriate sequence numbers.</p><p></li><li>Change IP address and/or port number information in the packet using
a static mapping (this is a simple form of network address
translation).</p><p></li><li>Send the packet or a copy of it to a specified network interface or
address for logging purposes.</p><p></li><li>Log information about the packet via <em class="emphasis">syslog</em>.</p></li></ul>
<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> also has the ability to do some more
complicated packet rewriting to support protocols that cannot be
handled by straightforward network address translation. However,
there are relatively few supported protocols. The rewriting system in
<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> is not dynamically extensible;
rewriting capabilities are set at compile time and cannot be added on
the fly.<a name="INDEX-627" />

<h3 class="sect2">8.9.3. Comparing ipfilter and ipchains</h3>





<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em><a name="INDEX-630" />
<a name="INDEX-631" /> <a name="INDEX-632" />
<a name="INDEX-633" /> and <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em>
provide roughly the same functionality; in many cases, people choose
between them based on the operating system they're using, using
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> on Linux and
<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> on other operating systems. On the
other hand, they do have distinct strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> is much stronger as a network address
translation system. The network address translation functionality
provided by <em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> is minimal and is not
dynamically updatable. <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> is also provided
as part of Linux, so that it doesn't require separate
integration.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> provides filtering capabilities that
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> does not (allowing you to filter on IP
options and providing more flexible handling of TCP options, for
instance), and it is more flexible about the responses it gives to
blocked packets. Its packet duplication features are useful for
feeding packets to intrusion detection systems.</p><p>





The architecture of <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> makes it much
easier to extend than <em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em>, so it's
likely that the extra <em class="emphasis">ipfilter</em> features will
eventually show up in <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em>. However,
<em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> is relatively tightly integrated with
the Linux kernel, which will slow down its spread to other operating
systems.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch08-34-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.9.4. Linux netfilter</h3>





<a name="INDEX-634" />
<a name="INDEX-635" />At
this writing, the Linux packet filtering and network address
translation systems are being rewritten. The new filtering system is
called <em class="emphasis">netfilter</em>, and it has several goals. One
is to reduce the number of points in the Linux kernel where filtering
occurs. Another is to have a clean separation of filtering from
network address translation. As a result of this separation,
<em class="emphasis">netfilter</em> is no longer capable of modifying
packets. Some of the concepts from <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em>
still exist in <em class="emphasis">netfilter</em>; in particular, lists
of filtering rules are built into named chains. The significant
features that have been added to <em class="emphasis">netfilter</em> are:</p><p>





<ul><li>The ability to filter on both the input and output interface in the
forward chain</p><p></li><li>The ability to pass packets to user-level processes for handling</p></li></ul>
If you are using <em class="emphasis">ipchains</em> only for packet
filtering, you can use <em class="emphasis">netfilter</em> with the same
filtering rules. However, if you use the masquerading chain, you will
need to convert to using the new network address translation tools in
order to use <em class="emphasis">netfilter</em>.</p><p>

<a name="ch08-35-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.9.5. Windows NT Packet Filtering</h3>





<a name="INDEX-636" /> <a name="INDEX-637" />Windows NT 4 comes with a very limited
ability to do packet filtering, suitable only for protecting the
machine itself, and that only in some circumstances. From the Network
control panel, when you are configuring TCP/IP properties, you can go
to the IP address tab and select Advanced. You have two different
ways of doing filtering:</p><p>





<ul><li>The Enable PPTP Filtering button will restrict the interface to only
using PPTP.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-20">[20]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-20" />[20]See <a href="ch14_01.html#ch14-4739">Section 14.1, "Remote Procedure Call (RPC)"</a>, for more
information about PPTP.</p><p>




</blockquote></li><li>The Configure button under Enable Security will let you configure
filtering by TCP port, UDP port, or IP protocol.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-638" />Windows 2000 provides the latter filtering
also, as part of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings; it is under the
Options tab and is called TCP/IP filtering. You may specify that you
wish to allow everything, or you may provide a list of what you will
allow, by individual port number (that is, if you wish to allow ports
above 1023, you will have to enter each number from 1024 to 65536
separately).</p><p>





This packet filtering is extremely minimal, and there are very few
situations where it's possible to use it. It is useful for
machines that are using PPTP, or that are bastion hosts providing
single services like HTTP. Some of the problems with it are not
immediately obvious and are frequently unpleasant surprises to people
trying to use this packet filtering:</p><p>





<ul><li>It controls only incoming packets without ACK set; it will not limit
outbound connections.</p><p></li><li>The "IP protocol" entries do not control UDP and TCP; if
you wish to deny UDP and TCP, you must set the TCP and UDP entries to
allow only specified ports and then avoid specifying any ports.</p><p></li><li>It will not deny ICMP, even if you set the IP protocol to allow only
specified ports and avoid including ICMP.</p><p></li></ul>
If you install the Routing and Remote Access Service for Windows NT 4
or Windows 2000, which is a no-cost option, you get much more
flexible packet filtering, allowing both inbound and outbound filters
by protocol, source and destination address, and source and
destination port. This filtering still doesn't compete with
full-fledged packet filtering implementations; it doesn't allow
specifications of port ranges, it doesn't give you any control
over what's done with denied packets, and it doesn't
allow you to combine allow and deny rules.</p><p>





Windows 2000 provides packet filtering in a third place as part of
its implementation of IPsec (IPsec is discussed further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>). This packet filtering is comparable to the
Routing and Remote Access Service filtering for Windows NT 4, except
that it is possible to combine filters into sets (allowing you to mix
allow and deny rules), and a rule can apply four possible actions:</p><p>





<ul><li>Permit all packets that match, regardless of their IPsec status.</p><p></li><li>Block all packets that match, regardless of their IPsec status.</p></li><li><p>Request IPsec protections on all packets that match, but accept them
if IPsec is not available.</p><p></li><li>Require IPsec protections on all packets that match, and reject them
if IPsec is not available.</p><p></li></ul>
If you are using packet filtering as part of IPsec, we strongly
recommend that you avoid configuring any of the other possible sorts
of packet filtering. Use only one packet filtering package at a time;
otherwise, you risk configuring conflicting filtering rules. Whether
or not the computer gets confused, its maintainers certainly will.</p><p>





Ironically, the most powerful packet filtering package that Microsoft
makes available for Windows NT is actually part of Microsoft's
Proxy Server. While it still does not provide all of the features
that a packet filtering router would provide, it does include
alerting and logging options, specification of port ranges, and
filtering of fragments. As of this writing, a new version of Proxy
Server is due out shortly, and it is expected to have still more
packet filtering features.<a name="INDEX-639" /> <a name="INDEX-640" /><a name="INDEX-641" /></p><p>
