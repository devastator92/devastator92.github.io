<h2 class="sect1">14.11. Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1350" /> <a name="INDEX-1351" />PPTP is an encapsulation protocol
based on the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and the Generic Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) protocol. PPP was originally designed to
facilitate using IP and similar protocols over dialup connections and
provides a general way to encapsulate protocols at the level of IP.
PPTP is an extension of PPP, which takes PPP packets, encrypts them,
and encapsulates them in GRE packets. <a href="ch14_11.html#ch14-84421">Figure 14-3</a>
shows the layers of encapsulation involved in sending a TCP packet
via PPTP. Since PPP supports encapsulating multiple protocols, so
does PPTP. It is most often used to provide virtual private
networking, tunneling IP over IP, but it can also be used to tunnel
non-IP protocols like IPX.</p><p>

Since PPTP tunnels packets over IP, there must be an IP-level
connection between the hosts. In many situations, that connection
allows the hosts to be attacked using other protocols. For instance,
if you are using PPTP as a virtual private network across the
Internet, the hosts have some sort of Internet connection and will
have all the normal vulnerabilities of Internet-connected hosts. You
will need to disable all non-PPTP connections or otherwise protect
the machines. In particular, we recommend avoiding PPTP products that
allow traffic to or from the host to use the underlying network
directly.</p><p>





There's been a great deal of controversy over the security of
PPTP. Some of this has been due to weaknesses in Microsoft
implementations of PPTP, many of which have been fixed. However,
there are some design weaknesses in PPTP as well.</p><p>





<a name="ch14-40-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.11.1. Design Weaknesses in PPTP</h3>





Although PPTP is an encrypted protocol, not all the parts of the
conversation are encrypted. Before the PPTP server starts accepting
the GRE packets, a negotiation takes place over TCP. PPTP encryption
protects the information being tunneled but not the negotiation
involved in setting up the tunnel. The negotiation is done in
cleartext and includes client and server IP addresses, the name and
software version information about the client, the username, and
sometimes the hashed password used for authentication. All of this
information is exposed to eavesdropping.</p><p>





This negotiation is also done before the client has to authenticate,
which makes the server particularly vulnerable to hostile clients. An
attacker doesn't have to be able to authenticate in order to
engage the server in negotiation, tying up resources and potentially
confusing the server.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch14-41-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.11.2. Implementation Weaknesses in PPTP</h3>





As we discussed earlier, PPTP sends authentication information in
cleartext. In many versions of Microsoft PPTP, this information can
include a LanMan hash of the user's password. As described in
<a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, it is relatively easy to use a LanMan
hash to discover a password. You can disable Lan Manager
authentication and should do so on all clients and servers you
control. This will force the authentication to use more secure
Windows NT password hashes.</p><p>





icrosoft's implementation also has problems with the
encryption. Microsoft offers two levels of encryption, both using the
symmetric key encryption algorithm called RC4; one uses a 40-bit key,
and the other uses a 128-bit key. (See <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>,
for more information on RC4 and the importance of key length.) The
40-bit RC4 algorithm is not particularly strong to begin with, and
icrosoft weakens it further by basing the key on the user's
password, so that a user will have multiple sessions with the same
key. The longer a key is used, the stronger it needs to be, and the
time between password changes may be a very long time indeed.</p><p>





When 128-bit keys are in use, Microsoft bases the key on the
user's password and on a pseudo-random number so that
it's different for each connection. This is a major
improvement, although using the user's password does reduce the
number of probable keys and makes it important for PPTP users to have
good passwords.</p><p>





ost PPTP implementations, including Microsoft's, are
susceptible to problems with control negotiations. As we pointed out
earlier, these negotiations take place before the client
authentication, which means that any attacker can send them.
It's therefore extremely important for servers to be able to
deal with bad negotiations, but in fact, many servers will crash if
they receive garbled negotiations, and some will crash even when sent
random garbage that bears no resemblance to a valid negotiation.
Although Microsoft offers an option to control PPTP access by source
IP address, it's enforced on the GRE tunnel, not on the
TCP-based negotiation. If you are doing PPTP from known source
addresses, you can protect the PPTP server with a packet filter in
front of it; if you are not, you have no choice but to live with
these denial of service attacks.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.11.3. Packet Filtering Characteristics of PPTP</h3>





PPTP negotiation takes place on TCP port 1723. The actual tunnel is
based on GRE, which is IP protocol 47, and uses GRE protocol
hexadecimal 880B (indicating that the tunneled packets are PPP). GRE
is discussed further in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.11.4. Proxying Characteristics of PPTP</h3>





It would theoretically be possible to proxy PPTP, as long as you
could find a proxy system that supported GRE. It's not clear
that there's any point in proxying a tunneling protocol,
however. A proxy system can't apply much security, since all of
the traffic is encrypted. The only thing a proxy system could protect
you from is attacks on the PPTP server over the negotiation protocol.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.11.5. Network Address Translation Characteristics of PPTP</h3>





In general, network address translation won't interfere with
PPTP; although there are embedded addresses, they're intended
to pass through a tunnel in any case. You will require a network
address translation system that supports GRE, as well as TCP and UDP.
Network address translation will not conceal any information when
used with PPTP, and will not allow you to use PPTP between two
networks that are using the same address space, because the original
address information will be visible once the PPTP encapsulation is
removed.</p><p>

securing the information they're carrying.</p><p></li><li>If you are going to use PPTP, proxying does not give you any
significant protection, and you might as well simply pass it through
packet filters.</p><p></li><li>Configure PPTP clients and servers to use the highest available level
