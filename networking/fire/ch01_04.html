<h2 class="sect1">1.4. How Can You Protect Your Site?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-46" />What approaches can you take to protect
against the kinds of attacks we've outlined in this chapter?
People choose a variety of security models, or approaches, ranging
from no security at all, through what's called "security
through obscurity" and host security, to network security.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-449" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.1. No Security</h3>





The simplest possible approach is to put no effort at all into
security, and run with whatever minimal security your vendor provides
you by default. If you're reading this book, you've
probably already rejected this model.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-452" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.2. Security Through Obscurity</h3>





<a name="INDEX-47" />Another
possible security model is the one commonly referred to as
<em class="emphasis">security through obscurity.</em> With this model, a
system is presumed to be secure simply because (supposedly) nobody
knows about it  --  its existence, contents, security measures, or
anything else. This approach seldom works for long; there are just
too many ways to find an attractive target. One of the authors had a
system that had been connected to the Internet for only about an hour
before someone attempted to break in. Luckily, the operating system
that was in the process of being installed detected, denied, and
logged the access attempts.</p><p>





any people assume that even though attackers can find them, the
attackers won't bother to. They figure that a small company or
a home machine just isn't going to be of interest to intruders.
In fact, many intruders aren't aiming at particular targets;
they just want to break into as many machines as possible. To them,
small companies and home machines simply look like easy targets. They
probably won't stay long, but they will attempt to break in,
and they may do considerable damage. They may also use compromised
machines as platforms to attack other sites.</p><p>





To function on any network, the Internet included, a site has to do
at least a minimal amount of registration, and much of this
registration information is available to anyone, just for the asking.
Every time a site uses services on the network, someone  --  at
the very least, whoever is providing the service  --  will know
they're there. Intruders watch for new connections, in the hope
that these sites won't yet have security measures in place.
Some sites have reported automated probes apparently based on new
site registrations.</p><p>





You'd probably be amazed at how many different ways someone can
determine security-sensitive information about your site. For
example, knowing what hardware and software you have and what version
of the operating system you're running gives intruders
important clues about what security holes they might try. They can
often get this information from your host registration, or by trying
to connect to your computer. Many computers disclose their type of
operating system in the greeting you get before you log in, so an
intruder doesn't need access to get it.</p><p>





In addition, you send out all sorts of information when you deal with
other sites on the Internet. Whenever you visit a web site, you tell
that site what kind of browser you are running, and often what kind
of machine you are using. Some email programs include this
information in every piece of mail you send out.</p><p>





Even if you manage to suppress all of these visible sources of
information, intruders have scripts and programs that let them use
much subtler clues. Although the Internet operates according to
standards, there are always loopholes, or questionable situations.
Different computers do different things when presented with
exceptional situations, and intruders can figure out a lot by
creating these situations and seeing what happens. Sometimes
it's possible to figure out what kind of machine you're
dealing with just by watching the sizes and timings it uses to send
out data packets!</p><p>





If all of that fails, intruders have a lot of time on their hands,
and can often avoid having to figure out obscure facts by simply
trying all the possibilities. In the long run, relying on obscurity
is not a smart security choice.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-465" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.3. Host Security</h3>





<a name="INDEX-48" /><a name="INDEX-49" />Probably the most common model for computer
security is <em class="emphasis">host security.</em> With this model, you
enforce the security of each host machine separately, and you make
every effort to avoid or alleviate all the known security problems
that might affect that particular host. What's wrong with host
security? It's not that it doesn't work on individual
machines; it's that it doesn't scale to large numbers of
machines.</p><p>





The major impediment to effective host security in modern computing
environments is the complexity and diversity of those environments.
ost modern environments include machines from multiple vendors, each
with its own operating system, and each with its own set of security
problems. Even if the site has machines from only one vendor,
different releases of the same operating system often have
significantly different security problems. Even if all these machines
are from a single vendor and run a single release of the operating
system, different configurations (different services enabled, and so
on) can bring different subsystems into play (and into conflict) and
lead to different sets of security problems. And, even if the
machines are all absolutely identical, the sheer number of them at
some sites can make securing them all difficult. It takes a
significant amount of up-front and ongoing work to effectively
implement and maintain host security. Even with all that work done
correctly, host security still often fails due to bugs in vendor
software, or due to a lack of suitably secure software for some
required functions.</p><p>





Host security also relies on the good intentions and the skill of
everyone who has privileged access to any machine. As the number of
machines increases, the number of privileged users generally
increases as well. Securing a machine is much more difficult than
attaching it to a network, so insecure machines may appear on your
network as unexpected surprises. The mere fact that it is not
supposed to be possible to buy or connect machines without consulting
you is immaterial; people develop truly innovative purchasing and
network-connection schemes if they feel the need.</p><p>





A host security model may be highly appropriate for small sites, or
sites with extreme security requirements. Indeed, all sites should
include some level of host security in their overall security plans.
Even if you adopt a network security model, as we describe in the
next section, certain systems in your configuration will benefit from
the strongest host security. For example, even if you have built a
firewall around your internal network and systems, certain systems
exposed to the outside world will need host security. (We discuss
this in detail in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>.) The problem is, the
host security model alone just isn't cost-effective for any but
small or simple sites; making it work requires too many restrictions
and too many people.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-478" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.4. Network Security</h3>





<a name="INDEX-50" />As environments grow larger and more
diverse, and as securing them on a host-by-host basis grows more
difficult, more sites are turning to a <em class="emphasis">network
security</em> model. With a network security model, you
concentrate on controlling network access to your various hosts and
the services they offer, rather than on securing them one by one.
Network security approaches include building firewalls to protect
your internal systems and networks, using strong authentication
approaches (such as one-time passwords), and using encryption to
protect particularly sensitive data as it transits the network.</p><p>





A site can get tremendous leverage from its security efforts by using
a network security model. For example, a single network firewall of
the type we discuss in this book can protect hundreds, thousands, or
even tens of thousands of machines against attack from networks
beyond the firewall, regardless of the level of host security of the
individual machines.</p><p>





This kind of leverage depends on the ability to control the access
points to the network. At sites that are very large or very
distributed, it may be impossible for one group of people to even
identify all of those access points, much less control them. At that
point, the network security model is no longer sufficient, and
it's necessary to use layered security, combining a variety of
different security approaches.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-3-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
Although this book concentrates on network security, please note that
we aren't suggesting you ignore host security. As mentioned
previously, you should apply the strongest possible host security
measures to your most important machines, especially to those
machines that are directly connected to the Internet. (This is
discussed in more detail in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>.)
You'll also want to consider using host security on your
internal machines in general, to address security problems other than
attacks from the Internet.</p><p>

<a name="ch01-491" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.5. No Security Model Can Do It All</h3>





No security model can solve all your problems. No security model
 --  short of "maximum security prison"  --  can
prevent a hostile person with legitimate access from purposefully
damaging your site or taking confidential information out of it. To
get around powerful host and network security measures, a legitimate
user can simply use physical methods. These may range from pouring
soda into your computers to carrying sensitive memos home. You can
protect yourself from accidents and ignorance internally, and from
malicious external acts, but you cannot protect yourself from your
legitimate users without severely damaging their ability to use their
computers. Spies succeed in breaching government security with
depressing regularity despite regulations and precautions well beyond
the resources and tolerance of civilians.</p><p>





No security model can take care of management problems; computer
security will not keep your people from wasting time, annoying each
other, or embarrassing you. Sites often get sucked into trying to
make security protect against these things. When people are wasting
time surfing the Web, annoying each other by playing tricks with
window systems, and embarrassing the company with horrible email,
computer security looks like a promising technological solution that
avoids difficult issues. However tempting this may be, a security
model won't work here. It is expensive and difficult to even
try to solve these problems with computer security, and you are once
again in the impossible situation of trying to protect yourself from
legitimate users.</p><p>





No security model provides perfect protection. You can expect to make
break-ins rare, brief, and inexpensive, but you can't expect to
avoid them altogether. Even the most secure and dedicated sites
expect to have a security incident every few years.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-2" />[2]You can impress a security expert by saying you've been
broken into only once in the last five years; if you say you've
never been broken into, they stop being impressed and decide that
either you can't detect break-ins, or you haven't been
around long enough for anyone to try seriously!</p><p>




</blockquote>





Why bother, then? Security may not prevent every single incident, but
it can keep an incident from seriously damaging or even shutting down
your business. At one high-profile company with multiple computer
facilities, a manager complained that his computer facility was
supposed to be the most secure, but it got broken into along with
several others. The difference was that the break-in was the first
one that year for his facility; the intruder was present for only
eight minutes; and the computer facility was off the Internet for
only 12 hours (from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M.), after which it resumed
business as usual with no visible interruption in service to the
company's customers. For one of the other facilities, it was
the fourth time; the intruder was present for months before being
detected; recovery required taking the facility down for four days;
and they had to inform customers that they had shipped them tapes
containing possibly contaminated software. Proper security made the
difference between an annoying occurrence and a devastating
one.<a name="INDEX-51" /></p><p>
