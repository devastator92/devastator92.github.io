<h2 class="sect1">8.6. Filtering by Address</h2>





<a name="INDEX-561" /><a name="INDEX-562" />The simplest,
although not the most common, form of packet filtering is filtering
by address. Filtering in this way lets you restrict the flow of
packets based on the source and/or destination addresses of the
packets without having to consider what protocols are involved. Such
filtering can be used to allow certain external hosts to talk to
certain internal hosts, for example, or to prevent an attacker from
injecting forged packets (packets handcrafted so they appear to come
from somewhere other than their true source) into your network.</p><p>





For example, let's say that you want to block incoming packets
with forged source addresses; you would specify the following rule.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-15-fm2xml" /><table border="1">






<tr>
<th>
Rule</p><p></th>
<th>
Direction</p><p></th>
<th>
Source Address</p><p></th>
<th>
Dest. Address</p><p></th>
<th>
Action</p><p></th>
</tr>










<tr>
<td>
A</p><p></td>
<td>
Inbound</p><p></td>
<td>
Internal</p><p></td>
<td>
Any</p><p></td>
<td>
Deny</p><p></td>
</tr>





</table><p>

Note that Direction is relative to your internal network. In the
router between your internal network and the Internet, you could
apply an inbound rule either to incoming packets on the Internet
interface or to outgoing packets on the internal interface; either
way, you will achieve the same results for the protected hosts. The
difference is in what the router itself sees. If you filter outgoing
packets, the router is not protecting itself.</p><p>





<a name="ch08-5294" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.6.1. Risks of Filtering by Source Address</h3>





<a name="INDEX-563" />It's not necessarily safe to trust
source addresses because source addresses can be forged. Unless you
use some kind of cryptographic authentication between you and the
host you want to talk to, you won't know if you're really
talking to that host, or to some other machine that is pretending to
be that host. The filters we've discussed previously will help
you if an external host is claiming to be an internal host, but they
won't do anything about an external host claiming to be a
different external host.</p><p>





There are two kinds of attacks that rely on forgery: source address
and man in the middle.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-564" /><a name="INDEX-565" />In a basic <em class="emphasis">source
address</em> forgery attack (shown earlier in <a href="ch08_01.html#ch08-67845">Figure 8-1</a>), an attacker sends you packets that claim to
be from someone you trust in some way, hoping to get you to take some
action based on that trust, without expecting to get any packets back
from you. If the attacker doesn't care about getting packets
back from you, it doesn't matter where the attacker is. In
fact, your responses will go to whomever the attacker is pretending
to be, not to the attacker. However, if the attacker can predict your
responses, it doesn't matter that they're going somewhere
else. Many (if not most) protocols are predictable enough for a
skilled attacker to be successful at this. Plenty of attacks can be
carried out without the attacker's needing to see the results
directly. For example, suppose an attacker issues a command to your
system that causes it to mail back your password file; if your system
is going to send the attacker the password file in the mail, there is
no need to see it during the attack itself.</p><p>





In many circumstances  --  particularly those involving TCP
connections  --  the real machine (that the attacker is pretending
to be) will react to your packets (packets that are attempting to
carry on a conversation it knows nothing about) by trying to reset
the bogus connection. Obviously, the attacker doesn't want this
to happen. Therefore, the attack must complete before the real
machine gets the packets you're sending, or before you get the
reset packets from the real machine. There are a number of ways to
ensure this  --  for example:</p><p>





<ul><li>Carrying out the attack while the real machine is down</p><p></li><li>Crashing the real machine so the attack can be carried out</p></li><li><p>Flooding the real machine while the attack is carried out</p></li><li><p>Confusing the routing between the real machine and the target</p></li><li><p>Using an attack where only the first response packet is required, so
that the reset doesn't matter</p><p></li></ul>
Attacks of this kind used to be considered a theoretical problem with
little real-world effect, but they are now common enough to be
considered a serious threat.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-17">[17]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-17" />[17]In general, it's
not a good idea to dismiss theoretical attacks completely because
they eventually become actual attacks. This kind of attack was known
as a theoretical possibility for many years before it actually
occurred, yet many people didn't bother to protect against it.</p><p>




</blockquote>





<a name="INDEX-566" /><a name="INDEX-567" />The
<em class="emphasis">man in the middle</em> forgery attack depends on
being able to carry out a complete conversation while claiming to be
the trusted host. In order to do this, the attacking machine needs to
be able to not only send you packets, but also intercept the packets
you reply with. To do this, the attacker needs to do one of the
following:<a name="INDEX-568" /></p><p>





<ul><li>Insinuate the attacking machine into the path between you and the
real machine. This is easiest to do near the ends of the path, and
most difficult to do somewhere in the middle, because given the
nature of modern IP networks, the path through "the
middle" can change at any second.</p><p></li><li>Alter the path between the machines so it leads through the attacking
machine. This may be very easy or very difficult, depending on the
network topology and routing system used by your network, the remote
network, and the Internet service providers between those networks.</p><p></li></ul>
Although this kind of attack is called "man in the
middle", it's relatively rare for it to actually be
carried out in the middle (external to the sites at each end) because
nobody but a network provider is in a position to carry it out in
that way, and network providers are rarely compromised to that
extent. (People who compromise network providers tend to be working
on quantity. Packet sniffing will give them many hosts rapidly, but
man in the middle attacks give them only one site at a time.) These
attacks tend to be problems only if one of the involved sites has
hostile users who have physical access to the network (for example,
this might be the case if one site is a university).</p><p>





So, who <em class="emphasis">can</em> you trust? At the extreme, nobody,
unless you trust the machines involved at both ends and the path
between them. If you trust the machines but not the path, you can use
encryption and integrity protection to give you a secure connection
over an insecure path.<a name="INDEX-569" /> <a name="INDEX-570" /><a name="INDEX-571" /><a name="INDEX-572" /></p><p>
