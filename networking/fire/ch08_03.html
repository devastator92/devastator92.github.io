<h2 class="sect1">8.3. What Does the Router Do with Packets?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-526" /><a name="INDEX-527" /><a name="INDEX-528" />Once a packet filtering router has
finished examining a specific packet, what can it do with that
packet? There are two choices:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Pass the packet on</i></dt>
<dd>Normally, if the packet passes the criteria in the packet filtering
configuration, the router will forward the packet on towards its
destination, just as a normal router (not a packet filtering router)
would do.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Drop the packet</i></dt>
<dd>The other obvious action to take is to drop the packet if it fails
the criteria in the packet filtering configuration.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<a name="ch08-5053" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.1. Logging Actions</h3>





<a name="INDEX-529" /><a name="INDEX-530" />Regardless
of whether the packet is forwarded or dropped
("permitted" or "denied" in some packet
filtering implementations), you might want the router to log the
action that has been taken. This is especially true if you drop the
packet because it runs afoul of your packet filtering rules. In this
case, you'd like to know what's being tried that
isn't allowed.</p><p>





You probably aren't going to log every packet that is allowed,
but you might want to log some of these packets. For example, you
might want to log start-of-connection TCP packets, so that you can
keep track of incoming and outgoing TCP connections. Not all packet
filters will log allowed packets.</p><p>





Different packet filtering implementations support different forms of
logging. Some will log only specific information about a packet, and
others will forward or log an entire dropped packet. Generally, your
packet filter will need to be configured to log to a host somewhere
via the <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> service. You don't want the
only copy of the logs to be on the packet filter if it is
compromised. Most packet filtering also occurs on dedicated routers,
which rarely have large amounts of disk space to dedicate to logging.
See the discussion of setting up logging in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, and <a href="ch26_01.html">Chapter 26, "Maintaining Firewalls"</a>.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.3.2. Returning Error Codes</h3>





<a name="INDEX-531" /><a name="INDEX-532" /><a name="INDEX-533" /><a name="INDEX-534" /><a name="INDEX-535" /><a name="INDEX-536" />When a packet
is dropped, the router can send back an ICMP error code indicating
what happened (in this case, many packages will refer to the packet
as having been "rejected" instead of merely dropped).
Sending back an ICMP error code has the effect of warning the sending
machine not to retry sending the packet, thereby saving some network
traffic and some time for the user on the remote side. (If you send
back an ICMP error code, the user's connection attempt will
fail immediately; otherwise, it will time out, which may take several
minutes.)</p><p>





There are two sets of relevant ICMP codes to choose from:</p><p>





<ul><li>The generic "destination unreachable" codes  --  in
particular, the "host unreachable" and "network
unreachable" codes.</p><p></li><li>The "destination administratively unreachable" codes
 --  in particular, the "host administratively
unreachable" and "network administratively
unreachable" codes.</p><p></li></ul>
The first pair of ICMP error codes that the router might return,
"host unreachable" and "network unreachable",
were designed to indicate serious network problems: the destination
host is down or something in the only path to the host is down. These
error codes predate firewalls and packet filtering. The problem with
returning one of these error codes is that some hosts (particularly
if they're running older versions of Unix) take them quite
literally. If these machines get back a "host
unreachable" for a given host, they will assume that the host
is totally unreachable and will close all currently open connections
to it, even if the other connections were working perfectly well.</p><p>





The second set of ICMP error codes the router might return,
"host administratively unreachable" and "network
administratively unreachable", were added to the official list
of ICMP message types later, specifically to give packet filtering
systems something to return when they dropped a packet. Even though
they're in the standard, they're not implemented
everywhere. Theoretically, this is not a problem; the RFCs specify
that a host that gets an ICMP code it doesn't understand should
simply ignore the packet. In practice, not all systems will handle
this gracefully. The best the standard can do for you is ensure that
it is officially not your fault if somebody else's system
crashes when you send it an ICMP packet it doesn't understand.</p><p>





There are several issues to consider when you are deciding whether or
not your packet filtering system should return ICMP error codes:</p><p>





<ul><li>Which message should you send?</p><p></li><li>Can you afford the overhead of generating and returning error codes?</p></li><li><p>Will returning these codes enable attackers to get too much
information about your packet filtering?</p><p></li></ul>
Which set of error codes makes sense for your site? Returning the old
"host unreachable" and "network unreachable"
codes is technically incorrect (remember that the host may or may not
be unreachable, according to the packet filtering policy, depending
on what host is attempting to access what service). Also, these error
codes can cause many systems to react excessively (shutting down all
connections to that host or network).</p><p>





Returning the new "host administratively unreachable" or
"network administratively unreachable" codes advertises
the fact that there is a packet filtering system at your site, which
you may or may not want to do. These codes may also cause excessive
reactions in faulty IP implementations.</p><p>





There is another consideration as well. Generating and returning ICMP
error codes takes a certain small amount of effort on the part of the
packet filtering router. An attacker could conceivably mount a denial
of service attack by flooding the router with packets the router
would reject and for which it would try to generate ICMP error
packets. The issue isn't network bandwidth; it's CPU load
on the router. (While it's busy generating ICMP packets,
it's not able to do other things as quickly, like make
filtering decisions.) On the other hand, not returning ICMP error
codes will cause a small amount of excess network traffic, as the
sending system tries and retries to send the packet being dropped.
This traffic shouldn't amount to much, because the number of
packets blocked by a packet filtering system should be a fraction of
the total number of packets processed. (If it's not a small
fraction, you've got more serious problems because people are
apparently trying lots of things that "aren't
allowed".)</p><p>





If your router returns an ICMP error code for every packet that
violates your filtering policy, you're also giving an attacker
a way to probe your filtering system. By observing which packets
evoke an ICMP error response, attackers can discover what types of
packets do and don't violate your policy (and thus what types
of packets are and are not allowed into your network). You should not
give this information away because it greatly simplifies the
attacker's job. The attacker knows that packets that
don't get the ICMP error are going somewhere and can
concentrate on those protocols where you actually have
vulnerabilities. You'd rather that the attacker spent plenty of
time sending you packets that you happily throw away. Returning ICMP
error codes speeds up attack programs; if they get back an ICMP error
for something they try, they don't have to wait for a timeout.</p><p>





All in all, the safest thing to do seems to be to drop packets
without returning any ICMP error codes. If your router offers enough
flexibility, it might make sense to configure it to return ICMP error
codes to internal systems (which would like to know immediately that
something is going to fail, rather than wait for a timeout) but not
to external systems (where the information would give an attacker a
means to probe the filtering configuration of the firewall). Even if
your router doesn't seem to offer such flexibility, you may be
able to accomplish the same result by specifying packet filtering
rules to allow the relevant inbound ICMP packets and disallow the
relevant outbound ICMP packets.<a name="INDEX-537" /><a name="INDEX-538" /><a name="INDEX-539" /><a name="INDEX-540" /><a name="INDEX-541" /></p><p>





Some packet filtering systems also allow you to shut off TCP
connections without using ICMP, by responding with a TCP reset, which
aborts the connection. This is the response that a machine would
normally give if it received a TCP packet bound for a port where
nothing was listening. Although TCP resets give away less information
than ICMP error codes, they still speed up attack programs.</p><p>





There is one case where you do not usually want to drop packets
without an error. A number of systems use the authorization service
implemented by <em class="emphasis">identd</em> to attempt to do user
authentication on incoming connections (usually on mail and IRC
connections). If you are not running <em class="emphasis">identd</em> or
another server that provides information via the Auth protocol, it is
advisable to return errors on these attempts, in
order to speed up mail delivery to systems using this kind of
authorization. If you drop packets without errors, the other system
will have to wait for its request to time out before continuing the
process of accepting the mail. This can significantly increase the
load on your mail system if you need to deliver large amounts of
mail. Auth and <em class="emphasis">identd</em> are discussed further in
<a href="ch21_01.html#ch21-20321">Section 21.1, "What Is Authentication?"</a>.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.3.3. Making Changes</h3>





ore complicated packet filtering systems may take more complicated
actions. In addition to deciding whether or not to forward the
packet, they can decide to forward the packet to something other than
its original destination, to change states, or to change the contents
of the packet itself.</p><p>





A packet filter can change the destination of the packet either by
changing the destination information in the packet (for instance, as
part of network address translation or load balancing between
servers), or by encapsulating the packet inside another one (this
allows a packet filtering router to cooperate with another machine to
provide transparent proxying).</p><p>





When a stateful packet filter gets a packet, it decides not only
whether to forward or drop the packet, but also whether to modify its
state based on the packet. For instance, if the packet is an outbound
UDP packet, the packet filter may change state to allow inbound
packets that appear to be replies. If the packet is the first packet
in a TCP connection (it has the SYN bit set but no ACK, see <a href="ch04_01.html#ch04-4256">Section 4.1, "What Does a Packet Look Like?"</a>, for more details), the packet filter may
change state to expect a packet with both the SYN bit and the ACK bit
set. When it gets that second packet, it will then change state to
expect packets with the ACK bit but not the SYN bit set. This
enforces a correct TCP handshake, getting rid of some attacks
involving interesting settings of header bits.</p><p>





Some packet filtering systems will also modify parts of packets
besides the destination. This is the basis of packet filtering
systems that provide network address translation; they need to modify
not only destination information, but also source information and
sometimes embedded IP addresses further into the packet.<a name="INDEX-542" /></p><p>
