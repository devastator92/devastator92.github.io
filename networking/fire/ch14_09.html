<h2 class="sect1">14.9. IPsec</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1343" /> <a name="INDEX-1344" />The IETF has been developing an
IP security protocol (IPsec) that is built directly on top of IP and
provides end-to-end cryptographically based security for both IPv4
and IPv6. IPsec is a requirement for every IPv6 implementation and is
an option for IPv4. Since IPv6 provides features that are not
available in IPv4, the IPv6 and IPv4 versions of IPsec are
implemented slightly differently. Although IPsec is still being
standardized, it is sufficiently stable and standard that multiple
interoperable implementations are now available and in use on IPv4.
Possibly the best known of these is the IPsec implementation for
Linux called FreeS/WAN.</p><p>





Because IPsec is implemented at the IP layer, it can provide
protection to any IP protocol including TCP and UDP. The security
services that IPsec provides are:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Access control</i></dt>
<dd>The ability to establish an IPsec communication is controlled by a
policy -- refusal to negotiate security parameters will prevent
communication.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Data origin authentication</i></dt>
<dd>The recipient of a packet can be sure that it comes from the sender
it appears to come from.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Message integrity</i></dt>
<dd>An attacker cannot modify a packet and have it accepted.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Replay protection</i></dt>
<dd>An attacker cannot resend a previously sent packet and have it
accepted.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Confidentiality</i></dt>
<dd>An attacker cannot read intercepted data.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





In addition, it provides limited protections against traffic flow
analysis. In some cases, it will keep an attacker from figuring out
which hosts are exchanging data and what protocols they are using.</p><p>





IPsec is made up of three protocols, each of which is defined as a
framework that defines packet layouts and field sizes and is suitable
for use by multiple cryptographic algorithms. The protocols
themselves do not define specific cryptographic algorithms to use,
although every implementation is required to support a specified set
of algorithms. The protocols that make up IPsec are:</p><p>





<ul><li>The Authentication Header (AH)</p><p></li><li>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)</p></li><li><p>The Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)</p></li></ul>
The Authentication Header (AH) protocol provides message integrity
and data origin authentication; it can optionally provide anti-replay
services as well. The integrity protection that AH provides covers
packet header information including source and destination addresses,
but there are exceptions for header parameters that are frequently
changed by routers, such as the IPv4 TTL or IPv6 hop-count.</p><p>





The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol provides
confidentiality (encryption) and limited protection against traffic
flow analysis. ESP also includes some of the services normally
provided by AH. Both AH and ESP rely on the availability of shared
keys, and neither one has a way to move them from one machine to
another. Generating these keys is handled by the third IPsec
protocol, the ISAKMP.</p><p>





ISAKMP is also a framework protocol; it doesn't by itself
define the algorithms that are used to generate the keys for AH and
ESP. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol uses the ISAKMP
framework with specific key exchange algorithms to set up
cryptographic keys for AH and ESP. This layering may seem confusing
and overly complicated, but the separation of ISAKMP from IKE means
that the same basic IPsec framework can be used with multiple
different key exchange algorithms (including plain old manual key
exchange). The standardization of IKE allows different people to
implement the same key exchange algorithms and be guaranteed
interoperability. The Linux FreeS/WAN project has an implementation
of IKE called Pluto.</p><p>





In IPv6 the AH and ESP protocols can be used simultaneously, with an
IPv6 feature called <em class="emphasis">header chaining</em>, to provide
authentication modes that ESP alone cannot provide. When they are
used in this way it is recommended that ESP be wrapped by the
additional AH header. In IPv4, it's not possible to use them
both at once (you can have only one header at a time).</p><p>





IPsec provides two operating modes for AH and ESP, transport and
tunnel. In transport mode, AH or ESP occur immediately after the IP
header and encapsulate the remainder of the original IP packet.
<em class="emphasis">Transport mode</em> works only between individual
hosts; the packet must be interpreted by the host that receives it.
Transport is used to protect host-to-host communications. Hosts can
use it to protect all of their traffic to other cooperating hosts, or
they can use it much the way TLS is used, as a protection layer
around specific protocols.</p><p>





In <em class="emphasis">tunnel mode</em>, the entire original packet is
encapsulated in a new packet, and a new IP header is generated. IPsec
uses the term <em class="emphasis">security gateway</em> for any device
that can operate in tunnel mode. This term applies to all devices
that can take IP packets and convert them to and from the IPsec
protocols, whether they are hosts or dedicated routers. Because the
whole IP packet is included, the recipient can forward packets to a
final destination after processing. Tunnel mode is used when two
security gateways or a gateway and a host communicate, and it is what
allows you to build a virtual private network using IPsec.</p><p>





The AH and ESP protocols each contain a 32-bit value that is called
the Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is an identifier that is
used to distinguish between different conversations going to the same
destination. Every IPsec implementation is required to be able to
independently track security parameters for the combination of SPI,
destination IP address, and the security protocol that is being used
(either AH or ESP). This combination of parameters is called a
Security Association (SA). It is the responsibility of the specific
ISAKMP key management protocol to negotiate and set the cryptographic
parameters, including the SPI, for each Security Association.</p><p>





An SA is effectively the collection of the cryptographic keys and
parameters for use by either AH or ESP:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>AH</i></dt>
<dd>The cryptographic keys and algorithm identifiers used for integrity
protection and anti-replay parameters</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>ESP</i></dt>
<dd>The cryptographic keys and algorithm identifiers used for encryption,
integrity protection, and anti-replay parameters</p><p></dd>

</dl>

<h3 class="sect2">14.9.1. Packet Filtering Characteristics of IPsec</h3>





The AH and ESP protocols are implemented directly on top of the IP
layer. AH is IP protocol 51, and ESP is IP protocol 50. The ISAKMP
protocol uses UDP port 500 for both sending and receiving. In order
to allow IPsec, you will need a packet filtering system that can
filter on IP protocol type. Because IPsec provides end-to-end
protections, a firewall will not be able to modify or even be able to
inspect the contents of IPsec packets.</p><p>

You may note that the table does not include information about the
setting for the ACK bit. UDP has no equivalent of the TCP ACK bit.
When TCP packets are incorporated into AH packets, their flags will
still be present; it would be theoretically possible for a firewall
that understood AH to use those ACK bits to determine the direction
of the TCP connections and to filter using this information.
Similarly, TCP and UDP packets in AH will have their original source
and destination ports available for filtering.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.9.2. Proxying Characteristics of IPsec</h3>





AH and ESP provide end-to-end message integrity protection that is
calculated using data from the IP packet header. Using a proxy will
change the header data, thereby causing a message integrity failure.
In theory, it is possible for the IPsec architecture to allow the use
of intermediary proxies in end-to-end communications if they can
participate in the negotiation of integrity protection Security
Association parameters. Unfortunately, the details for how this might
work have not been defined so it is not currently possible to use
IPsec through proxies.</p><p>





It is, however, possible to use regular IP to the proxy system and
have it speak IPsec to the destination. In addition, IPsec could be
used with SOCKS. In this configuration, the client would set up
communications with the SOCKS server via IPsec, and the SOCKS server
would set up a separate IPsec communications channel to the final
destination. However, this double use of IPsec may require
significant CPU resources to implement.</p><p>

<a name="ch14-38-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.9.3. Network Address Translation Characteristics of IPsec</h3>





Both AH and ESP include message integrity protections for the entire
packet, including the headers. If you modify the packet at all, even
to change the source or destination address, you will make the packet
invalid. It is therefore impossible to do network address translation
with AH or ESP. On the other hand, it's perfectly possible to
do network address translation on packets that are then tunneled in
AH or ESP; they don't care what happened to the packet while it
was still a standard IP packet.</p><p>





Therefore, you can combine network address translation and IPsec
tunneling, as long as you do the network address translation first
and then set up the IPsec tunnel. (Using IPsec parlance, it would be
possible to implement network address translation behind or on a
security gateway.)</p><p>
