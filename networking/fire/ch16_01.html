<a name="INDEX-1493" /></a>From a
user's point of view, electronic mail is one of the most
crucial Internet services. Mail, along with news, provides a way for
people to hold discussions with other people, singly or in groups.
This chapter discusses the security issues related to electronic mail
and news protocols, including SMTP, POP, IMAP, MIME, and NNTP.</p><p>




<div class="sect1"><a name="ch16-26442" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">16.1. Electronic Mail</h2>





Traditionally, a mail system has three parts, which may be
implemented by different programs or by the same program, in any
combination:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>Mail transfer agent (MTA)</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1494" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1495" /></a>Accepts mail from external hosts or sends
it to external hosts</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Mail delivery agent (MDA)</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1496" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1497" /></a>Puts the mail in the correct mailbox on
the local host</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Mail user agent (MUA)</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1498" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1499" /></a>Lets
the recipient read the mail and compose outgoing mail</p><p></dd>

</dl>





<a href="ch16_01.html#ch16-61041">Figure 16-1</a> shows a large mail system and its parts.</p><p>





<a name="ch16-61041" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="243" alt="Figure 16-1" src="figs/fire2.1601.gif" width="293" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-1. The parts of a mail system</h4>

Each of these parts is vulnerable for a different reason:</p><p>





<ul><li>The transfer agent directly accepts commands (related to transporting
mail) from external hosts; for this reason, if the transfer agent
isn't secure, it may end up immediately giving an attacker all
the access it has itself.</p><p></li><li>The delivery agent needs special permissions because it needs to be
able to write into every user's mailbox. Although the delivery
agent doesn't need to talk to the external world, if it can be
subverted somehow, the intruder obtains very broad access.</p><p></li><li>The user agent runs as one user, and it doesn't talk to the
external world, which limits its power and accessibility; however, it
can often run arbitrary other programs in response to the data
received.</p><p></li></ul>
A large modern mail system may involve more than three parts. For
instance, it is common for the user agent to be a client speaking POP
or IMAP, in which case a POP or IMAP server sits between the delivery
agent and the user agent. The delivery agent itself may involve
database transactions (and therefore a database server). The basic
vulnerabilities remain the same.</p><p>





With any service that transfers data around, there are three main
risks:</p><p>





<ul><li>Giving away data that you wanted to keep secret</p><p></li><li>Getting information that you didn't want (whether it's
illegal, virus-infected, or merely obnoxious)</p><p></li><li>Having people directly attack the parts of the server<p></p></li></ul>
The last risk is specific to the individual servers and protocols
that you use, and we will address it as we talk about particular
protocols. The first two, however, have issues that are different for
electronic mail than for other kinds of information transfer, but are
the same for all mail servers, and we will discuss them here.</p><p>





<a name="ch16-2-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.1. Keeping Mail Secret</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1500" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1501" /></a>Most protocols that transfer information
use relatively direct connections; the server and the client that
talk to each other are usually the original source and final
destination of the transfer. That's not true for mail, where
messages usually pass through multiple servers between the source and
the destination. <a href="ch16_01.html#ch16-37155">Figure 16-2</a> shows a typical mail
path.</p><p>





<a name="ch16-37155" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="309" alt="Figure 16-2" src="figs/fire2.1602.gif" width="470" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-2. A typical path for a mail message </h4>

<a name="INDEX-1502" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1503" /></a>In this situation, protocols that make
encrypted connections between a client and a server don't do
much good. There are some cases where encryption helps; if you know
what route mail follows, and only one part of it is unprotected, and
you control the clients and servers on both ends of that link, you
can encrypt just that link. For instance, if you are trying to
protect internal mail that's being read by a user on the
Internet, it's just the last link between the user and your
mail server that you're worried about, and you can protect it.
If you're trying to securely transfer mail between your company
and a subsidiary, you can set up the mail systems so that you know
mail goes directly between their server and yours and encrypt that
connection. As usual, you can use either an encrypted protocol (ESMTP
with STARTTLS or Secure POP, for instance; both of them are discussed
later in this chapter) or a virtual private network to protect the
connection.</p><p>





If you're trying to protect mail in a situation where you
don't control the servers, the clients, and the mail routing
between them, this sort of encryption isn't going to do you any
good. You can't guarantee that all the servers involved will
use it. You can't even guarantee that you'll be able to
authenticate the servers that you need to exchange mail with (you
might want to exchange mail with any server on the Internet, and
there is currently no infrastructure that allows you to authenticate
arbitrary servers).</p><p>





When you're trying to pass information along a path you
don't control, you have to encrypt the message data, instead of
using encrypted links. There are a number of systems for doing this;
many mail user agents offer encryption features. Most systems require
that the sender and the receiver have compatible software, and that
they have some way to exchange keys outside of electronic mail. The
systems that best address these problems are S/MIME and OpenPGP,
discussed later, which are implemented by a number of different user
agents and use public key cryptography.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1504" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1505" /></a>People occasionally advocate the
use of self-decrypting archives. To make a self-decrypting archive,
you take the file you want to encrypt and use a program that embeds
your file into another program. You mail this new program to your
correspondent; when it is run, it asks for a password, and if the
password is correct, it produces the original file. This removes the
need for the recipient to have the decryption program (although not
the need for a way to safely communicate the key). Unfortunately, it
requires the recipient to have a computer that can run the executable
and to be willing to run an unknown executable received in
unauthenticated electronic mail. As we discuss later, people should
not run executables they get in electronic mail. In addition, it is
quite difficult to produce a secure program that will make
self-decrypting archives of a reasonable size. Since most security
experts are unwilling to have anything to do with self-decrypting
archives, finding it unethical to encourage people to associate
security with running random unauthenticated executables, it's
reasonable to assume that self-decrypting archives are not just a bad
idea; they're also insecure. <a name="INDEX-1506" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1507" /></a></p><p>

<a name="ch16-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.2. Undesirable Mail</h3>





There are two main kinds of undesirable mail: mail that's
merely annoying and mail that's actively hostile.</p><p>





<a name="ch16-4-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.1.2.1. Junk mail</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1508" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1509" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1510" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1511" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1512" /></a>These days, the most frequent problems
with mail servers has to do with something called by a number of
names, including the serious "Unsolicited Commercial
Email" (UCE) and the frivolous "spam" (which is not
a computer-originated acronym, but a reference to a Monty Python skit
in which the Hormel meat-product SPAM is undesirable but
unavoidable). By any name, this is junk email --  advertisements
flooding in electronically. This phenomenon arouses great hostility,
as well as putting substantial load on the network, so people who
create it tend to spread out both the load and the repercussions by
routing it through third parties.</p><p>





Thus, if you run an Internet-attached mail server, you have three
concerns about this kind of mail:</p><p>





<ul><li>Preventing outsiders from using your mail server to annoy third
parties</p><p></li><li>Preventing people from annoying your users<p></p></li><li>Preventing your users from annoying other people<p></p></li></ul>
A variety of techniques are used to achieve these goals. We
can't discuss all of them here, as it's a complex and
implementation-dependent topic, which fills entire books (for
instance, <em class="emphasis">Stopping Spam</em> by Alan Schwartz and
Simson Garfinkel, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1998<em class="emphasis">,
</em>which you might want to consult).</p><p>





Note that these three goals, while they're related, require
quite different approaches. When you're evaluating mail
servers, you need to pay attention to exactly what sort of
protections they offer you; many "anti-spam" features are
actually anti-relaying features, designed to prevent outsiders from
using your mail server to relay mail to other people. These are
useful and important features to have, but they won't be of any
immediate use in emptying your mailbox of advertisements for golf
balls, pictures of naked people, and completely legal ways to make a
million dollars without doing any work.
<a name="INDEX-1513" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1514" /></a><a name="INDEX-1515" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1516" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1517" /></a></p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch16-5-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.1.2.2. Viruses and other hostilities</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1518" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1519" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1520" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1521" /></a>While junk mail is annoying, some mail
goes further and actually contains attacks on your machines. This may
be because the person the mail seems to come from is trying to attack
you, but more likely, it's the fault of some third party who
has either forged the mail or tricked the mail's sender. The
most important way to control these things is to avoid any situation
where you execute code from an electronic mail message without having
good authentication (don't accept programs from strangers).
This is much more difficult than it sounds.</p><p>





It's relatively obvious if you receive an attachment
that's a normal program executable. It may not be at all
obvious to you that HTML files may contain code (in the form of Java,
JavaScript, VBScript, or ActiveX controls) or that Microsoft Word
documents can also be programs (they can contain Visual Basic macros,
which are capable of doing anything other programs can do). In
general, don't open any file unless you know exactly where it
came from, or you know exactly what the program that opens it can do
(and it can't do much). For instance, you certainly don't
want to open Microsoft Word documents with Microsoft Word, but you
might be willing to open them with the specialized Word Viewer, which
can't execute macros.</p><p>





Furthermore, you don't want to open something just because you
know who it comes from, even if you can authenticate the mail. Some
programs replicate by reading an infected user's address book
and mailing themselves to the addresses in it. They'll appear
as perfectly valid mail sent by somebody you know.</p><p>





Worse yet, you may have to specially configure your mail reader to
keep it from executing code automatically. As we discussed in <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "The World Wide Web"</a>, some mail readers that are integrated with
web browsers will run code in web extension languages even when it is
embedded in mail messages. You will want to disable this
functionality.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1522" /></a>All of this makes it
extremely difficult to control hostile mail at the client end. Years
of education have not succeeded in getting people to think twice
before forwarding chain letters, and they're not going to
succeed in the much more difficult task of training people not to
even open files to read them. It's therefore a very good idea
to do some content filtering of incoming electronic mail to remove
known hostile code. You will also need to do the training and
filtering on the client end; content filtering on the mail server
will not protect you from the many other sources of hostile code; the
server is easily deceived by encrypting or otherwise changing the
code, and it can detect only known attacks. However, it provides you
a single point of control where you can get rid of current problems
with one intervention, which can make all the difference in dealing
with crises.</p><p>





If you filter incoming mail, it is both wise and polite to filter
your outgoing mail as well. Obviously, it's polite to avoid
infecting other people, but it's also a useful way to diagnose
and get rid of internal problems; if you're sending out hostile
code, you have either infected machines or hostile users, and you
want to get rid of them before they do damage to you.</p><p>





Setting up filtering will depend on the details of your mail server
configuration. Virus filters are available for almost all mail
servers, as commercial or freely available products. In general,
virus filters are most effective when they are running on the same
platform they are trying to protect (that is, the Windows NT-based
filters are better than the Unix-based filters at protecting
icrosoft machines), but it is possible to provide basic protections
for any machine from any mail server.<a name="INDEX-1523" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1524" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1525" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1526" /></a></p><p>

<a name="ch16-8457" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.3. Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1527" /></a><a name="INDEX-1528" /></a>MIME
is a set of extensions to the basic Internet electronic mail message
format supporting things like:</p><p>





<ul><li>Non-ASCII character sets</p><p></li><li>Nontext data such as pictures and audio segments<p></p></li><li><p>So-called "rich text" messages (messages containing
formatted text, with different fonts and so on, rather than simple
single-font unformatted text)</p><p></li><li>Multipart messages (messages containing multiple pieces, each piece
in its own format)</p><p></li></ul>
IME support is mostly a client issue; to mail servers and transport
systems, a MIME message is generally just another message. The
question is whether or not a given client can generate outgoing MIME
messages, and whether or not it can recognize and cope with incoming
IME messages.</p><p>





The MIME standards define certain basic data types, such as plain
text, formatted text, standard audio, and so on. MIME is designed to
be extensible, so that new data types can be added as necessary.
IME-capable mail clients generally understand certain data types
(often only multipart messages and plain text) and rely on other
programs to handle other data types (for example, graphics programs
to display images, and sound programs to play audio clips). The
clients generally have a list of external programs to run for
particular types of data; this list can be extended or modified by
the user.</p><p>





The issues for email clients are much the same as the issues for web
browsers, which are discussed in <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "The World Wide Web"</a>. Since
you are running additional programs, you are vulnerable to security
problems in those programs as well as any security problems that may
be present in your mail client.</p><p>





One difference between MIME support in email clients and web browsers
is how data is obtained. With a web browser, the user chooses what
data to access; with email, the user accesses whatever anybody sends.
In theory, email clients are more vulnerable because you can't
control what other people send you by email. In practice, however,
the difference isn't that important because it's fairly
easy to lure web users into accessing whatever you want them to
access. Either way, you need to carefully control what data types
your clients understand and how they process that data.<a name="INDEX-1529" /></a></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch16-6-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.4. S/MIME and OpenPGP</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1530" /></a><a name="INDEX-1531" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1532" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1533" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1534" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1535" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1536" /></a>S/MIME and OpenPGP
are extensions to MIME that support encryption and digital signatures
(for indentifying the sender of a message or for protecting it from
unauthorized modifications). Both S/MIME and OpenPGP are implemented
as special MIME data types that use public key encryption to
digitally sign and encrypt messages. S/MIME can include certificate
information to help senders and receivers establish trust
relationships. OpenPGP uses a "web of trust" model, which
requires that you have independent access to certificate information.
This significantly reduces the overhead added to messages. See <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Cryptography"</a>, for more information about public key
encryption and certificates. There are several versions of S/MIME;
those prior to version 3 do not necessarily provide very strong
encryption.</p><p>





S/MIME version 3 and OpenPGP are being developed as Internet
standards, and both require the implementation of strong encryption.
Neither requires a license for using patented encryption technology
in a commercial environment. There are multiple implementations of
both S/MIME and OpenPGP; commercial products typically implement
S/MIME, and freely available software tends to implement
OpenPGP.<a name="INDEX-1537" /></a>
