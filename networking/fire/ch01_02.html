<h2 class="sect1">1.2. What Are You Trying to Protect Against?</h2>





<a name="INDEX-11" /><a name="INDEX-12" /><a name="INDEX-13" />What's out there to worry about? What
types of attacks are you likely to face on the Internet, and what
types of attackers are likely to be carrying them out? And what about
simple accidents or stupidity? In the sections that follow, we touch
on these topics, but we don't go into any technical detail;
later chapters describe different kinds of attacks in some detail and
explain how firewalls can help protect against them.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-291" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.1. Types of Attacks</h3>





There are many types of attacks on systems, and many ways of
categorizing these attacks. In this section, we break attacks down
into three basic categories: intrusion, denial of service, and
information theft.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-294" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.1. Intrusion</h3>





<a name="INDEX-14" /><a name="INDEX-15" />The
most common attacks on your systems are
<em class="emphasis">intrusions</em>; with intrusions, people are actually
able to use your computers. Most attackers want to use your computers
as if they were legitimate users.</p><p>





Attackers have dozens of ways to get access. They range from social
engineering attacks (you figure out the name of somebody high up in
the company; you call a system administrator, claiming to be that
person and claiming to need your password changed <em class="emphasis">right
now</em>, so that you can get important work done), to simple
guesswork (you try account names and password combinations until one
works), to intricate ways to get in without needing to know an
account name and a password.</p><p>





As we describe in this book, firewalls help prevent intrusions in a
number of ways. Ideally, they block all ways to get into a system
without knowing an account name and password. Properly configured,
they reduce the number of accounts accessible from the outside that
are therefore vulnerable to guesswork or social engineering. Most
people configure their firewalls to use one-time passwords that
prevent guessing attacks. Even if you don't use these
passwords, which we describe in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>, a
firewall will give you a controlled place to log attempts to get into
your system, and, in this way, they help you detect guessing attacks.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-308" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.2. Denial of service</h3>





<a name="INDEX-16" /><a name="INDEX-17" /><a name="INDEX-18" /><a name="INDEX-19" /><a name="INDEX-20" />A <em class="emphasis">denial of
service</em> attack is one that's aimed entirely at
preventing you from using your own computers.</p><p>





In late 1994, writers Josh Quittner and Michelle Slatalla were the
target of an "electronic mail bomb". Apparently in
retaliation for an article on the cracker community they'd
published in <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> magazine, someone broke into
IBM, Sprint, and the writers' network provider, and modified
programs so their email and telephone service was disrupted. A flood
of email messages so overwhelmed their network service that other
messages couldn't get through; eventually, their Internet
connection was shut down entirely. Their phone service also fell
victim to the intruders, who reprogrammed the service so that callers
were routed to an out-of-state number where they heard an obscene
recording.</p><p>





Although some cases of electronic sabotage involve the actual
destruction or shutting down of equipment or data, more often they
follow the pattern of flooding seen in the Quittner-Slatalla case or
in the case of the 1988 Morris Internet worm. An intruder so floods a
system or network  --  with messages, processes, or network
requests  --  that no real work can be done. The system or network
spends all its time responding to messages and requests, and
can't satisfy any of them.</p><p>





While flooding is the simplest and most common way to carry out a
denial of service attack, a cleverer attacker can also disable
services, reroute them, or replace them. For example, the phone
attack in the Quittner-Slatalla case denied phone service by
rerouting their phone calls elsewhere; it's possible to mount
the same kind of attack against Internet services.</p><p>





It's close to impossible to avoid all denial of service
attacks. Sometimes it's a "heads, I win; tails, you
lose" situation for attackers. For example, many sites set
accounts up to become unusable after a certain number of failed login
attempts. This prevents attackers from simply trying passwords until
they find the right one. On the other hand, it gives the attackers an
easy way to mount a denial of service attack: they can lock any
user's account simply by trying to log in a few times.</p><p>





ost often, the risk of denial of service attacks is unavoidable. If
you accept things from the external universe  --  electronic mail,
telephone calls, or packages  --  it's possible to get
flooded. The notorious college prank of ordering a pizza or two from
every pizzeria in town to be delivered to your least favorite person
is a form of denial of service; it's hard to do much else while
arguing with 42 pizza deliverers. In the electronic world, denial of
service is as likely to happen by accident as on purpose (have you
ever had a persistent fax machine try to fax something to your voice
line?). The most important thing is to set up services so that if one
of them is flooded, the rest of your site keeps functioning while you
find and fix the problem.</p><p>





Flooding attacks are considered unsporting by many attackers, because
they aren't very difficult to carry out. For most attackers,
they're also pointless, because they don't provide the attacker
with the information or the ability to use your computers (the payoff
for most other attacks). Intentional flooding attacks are usually the
work of people who are angry at your site in particular, and at most
sites such people are quite rare.</p><p>





With the right tools and cooperation, it's fairly easy to trace
flood packets back to their source, but that might not help you
figure out who is behind the attacks. The attacks almost always come
from machines that have themselves been broken into; only a really
stupid attacker generates an easily traced flood of packets from
their own machine. Sometimes flooding attacks are carried out by
remote control. Attackers install remotely controlled flooding
software on systems that they break into over the course of many
weeks or months. This software lies dormant and undiscovered until
some later time, when they trigger many of these remotely controlled
installations simultaneously to bombard their victims with massive
floods of traffic from many different directions at once. This was
the method behind the highly publicized denial of service attacks on
Yahoo!, CNN, and other high-profile Internet sites early in the year
2000.</p><p>





You are far more likely to encounter unintentional flooding problems,
as we discuss in <a href="ch01_02.html#ch01-425">Section 1.2.3, "Stupidity and Accidents"</a>, later in this chapter.
<a name="INDEX-21" />
<a name="INDEX-22" />
<a name="INDEX-23" />
</p><p>





On the other hand, some denial of service attacks are easier for
attackers, and these are relatively popular. Attacks that involve
sending small amounts of data that cause machines to reboot or hang
are very popular with the same sort of people who like to set off
fire alarms in dormitories in the middle of the night, for much the
same reason; with a small investment, you can massively annoy a very
large number of people who are unlikely to be able to find you
afterwards. The good news is that most of these attacks are
avoidable; a well-designed firewall will usually not be susceptible
to them itself, and will usually prevent them from reaching internal
machines that are vulnerable to them.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-337" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.3. Information theft</h3>





<a name="INDEX-24" /><a name="INDEX-25" /><a name="INDEX-26" />Some types of attacks allow an
attacker to get data without ever having to directly use your
computers. Usually these attacks exploit Internet services that are
intended to give out information, inducing the services to give out
more information than was intended, or to give it out to the wrong
people. Many Internet services are designed for use on local area
networks, and don't have the type or degree of security that
would allow them to be used safely across the Internet.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">Information theft</em> doesn't need to be
active or particularly technical. People who want to find out
personal information could simply call you and ask (perhaps
pretending to be somebody who had a right to know): this is an
<em class="emphasis">active</em> information theft. Or they could tap your
telephone: this is a <em class="emphasis">passive</em> information theft.
Similarly, people who want to gather electronic information could
actively query for it (perhaps pretending to be a machine or a user
with valid access) or could passively tap the network and wait for it
to flow by.</p><p>





ost people who steal information try to get access to your
computers; they're looking for usernames and passwords.
Fortunately for them, and unfortunately for everybody else,
that's the easiest kind of information to get when tapping a
network. Username and password information occurs quite predictably
at the beginning of many network interactions, and such information
can often be reused in the same form.</p><p>





How would you proceed if you want to find out how somebody answers
her telephone? Installing a tap would be an easy and reliable way to
get that information, and a tap at a central point in the telephone
system would yield the telephone greetings of hundreds or thousands
of people in a short period of time.</p><p>





On the other hand, what if you want to know how somebody spells his
or her last name, or what the names and ages of his or her children
are? In this case, a telephone tap is a slow and unreliable way to
get that information. A telephone tap at a central point in the
system will probably yield that information about some people, and it
will certainly yield some secret information you could use in
interesting ways, but the information is going to be buried among the
conversations of hundreds of people setting up lunch dates and
chatting about the weather.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-27" /><a name="INDEX-28" /><a name="INDEX-29" />
<a name="INDEX-30" /><a name="INDEX-31" />Similarly, network taps, which are usually
called <em class="emphasis">sniffers</em>, are very effective at finding
password information but are rarely used by attackers to gather other
kinds of information. Getting more specific information about a site
requires either extreme dedication and patience, or the knowledge
that the information you want will reliably pass through a given
place at a given time. For example, if you know that somebody calls
the bank to transfer money between his or her checking and savings
accounts at 2 P.M. every other Friday, it's worth tapping that
phone call to find out the person's access codes and account
numbers. However, it's probably not worth tapping somebody
else's phone, on the off chance that they too will do such a
transfer, because most people don't transfer money over the
phone at all.</p><p>





Network sniffing is much easier than tapping a telephone line.
Historically, the connectors used to hook a computer to an Ethernet
network were known as <em class="emphasis">network taps</em> (that's
why the term <em class="emphasis">tapping</em> isn't used for spying
on a network), and the connectors behave like taps too. In most
networks, computers can see traffic that is intended for other hosts.
Traffic that crosses the Internet may cross any number of local area
networks, any one of which can be a point of compromise. Network
service providers and public-access systems are very popular targets
for intrusions; sniffers placed there can be extremely successful
because so much traffic passes through these networks.</p><p>





There are several types of protection against information theft. A
properly configured firewall will protect you against people who are
trying to get more information than you intended to give. Once
you've decided to give information out across the Internet,
however, it's very difficult to protect against that
information's reaching an unintended audience, either through
misauthentication (somebody claiming to be authorized, when he or she
isn't) or through sniffing (somebody simply reading information
as it crosses a correctly authorized channel). For that matter, once
you have given the information to somebody, you have no way to
prevent that person from distributing it to other people. Although
these risks are outside of the protection a firewall can give
(because they occur once information has intentionally been allowed
to go outside your network), we do discuss them and the methods used
to reduce them, as appropriate in this book.<a name="INDEX-32" /><a name="INDEX-33" /></p><p>

<a name="ch01-375" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.2. Types of Attackers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-34" /><a name="INDEX-35" />This
section very briefly describes the types of attackers who are out
there on the Internet. There are many ways to categorize these
attackers; we can't really do justice to the many variants of
attackers we've seen over the years, and any quick summary of
this kind necessarily presents a rather stereotyped view.
Nevertheless, this summary may be useful in distinguishing the main
categories of attackers.</p><p>





All attackers share certain characteristics. They don't want to
be caught, so they try to conceal themselves, their identity and real
geographic location. If they gain access to your system, they will
certainly attempt to preserve that access, if possible, by building
in extra ways to get access (and they hope you won't notice
these access routes even if you find the attackers themselves). Most
of them have some contact with other people who have the same kinds
of interests ("the underground" is not hard to find), and
most will share the information they get from attacking your system.
A secondary group of attackers may not be as benign.</p><p>





<a name="ch01-385" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.1. Joyriders</h3>





<a name="INDEX-36" /><em class="emphasis">Joyriders
</em>are bored people looking for amusement. They break in
because they think you might have interesting data, or because it
would be amusing to use your computers, or because they have nothing
better to do. They might be out to learn about the kind of computer
you have or about the data you have. They're curious but not
actively malicious; however, they often damage the system through
ignorance or in trying to cover their tracks. Joyriders are
particularly attracted to well-known sites and uncommon computers.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-391" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.2. Vandals</h3>





<a name="INDEX-37" /><em class="emphasis">Vandals</em>
are out to do damage, either because they get their kicks from
destroying things, or because they don't like you. When one
gets to you, you'll know it.</p><p>





Vandals are a big problem if you're somebody that the Internet
underground might think of as The Enemy (for example, the phone
company or the government) or if you tend to annoy people who have
computers and time (for example, you're a university with
failing students, or a computer company with annoyed customers, or
you have an aggressively commercial presence on the Internet). You
can also become a target simply by being large and visible; if you
put a big wall up in certain neighborhoods, people will put graffiti
on it no matter how they feel about you.</p><p>





Fortunately, vandals are fairly rare. People don't like them,
even people in the underground who have nothing against breaking into
computers in general. Vandals also tend to inspire people to go to
great lengths to find them and stop them. Unlike more mundane
intruders, vandals have short but splashy careers. Most of them also
go for straightforward destruction, which is unpleasant but is
relatively easily detected and repaired. In most circumstances,
deleting your data, or even ruining your computer equipment, is not
the worst thing somebody could do to you, but it is what vandals do.
(Actually, introducing subtle but significant changes in programs or
financial data would be much harder to detect and fix.)</p><p>





Unfortunately, it's close to impossible to stop a determined
vandal; somebody with a true vendetta against your site is going to
get you, sooner or later. Certain attacks are attractive to vandals
but not to other types of attackers. For example, denial of service
attacks are not attractive to joyriders; while joyriders are around
in your system, they are just as interested as you are in having your
computers up, running, and available to the Internet.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-400" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.3. Scorekeepers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-38" />Many intruders
are engaging in an updated version of an ancient tradition.
They're gaining bragging rights, based on the number and types
of systems they've broken into.</p><p>





Like joyriders and vandals, <em class="emphasis">scorekeepers</em> may
prefer sites of particular interest. Breaking into something well
known, well defended, or otherwise especially cool is usually worth
more points to them. However, they'll also attack anything they
can get at; they're going for quantity as well as quality. They
don't have to want anything you've got or care in the
least about the characteristics of your site. They may or may not do
damage on the way through. They'll certainly gather information
and keep it for later use (perhaps using it to barter with other
attackers). They'll probably try to leave themselves ways to
get back in later. And, if at all possible, they'll use your
machines as a platform to attack others.</p><p>





These people are the ones you discover long after they've
broken in to your system. You may find out slowly, because
something's odd about your machine. Or you'll find out
when another site or a law enforcement agency calls up because your
system is being used to attack other places. Or you'll find out
when somebody sends you a copy of your own private data, which
they've found on a cracked system on the other side of the
world.</p><p>





any scorekeepers are what are known as <em class="emphasis">script
kiddies</em> -- attackers who are not themselves technically
expert but are using programs or scripts written by other people and
following instructions about how to use them. Although they do tend
to be young, they're called "kiddies" mostly out of
contempt aimed at them by more experienced intruders. Even though
these attackers are not innovators, they still pose a real threat to
sites that don't keep rigorously up to date. Information
spreads very rapidly in the underground, and the script kiddies are
extremely numerous. Once a script exists, somebody is almost
guaranteed to attack your site with it.</p><p>





These days, some scorekeepers aren't even counting machines
they've broken into but are keeping score on crashed machines.
On the one hand, having a machine crash is generally less destructive
than having it broken into; on the other hand, if a particular attack
gets into the hands of the script kiddies, and thousands of people
use it to crash your machine, it's not funny any more.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch01-408" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.4. Spies (industrial and otherwise)</h3>





<a name="INDEX-39" /><a name="INDEX-40" /><a name="INDEX-41" /><a name="INDEX-42" />Most people who break into computers do so
for the same reason people climb mountains  --  because
they're there. While these people are not above theft, they
usually steal things that are directly convertible into money or
further access (e.g., credit card, telephone, or network access
information). If they find secrets they think they can sell, they may
try to do so, but that's not their main business.</p><p>





As far as anybody knows, serious computer-based espionage is much
rarer, outside of traditional espionage circles. (That is, if
you're a professional spy, other professional spies are
probably watching you and your computers.) Espionage is much more
difficult to detect than run-of-the-mill break-ins, however.
Information theft need not leave any traces at all, and even
intrusions are relatively rarely detected immediately. Somebody who
breaks in, copies data, and leaves without disturbing anything is
quite likely to get away with it at most sites.</p><p>





In practical terms, most organizations can't prevent spies from
succeeding. The precautions that governments take to protect
sensitive information on computers are complex, expensive, and
cumbersome; therefore, they are used on only the most critical
resources. These precautions include electromagnetic shielding,
careful access controls, and absolutely no connections to unsecured
networks.</p><p>





What can you do to protect against attackers of this kind? You can
ensure that your Internet connection isn't the easiest way for
a spy to gather information. You don't want some kid to break
into your computers and find something that immediately appears to be
worth trying to sell to spies; you don't want your competitors
to be trivially able to get to your data; and you do want to make it
expensive and risky to spy on you. Some people say it's
unreasonable to protect data from network access when somebody could
get it easily by coming to your site physically. We don't
agree; physical access is generally more expensive and more risky for
an attacker than network access.</p><p>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-425" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.3. Stupidity and Accidents</h3>





<a name="INDEX-43" /><a name="INDEX-44" />Most
disasters are not caused through ill will; they're accidents or
stupid mistakes. One study estimates that 55 percent of all security
incidents actually result from naive or untrained users doing things
they shouldn't.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" />[1]Richard Power,
<em class="citetitle">Current and Future Danger: A </em><em class="emphasis">CSI
</em><em class="citetitle">Primer on Computer Crime and Information
Warfare</em> (San Francisco: Computer Security Institute,
1995).</p><p>




</blockquote>





Denial of service incidents, for example, frequently aren't
attacks at all. Apple's corporate electronic mail was rendered
nonfunctional for several days (and their network provider was
severely inconvenienced) by an accident involving a single mail
message sent from a buggy mail server to a large mailing list. The
mail resulted in a cascade of hundreds of thousands of error
messages. The only hostile person involved was the system
administrator, who wasn't hostile until he had to clean up the
resulting mess.</p><p>





Similarly, it's not uncommon for companies to destroy their own
data or release it to the world by accident. Firewalls aren't
designed to deal with this kind of problem. In fact, there is no
known way to fully protect yourself from either accidents or
stupidity. However, whether people are attacking you on purpose, or
are simply making mistakes, the results are quite similar. (Hence the
saying, "Never ascribe to malice that which can adequately be
explained by stupidity".) When you protect yourself against
evildoers, you also help protect yourself against the more common,
but equally devastating, unintentional or well-intentioned
error.<a name="INDEX-45" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch01-2-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.4. Theoretical Attacks</h3>





It's relatively easy to determine the risk involved in attacks
that are currently under way, but what do you do about attacks that
are theoretically possible but have not yet been used? It's
very tempting to dismiss them altogether -- after all, what
matters to you is not what might happen to you, but what actually
does happen to you. You don't really care if it's
possible to do something, as long as nobody ever does it. So why
should you worry if somebody produces a proof that an attack is
possible, but it's so difficult that nobody is actually doing
it?</p><p>





<ul><li>Because the limits on what's difficult change rapidly in
computing.</p><p></li><li>Because problems rarely come in isolation, and one attack
that's too difficult may help people find an easier one.</p><p></li><li>Because eventually people run out of easier attacks and turn to more
difficult ones.</p><p></li><li>And most importantly, because attacks move almost instantly from
"never attempted" to "widely used".</p><p></li></ul>
The moment at which an attack is no longer merely theoretical, but is
actually in use against your site, is that time that is technically
called "too late". You certainly don't want to wait
until then. You'll have a calmer and more peaceful life if you
don't wait until the moment when an attack hits the newspaper
headlines, either, and that's where a lot of theoretical
attacks suddenly end up.</p><p>





One computer vendor decided that a certain class of attacks, called
<em class="emphasis">stack attacks,</em> were too difficult to exploit,
and it was not worth trying to prevent them. These attacks are
technically challenging on any hardware, and more difficult on their
machines. It seemed unlikely that attackers would bother to go to the
considerable effort necessary, and preventing the attacks required
rewriting fundamental parts of the operating system. Thus, the vendor
elected to avoid doing tedious and dangerous rewriting work to
prevent what was then considered a purely theoretical risk. Six
months later, somebody found and exploited one of the
vulnerabilities; once the hard work had been done for one, the rest
were easy, so that started a landslide of exploits and bad publicity.</p><p>
