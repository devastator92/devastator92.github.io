<a name="INDEX-656" /></a>Proxying provides Internet access to a
single host, or a very small number of hosts, while appearing to
provide access to all of your hosts. The hosts that have access act
as proxies for the machines that don't, doing what these
machines want done.</p><p>





A proxy server for a particular protocol or set of protocols runs on
a dual-homed host or a bastion host: some host that the user can talk
to, which can, in turn, talk to the outside world. The user's
client program talks to this proxy server instead of directly to the
"real" server out on the Internet. The proxy server
evaluates requests from the client and decides which to pass on and
which to disregard. If a request is approved, the proxy server talks
to the real server on behalf of the client and proceeds to relay
requests from the client to the real server, and to relay the real
server's answers back to the client.</p><p>





As far as the user is concerned, talking to the proxy server is just
like talking directly to the real server. As far as the real server
is concerned, it's talking to a user on the host that is
running the proxy server; it doesn't know that the user is
really somewhere else.</p><p>





Since the proxy server is the only machine that speaks to the outside
world, it's the only machine that needs a valid IP address.
This makes proxying an easy way for sites to economize on address
space. Network address translation can also be used (by itself or in
conjunction with proxying) to achieve this end.</p><p>





Proxying doesn't require any special hardware, but something
somewhere has to make certain that the proxy server gets the
connection. This might be done on the client end by telling it to
connect to the proxy server, or it might be done by intercepting the
connection without the client's knowledge and redirecting it to
<a name="INDEX-657" /></a>
the proxy server.</p><p>





<a name="ch09-2-fm2xml" /></a><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
Proxy systems are effective only when
they are used in conjunction with some method of restricting IP-level
traffic between the clients and the real servers, such as a screening
router or a dual-homed host that doesn't route packets. If
there is IP-level connectivity between the clients and the real
servers, the clients can bypass the proxy system (and presumably so
can someone from the outside).</p><p>




</blockquote>


















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch09-7100" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">9.1. Why Proxying?</h2>





There's no point in connecting to the Internet if your users
can't access it. On the other hand, there's no safety in
connecting to the Internet if there's free access between it
and every host at your site. Some compromise has to be applied.</p><p>





The most obvious compromise is to provide a single host with Internet
access for all your users. However, this isn't a satisfactory
solution because these hosts aren't transparent to users. Users
who want to access network services can't do so directly. They
have to log in to the dual-homed host, do all their work from there,
and then somehow transfer the results of their work back to their own
workstations. At best, this multiple-step process annoys users by
forcing them to do multiple transfers and work without the
customizations they're accustomed to.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-658" /></a><a name="INDEX-659" /></a>The problem is worse at sites with
multiple operating systems; if your native system is a Macintosh, and
the dual-homed host is a Unix system, the Unix system will probably
be completely foreign to you. You'll be limited to using
whatever tools are available on the dual-homed host, and these tools
may be completely unlike (and may seem inferior to) the tools you use
on your own system.</p><p>





Dual-homed hosts configured without proxies therefore tend to annoy
their users and significantly reduce the benefit people get from the
Internet connection. Worse, they usually don't provide adequate
security; it's almost impossible to adequately secure a machine
with many users, particularly when those users are explicitly trying
to get to the external universe. You can't effectively limit
the available tools because your users can always transfer tools from
internal machines that are the same type. For example, on a
dual-homed host, you can't guarantee that all file transfers
will be logged because people can use their own file transfer agents
that don't do logging.</p><p>





Proxy systems avoid user frustration and the insecurities of a
dual-homed host. They deal with user frustration by automating the
interaction with the dual-homed host. Instead of requiring users to
deal directly with the dual-homed host, proxy systems allow all
interaction to take place behind the scenes. The user has the
illusion of dealing directly (or almost directly) with the server on
the Internet, with a minimum of direct interaction with the
dual-homed host. <a href="ch09_01.html#ch09-94077">Figure 9-1</a> illustrates the
difference between reality and illusion with proxy systems.</p><p>





<a name="ch09-94077" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="209" alt="Figure 9-1" src="figs/fire2.0901.gif" width="445" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-1. Proxies  --  reality and illusion</h4>

Proxy systems deal with the insecurity problems by avoiding user
logins on the dual-homed host and by forcing connections through
controlled software. Because the proxy software works without
requiring user logins, the host it runs on is safe from the
randomness of having multiple logins. It's also impossible for
anybody to install uncontrolled software to reach the Internet; the
proxy acts as a control point.</p><p>
