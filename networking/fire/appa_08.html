<h2 class="sect1">A.8. Papers</h2>





<a name="INDEX-2429" />This section contains a list of
papers about firewalls, security attacks, and related topics.
It is by no means an exhaustive list, but it does contain references
to some of the papers that we find the most interesting. To get
most of them, as well as many other papers, consult the extensive
collections available from the Telstra and CERIAS web pages described
earlier in this appendix.</p><p>





The following list does not include papers that describe topics that
are adequately described in this book, nor does it include papers
that simply describe software (such as Tripwire, TCP Wrapper, etc.)
that are mentioned in this book and cited in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>; up-to-date papers about tools are ordinarily
included with the tools themselves. The published versions of the
papers are out of date, so you will do better to get the papers or
documentation distributed with the software.</p><p>

Evening with Berferd in Which a Cracker Is Lured, Endured, and
Studied". <em class="emphasis">Proceedings of the Winter 1992 USENIX
Technical Conference</em>. USENIX Association. San Francisco.
January 20-24, 1992.</p><p>
Describes AT&amp;T's experiences with one particular cracker
who walked right into a trap and never knew he was the mouse being
toyed with by the cat. The best part of the story isn't in the
paper, however: how they got him to finally go away. The
cracker was in the Netherlands, and they were sure they knew who it
was, but there were no diplomatic channels through which they could
get the Dutch police to do anything about it (what the cracker was
doing wasn't illegal in the Netherlands, at least not at the
time). Finally, one of the Dutch system administrators they'd
been working with throughout the investigation got frustrated, called
the cracker's mother, and the problem went away.</p><p>
