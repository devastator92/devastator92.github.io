<a name="INDEX-1988" /><a name="INDEX-1989" /><h2 class="sect1">21.5. Kerberos</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1990" />Kerberos was developed at MIT by Project
Athena (the same folks who developed the X Window System). It is
designed to provide authentication and encryption services through
modified versions of standard clients and servers (e.g., Telnet
clients and servers).</p><p>





Kerberos provides strong authentication in a distributed environment,
and it is widely available. It is the primary source of
authentication in Windows 2000. Some other vendors also provide
Kerberos support with their operating systems; MIT has freely
available implementations for many versions of Unix; and the code is
freely available if you wish it to port it to an operating system
that does not yet have an implementation.</p><p>





Kerberos attempts to solve the problem where a client wants to talk
to a server over an untrusted network. The client and the server
don't have to trust each other or the network, but they have to
trust the Kerberos server (it is the trusted third party). Imagine a
courier attempting to deliver gems to a jewelry store. The jewelry
store doesn't want to let in a fake courier who might be a
robber; the courier doesn't want to give the gems to a fake
jeweler who might be a robber. If both of them trust a third party,
that person can verify the identity of both sides of the transaction.</p><p>





There have been two official releases of Kerberos, version 4 and
version 5. Version 5 was released in 1993 and fixed a number of
problems. We do not recommend using Kerberos version 4. MIT's
Unix code is freely available under license (see <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "Resources"</a>), but Kerberos is not in the public domain.
Because Kerberos needs to be integrated into everything that uses
authentication data, implementing Kerberos in your environment can be
tricky. Several companies and operating systems vendors offer
commercial versions of Kerberos where some or all of this work has
been done for you.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1991" />Windows 2000 uses
some extensions to Kerberos version 5. As a result, not all
operations are possible when you combine Windows 2000 with other
implementations of Kerberos. In particular, there is a high degree of
interoperability for authentication, but Windows 2000 also transfers
Windows-specific data used for authorization. Other implementations
of Kerberos will not have the authorization data available, so that
authentication may succeed while authorization fails. While this is
not technically a Kerberos interoperability problem (Kerberos is an
authentication protocol, and the authorization is not part of it),
the net result is that a Windows 2000 user who attempts to use a
non-Windows 2000 Kerberos server will probably be unable to get
access to Windows 2000 resources. On the other hand, other platforms
do not normally transfer authorization data this way, so a Windows
2000 Kerberos server can usually serve clients on other platforms.
(As we discuss in the section on packet filtering characteristics of
Kerberos, Windows 2000 uses TCP for some Kerberos transactions, and
other platforms do not; this can result in authentication failures,
particularly if the user is a valid Windows 2000 user with a full set
of Windows 2000 authorization information.)</p><p>





icrosoft's implementation of Kerberos uses Microsoft-specific
names for many Kerberos concepts. This is intended to ease the
transition to Kerberos for experienced Microsoft administrators by
making the names similar to the old names for similar functions, and
in some cases, the names may in fact be more intuitive. However, it
may confuse experienced Kerberos administrators. We use standard
Kerberos terminology, but when we introduce a term, we also give the
icrosoft-specific name where applicable.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">21.5.1. How It Works</h3>





Kerberos provides secure authentication for clients and servers
across an untrusted network, as long as the Kerberos authentication
servers themselves are protected from tampering. <a href="ch21_05.html#ch21-32230">Figure 21-3</a> shows the basic requirements for a Kerberos
network to be secure. Note that the trust relationships shown are the
only important ones. The application server can be completely
insecure, without being able to compromise anything. Similarly, the
user can be hostile and try to attack the authentication server or
the application server, without compromising security. The
authentication server must be protected, and the client software must
do what the user expects it to do. If either of these fails, security
will be compromised. If the time is not synchronized, security may be
compromised, but it's more likely that users will just be
unable to authenticate.</p><p>





<a name="ch21-32230" /><div class="figure"><img height="171" alt="Figure 21-3" src="figs/fire2.2103.gif" width="453" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 21-3. Kerberos requirements</h4>

Kerberos uses slightly different terminology from most authentication
systems. The area of authority of a Kerberos installation is called a
<em class="emphasis">realm</em>. A realm is equivalent to a Windows NT or
NIS domain, and in fact Windows 2000 uses <em class="emphasis">domain</em>
instead of realm. All versions of Kerberos refer to the parties
involved in a transaction as <em class="emphasis">principals</em>. A
principal is an entity that needs to be authenticated. In most cases,
a transaction involves a user talking to a server (for instance,
somebody trying to pick up mail with POP), and therefore principals
are normally users and services. In some cases, something else may
need to be authenticated. For instance, the principals in the
transaction when a machine transfers files for diskless booting are a
host and a server instead of a user and a server.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1992" /> <a name="INDEX-1993" />
<a name="INDEX-1994" />The
authentication server is also known as a <em class="emphasis">Key Distribution
Center</em>, or KDC. In Windows 2000, every domain controller
is also an authentication server.</p><p>





Every principal has a secret that is shared with the authentication
server. These secrets are known only by the principal and the
authentication server, and they are never passed around the network
unencrypted. However, principals identify each other every time they
interact. Every time a user makes a request of a server that uses
Kerberos, an identifier called a <em class="emphasis">ticket</em> is
handed to the server. That ticket is specific to the user and to the
server that the user is trying to use.</p><p>





This could be a nasty problem for the user. The secret that a user
shares with the authentication server is a password, and every time
that password is needed, the user has to type it in. (Having software
store the password is a major security risk.) Nobody wants to type in
a password every time he or she reads a file on a file server, prints
a file to a printer, or checks mail. The need to type in passwords is
reduced two ways. First, you don't need a new ticket every time
you interact with a service; tickets are all-day passes, typically
good for eight hours. Second, you don't always have to give a
password to get a ticket. Most services will accept tickets given out
by a <em class="emphasis">ticket-granting service</em>. The
ticket-granting service itself takes tickets (but it will accept only
ones given out directly by the authentication server).</p><p>





Suppose that you want to use a Kerberized POP server to read your
mail, and you haven't done anything else with Kerberos in the
last eight hours. When you ask to use the POP server, you will be
asked for your password. The client will ask the authentication
server for a ticket to the ticket-granting service and use the
password to complete the process. It will then present that ticket to
the ticket-granting service and ask for a ticket to the POP server.
Finally, it will present this second ticket to the POP server. If you
check your mail again, the client will give the same ticket to the
POP server. If you decide to print a piece of mail to a Kerberized
printing system, the client will take the ticket for the
ticket-granting service and ask for a ticket to the print server, all
without asking you for your password again. <a href="ch21_05.html#ch21-28325">Figure 21-4</a> shows the initial process for speaking to the
first application server.</p><p>





<a name="ch21-28325" /><div class="figure"><img height="256" alt="Figure 21-4" src="figs/fire2.2104.gif" width="434" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 21-4. Kerberos ticket exchange</h4>

In standard Kerberos terminology, the master ticket you get from the
ticket-granting service is called a <em class="emphasis">ticket granting
ticket</em>, or TGT. In Windows 2000, it is called a
<em class="emphasis">user ticket</em>. The ticket that is handed to an
application is called a <em class="emphasis">session ticket</em> in
standard Kerberos and a <em class="emphasis">service ticket</em> in
Windows 2000.</p><p>





Not all services will take a ticket that's given out by the
ticket-granting service; for that matter, not all services will let
you reuse a ticket. It's up to the service to decide how
paranoid to be. Services that let you change your password, for
instance, will normally require a ticket direct from the
authentication service. If you leave to get a cup of tea, somebody at
your keyboard will still be able to get tickets from the
ticket-granting service, but not from the authentication service,
because getting a ticket from the authentication service always
requires providing a password.</p><p>





In most Kerberos implementations, the password that the user types in
as part of the authentication process is a fixed password. This
password never crosses the network in the clear (so it can't be
sniffed). On the other hand, nothing prevents an attacker from simply
guessing the password. Kerberos goes to some lengths to avoid storing
the password, even in encrypted form, where an attacker can get at it
to optimize guessing attacks, but attackers are still free to try
guessing the hard way (simply trying out passwords to see if they
work). Some implementations support one-time password systems to
prevent these attacks.</p><p>

<a name="ch21-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.5.2. Extending Trust</h3>





Kerberos realms can trust each other, so that users who authenticate
in one Kerberos realm can use resources in another. This is
accomplished by using inter-realm tickets, which allow a
ticket-granting service in one realm to issue tickets for another.
Trust between Kerberos realms is transitive; if the chemistry
department's realm trusts the realm run by the college of
physical science, and so does the physics department, chemistry and
physics trust each other.</p><p>





When a service gets a ticket from outside the service's realm,
the ticket includes information about the realm that originally
issued the ticket, and all the realms that the ticket has gone
through. In the preceding example, when a user in chemistry sends a
ticket to a service in physics, the service will see that the ticket
was issued in chemistry and passed through the college of physical
science. The service can then use this information to decide what
privileges the user should have.</p><p>





Inter-realm trusts don't particularly change the firewall
issues with using Kerberos. A firewall that's between two
realms will see the same sorts of traffic as a firewall that's
between two parts of the same realm, except for initial
authentication.</p><p>

<a name="ch21-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.5.3. Packet Filtering Characteristics of Kerberos</h3>





Kerberos v5 uses the assigned port 88 for ticket request operations.
Although the Kerberos protocol specifies the use of UDP, Windows 2000
may also use TCP for some requests. This is because Windows 2000
tickets contain more information than standard Kerberos tickets and
therefore may be larger than will fit in a single 1,500-byte UDP
packet. When this happens, the client will make an initial request
over UDP, receive a truncated answer, and repeat the request over
TCP. (This is a standard mechanism in several UDP-based protocols,
including DNS and WINS, which allows most requests to use
low-overhead UDP, while falling back to the more expensive TCP as an
easy means to accommodate occasionally larger data transfers.)</p><p>

All packets contain authenticators and integrity checksums. In order
to start a conversation with a Kerberos server, you need to have
previously arranged to share a secret with the server. This means
that it is likely that you will be able to detect attempts by foreign
machines to obtain Kerberos credentials. On the other hand, it means
that you will need to have a set of processes and procedures so that
you can add and remove systems from your Kerberos realms.</p><p>

<a name="ch21-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.5.4. Proxying and Network Address Translation Characteristics of Kerberos</h3>





Kerberos authenticator packets include the IP addresses of the
originating system. These addresses are supposed to be checked
against the source IP address (although it does not appear that all
implementations actually make this check) to prevent the packet from
being sniffed and replayed from a different IP address. This makes it
difficult to use Kerberos with proxies or network address translation
because the IP address in the packet will be the address of the
internal host, while the source address will be the proxy server or
the translated address.</p><p>





One solution, which requires modifications to the Kerberos
sources,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-136">[136]</a> is to have the internal systems add the external IP
addresses to all Kerberos packets. This effectively disables the IP
address checking performed by remote systems. It also means that the
internal systems are trusting not only the Kerberos server, but also
the proxy or address translation system, which is capable of
masquerading as any internal host. This significantly raises the
risk; Kerberos servers are highly protected machines, but proxy and
address translation servers are extremely exposed.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-136" />[136]The modification was written by Ken
Hornstein and is available at <a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/aces/kerberos/misc_patches/patch.app-proxy">ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/aces/kerberos/misc_patches/patch.app-proxy</a>.</p><p>




</blockquote>





Since Kerberos is UDP-based, there are also the usual problems with
UDP proxying; the proxy machine has to keep track of the state in
order to know what packets are responses to what requests. This can
cause difficulties in situations where there are lots of transactions
or where packets are being lost.</p><p>





It's worth noting that Kerberos also has a concept of
<em class="emphasis">proxy tickets</em>. These are tickets that allow a
server to act on behalf of another principal (for instance, a print
service may use them to access a user's files). They
don't have anything to do with proxying in the firewall sense.</p><p>
