<h2 class="sect1">10.12. Protecting the Machine and Backups</h2>





<a name="INDEX-861" /><a name="INDEX-862" /><a name="INDEX-863" />Once the bastion
host has been fully configured and is in operation, protect the
physical machine and make sure that its backups are protected from
theft or other compromise.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">10.12.1. Watch Reboots Carefully </h3>





<a name="INDEX-864" /><a name="INDEX-865" /><a name="INDEX-866" /><a name="INDEX-867" />How will you know if someone
has breached security? Sometimes, it's painfully obvious. But
sometimes, you'll have to draw conclusions from the behavior of
the system. Unexplained reboots or downtime on the system may be a
clue. Many attacks (e.g., modifying a kernel) can't succeed
unless the system is rebooted.</p><p>





On the bastion host, crashes and reboots should be rare occurrences.
Once the bastion host has been fully configured and is in production,
it should be a very stable system, often running for weeks or months
at a stretch without a crash or a reboot. If a crash or a reboot does
occur, investigate it immediately to determine whether it was caused
by some legitimate problem or might have been the result of some kind
of attack.</p><p>





You might want to consider configuring the bastion host so that it
doesn't bring itself up automatically after an attempted
reboot. That way, if someone does manage to crash or force a reboot
of the machine, you'll know about it: the machine will sit
there waiting for you to reboot it. The machine won't be able
to come back up until you decide it should do so. Many machines treat
crashes and explicit reboots differently, and while most of them will
let you disable an automatic reboot on a crash, it may be harder to
disable an automatic reboot after a clean shutdown that requests a
reboot. Even if your machine does not appear to allow you to disable
autobooting, you can usually cause autoboots to fail under Unix by
configuring the machine to autoboot from a nonexistent disk. (Be sure
to leave instructions on how to boot the machine by hand with the
machine.) Under Windows NT, you can simply edit
<em class="filename">boot.ini</em> to set the timeout to -1, and it will
wait forever for a human being to specify what operating system to
boot. This has the advantage of being self-explanatory to an operator
sitting in front of the console.</p><p>

<a name="ch10-3990" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.12.2. Do Secure Backups</h3>





Backups on a bastion host are tricky because of trust issues. Who can
you trust?</p><p>





You definitely don't want internal machines to trust the
bastion host enough for it to dump to their tape drives. If the
bastion host has somehow been compromised, this could be disastrous.
You also don't want the bastion host to trust the internal
machines; this could lead to subversion of the bastion host by
(well-intentioned) internal users, or to attack from some host
pretending to be an internal system.</p><p>





Common remote backup mechanisms (for example, those used by the BSD
<em class="emphasis">dump</em> and <em class="emphasis">rdump</em> programs)
will probably be blocked by packet filtering between the bastion host
and the internal systems anyway. Therefore, you will normally want to
do backups to a tape device attached directly to the bastion host.
Under no circumstances should you rely on backing up the bastion host
to disks that remain attached to the bastion host. You must do
backups that are removed from the bastion host so they cannot be
accessed by an attacker who compromises it.</p><p>





Fortunately, because the bastion host is an infrequently changing
machine, you won't have to do frequent backups. Once the
bastion host is fully configured and in production, it should be very
stable. A weekly or even monthly manual backup will probably be
sufficient.</p><p>





Backups of the bastion host aren't done just to guard against
normal system catastrophes like disk crashes. They're also a
tool that you can use later to investigate a break-in or some other
security incident. They give you a way to compare what's
currently on the bastion host's disk with what was there before
the incident.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-868" /><a name="INDEX-869" />If you're only doing weekly or
monthly backups, how you handle logging becomes an issue. If the
bastion host is not being backed up daily, you <em class="emphasis">must
</em>do your logging to some system other than the bastion host
itself. If an incident does occur, the logs are going to be critical
in reconstructing what happened. If it turns out that your only copy
of the logs was on the (compromised) bastion host, and backups of the
logs haven't been done for three weeks, you're going to
be severely hampered in your investigative efforts.</p><p>





As with all backups on all systems, you need to guard your bastion
host backups as carefully as you guard the machine itself. The
bastion host backups contain all the configuration information for
the bastion host. An attacker who gets access to these backups would
be able to analyze the security of your bastion host without ever
touching it. The information these backups provide might possibly
include a way to break in without setting off any of the alarms on
the bastion host.<a name="INDEX-870" /><a name="INDEX-871" /><a name="INDEX-872" /><a name="INDEX-873" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch10-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.12.3. Other Objects to Secure</h3>





In addition to securing the backups, you will need to physically
secure anything else that contains important data about the machine.
This includes:</p><p>





<ul><li>The log files</p><p></li><li>Any alternate boot disks you use to do maintenance</p></li><li><p>The Emergency Repair Disks for Windows NT bastion hosts (including
account data!)</p><p></li><li>The documentation for the details of the bastion host configuration</p></li></ul>
Although secrecy is not sufficient to give you security, it's
an important part of maintaining security. You should treat the
configuration details of your bastion hosts as proprietary
information, available only to people you trust. Anybody who has this
information can compromise your firewall.</p><p>
