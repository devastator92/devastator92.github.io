<h2 class="sect1">6.6. Terminal Servers and Modem Pools</h2>





<a name="INDEX-455" /><a name="INDEX-456" /><a name="INDEX-457" /><a name="INDEX-458" /><a name="INDEX-459" />Another
issue that is only somewhat related to firewalls (but that the
security folks putting up firewalls are often asked to address) is
where to locate the terminal servers and modem pools within a
site's network. You definitely need to pay as much attention to
the security of your dial-up access ports as you do to the security
of your Internet connection. However, dial-up security
(authentication systems, callback systems, etc.) is a whole topic of
its own, separate from firewalls. We'll therefore restrict our
comments to those related to firewalls.</p><p>





The big firewall question concerning terminal servers and modem pools
is where to put them: do you put them inside your security perimeter,
or outside? (This is similar to the question of where to put
encryption endpoints in a virtual private network, discussed
earlier.) Our advice is to put them on the inside and to protect them
carefully. You'll not only be doing yourself a favor,
you'll also be a good neighbor. Putting open terminal servers
on the Internet is a risk to other people's sites as well as
your own.</p><p>





If the modem ports are going to be used primarily to access internal
systems and data (that is, employees working from home or on the
road), then it makes sense to put them on the inside. If you put them
on the outside, you'd have to open holes in your perimeter to
allow them access to the internal systems and data  --  holes that
an attacker might be able to take advantage of. Also, if you put them
on the outside, then an attacker who has compromised your perimeter
(broken into your bastion host, for example) could potentially
monitor the work your users do, essentially looking over their
shoulders as they access private, sensitive data. If you do put the
modems on the inside, you'll have to protect them very
carefully, so they don't become an easier break-in target than
your firewall. It doesn't do any good to build a first-class
firewall if someone can bypass it by dialing into an unprotected
modem connected to the internal network.</p><p>





On the other hand, if the modem ports are going to be used primarily
to access external systems (that is, by employees or guests who
mainly use your site as an access point for the Internet), then it
makes more sense to put them on the outside. There's no sense
in giving someone access to your internal systems if he or she
doesn't need it. This external modem pool should be treated
just as suspiciously as the bastion host and the other components of
your firewall.</p><p>





If you find that you need both types of access, then you might want
to consider two modem pools: one on the inside, carefully protected,
to access internal systems, and another on the outside to access the
Internet.</p><p>





If your terminal servers and modem pools are being used to support
dial-up network connections from homes or other sites, you should
make sure you enforce any implicit assumptions you have about that
usage. For instance, people setting up PPP accounts on terminal
servers generally assume that the PPP account is going to be used by
a single remote machine running standalone. More and more machines,
however, are part of local area networks, even at home (Dad's
PC is in the den, Mom's in the living room). That PPP
connection could be used not just by the machine you set it up for,
but by anything that machine is connected to, and anything those
machines are connected to, and so forth. The machine that uses the
PPP account might be connected to a local area network, with any
number of other machines on it; any of them might be connected (via
other PPP connections, for example) to another site or an Internet
service provider. If you don't do anything to prevent it,
traffic could flow from the Internet, to the second PC, to the
"legitimate" PC, and finally into your own net,
completely bypassing your firewall.</p><p>





You can prevent this problem by simply enabling packet filtering on
the PPP connection that limits what it <em class="emphasis">can</em> do to
what you <em class="emphasis">expect</em> it to do (i.e., that limits
packets on the connection to only packets to or from the machine you
expect to be at the other end of the connection).</p><p>





Some sites with significant dial-up networking activity take the
approach of building a separate firewall just for that activity. See
the previous discussion of multiple perimeter networks.</p><p>





We discuss remote access protocols further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>, and we discuss the authentication protocols
generally used to protect modem pools and terminal servers in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21, "Authentication and Auditing Services"</a>.<a name="INDEX-460" /><a name="INDEX-461" /><a name="INDEX-462" /><a name="INDEX-463" /></p><p>
