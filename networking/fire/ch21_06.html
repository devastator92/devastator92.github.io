<h2 class="sect1">21.6. NTLM Domains</h2>





NTLM domains provide user and group authentication for Windows
machines. It is not clear exactly what "NTLM" stands for,
although presumably it's something like "NT Logon
anager". Until Windows 2000, these were simply called
<em class="emphasis">domains</em>.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1996" /> <a name="INDEX-1997" />The
term <em class="emphasis">domain</em> is used in an unfortunately large
number of contexts in the networking world. There are DNS domains,
NIS domains, NTLM domains, and now Kerberos domains, all of them
similar (in that they indicate regions of administrative control) and
yet distinctively different. NTLM domains, like NIS domains and
Kerberos realms, control information about users and groups. They are
not tied to machine names but are a source of authentication and
authorization information.</p><p>





Under Windows NT, domain means an NTLM domain. Under Windows 2000,
domain by default means a Kerberos realm. However, Windows 2000
machines are able to authenticate in NTLM domains, and Windows 2000
domain controllers can be configured to provide both Kerberos and
NTLM services (for instance, to allow older operating systems to
authenticate).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1998" />The computers that hold the
information are called <em class="emphasis">domain controllers</em>. An
NTLM domain has one computer that is a primary domain controller and
may have one or more computers that are backup domain controllers.
Any domain controller can do user authentication, but database
changes (password changes, user additions or deletions, changes to
group membership) all take place on the primary domain controller and
are distributed from there to the backup domain controllers.</p><p>





When a user wishes to log in to a computer that is part of an NTLM
domain using a user account that is in a NTLM domain, the user
provides a username, a password, and the name of a domain. The
computer passes the provided information to the computer's
domain controller. If the domain controller is able to authenticate
the user with that information, it returns a security identifier; if
not, it returns an error. The computer then checks the access
permissions of the security identifier to see if that security
identifier is permitted to log in, and if so, continues the login
process. Note that this procedure separates authentication from
authorization; it is possible to authenticate correctly and still be
unable to log in because there is no authorization to do so.</p><p>





If authentication is successful, the client will cache the
information locally. If a user tries to log in and no domain
controller is available, the client will use the cached information.
If a domain controller is available, the cache will not be consulted.
ost clients cache 10-15 sets of credentials (the default is 10, but
it is modifiable). If you remove a user account from a domain, the
user will still be able to log into any computer they have recently
logged into, as long as they first disconnect it from the network. In
addition, anybody with Administrator access to the machine can read
the cached credentials. Because the cached credentials are stored in
a doubly hashed form, standard password crackers will not work
against them; on the other hand, it would be possible to write a
cracker for them, and presumably somebody eventually will. In
security-critical environments, you should disable credential
caching; in Windows NT 4, it can be done by setting the following
registry key to 0:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon\
Cached Logons Count</pre></blockquote>





Normally, the domain controller will authenticate the user locally.
However, there are two cases where the domain controller will ask
another domain controller for information. First, if the domain the
user wants to authenticate in is not the one controlled by the domain
controller, the domain controller may be able to forward the request
to an appropriate domain controller. Second, if the domain controller
is a backup domain controller and authentication fails, the backup
domain controller will forward the request to the primary domain
controller just in case there's been an update that has not yet
been distributed.</p><p>





In order for a domain controller to forward an authentication request
into another domain, the two domains must have a pre-existing
relationship called a <em class="emphasis">trust relationship</em>. If you
are willing to accept another domain's authentication, you
trust that domain. Trust relationships are one-way; if the domain
"sheep" decides to trust the domain "wolves",
it does not require "wolves" to trust
"sheep".<a href="#FOOTNOTE-137">[137]</a> In NTLM
domains, trusts are also nontransitive: if "sheep" trusts
"wolves", and "wolves" trusts
"lions", it does <em class="emphasis">not</em> mean that
"sheep" trusts "lions". (Windows 2000 domains
are Kerberos realms, and Kerberos trust relationships are
transitive.)</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-137" />[137]You will hear
"bidirectional trusts" mentioned; this is actually just a
convenient shorthand for a pair of trusts.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">21.6.1. Finding a Domain Controller</h3>





There are two ways to find a domain controller: broadcast and WINS
(for more information about NetBIOS naming and WINS, see <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>). Clients that are configured to use broadcast
name resolution will also use broadcast to find domain controllers,
although the broadcasts are different (they are sent to the NETLOGON
name). Clients that are configured to use WINS for name resolution
will use WINS name resolution to find domain controllers by looking
up the NetBIOS group with the name of the domain and the type 1C (for
the domain "sheep", it would be
"SHEEP&lt;1C&gt;"). Once a client has used WINS to get a
list of domain controllers, it sends a directed packet to each domain
controller in the list. Regardless of the way that a client looks for
domain controllers, it selects the first domain controller to
respond. <a name="INDEX-1999" /></p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch21-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.2. The Logon Process</h3>





There are two ways for the actual logon process to occur: one based
on SMB and one based on Microsoft RPC. Most machines use the
SMB-based process; machines running Windows NT Server use the
icrosoft RPC process. In the SMB-based process, once a machine has
identified a domain controller, it makes an SMB connection to the
domain controller, using standard SMB authentication of the user, and
connects to the IPC$ share. It then uses remote API calls to finish
the process of getting a security token for the user. The Microsoft
RPC process is similar; it sets up a secure channel (described in the
next section) and then uses remote API calls across it.</p><p>





Regardless of which way the initial logon is done, the machine will
connect to the domain controller with SMB to look for a policy file.
In fact, this will be done even if the user is authenticated locally,
without involving the domain controller at all.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch21-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.3. Secure Channel Setup</h3>





Each Windows NT server that is part of a Windows NT domain sets up a
secure channel to a domain controller when the computer starts up. In
addition, at startup time, each backup domain controller sets up a
secure channel to its primary domain controller. A secure channel is
also used for the communication between domains that have a trust
relationship. A secure channel is simply an authenticated connection
over Microsoft RPC where the two ends have a shared secret that can
be used to encrypt data. Depending on the service pack that is
installed and the configuration of the machine, some or all of the
information sent across the secure channel will be encrypted with the
shared secret.</p><p>





The username and password information is passed across the secure
channel in a decryptable form. No challenge-response and no hashing
is used; the domain controller will decrypt the password and use it
in cleartext form. If the domain controller is compromised, the
intruder will be able to log passwords. (Note that a compromised
domain controller already gives the intruder control of the site; it
is a minor addition to the thousands of horrible things that somebody
can do when they control the domain.)</p><p>





In some implementations, when a server initially joins a domain, it
uses a well-known password to set up the first secure channel. An
attacker who can eavesdrop on this initial conversation can decrypt
it and can read all the information in it, including the password
change to a new password that will be used for future secure
channels. At this point, the attacker can decrypt all information in
the secure channel, including passwords, until there is a password
change that they don't manage to eavesdrop on. It is critical
to protect this initial secure channel from eavesdroppers (for
instance, by putting the server and the domain controller on a
switched network where other machines cannot see the traffic); the
secure channel is believed to be reasonably secure as long as the
password is unknown and is changed with reasonable frequency, but
once a password is compromised, the channel is completely insecure.
Service Pack 6 for Windows NT 4 addresses this problem, which is also
fixed in Windows 2000.</p><p>

<a name="ch21-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.4. SMB Authentication</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2000" />
<a name="INDEX-2001" />
<a name="INDEX-2002" />When an SMB client connects to
an SMB server, the client and server negotiate which dialect of SMB
they are going to use. This negotiation mainly controls the method
used to exchange authentication data. There are four ways to exchange
user authentication data (listed here in order from oldest to newest,
which is also from weakest to strongest):</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Cleartext</i></dt>
<dd>The client sends the server the username and the unencrypted password
(an ASCII string up to 24 characters long).</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>LanMan 1.2</i></dt>
<dd>Challenge-response, using LanMan password hashing. The server sends a
challenge; the client takes an ASCII password, uppercases it,
converts it to exactly 14 characters (truncating or padding with
spaces as necessary), uses the result as a key to encrypt a fixed
8-byte string, appends five nulls, uses the result as a key to
encrypt the challenge, and returns that value.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>NT LM 0.12 </i></dt>
<dd>Challenge-response, using Windows NT password hashing and verifying
only the client. The server sends a challenge; the client takes the
password, represented in Unicode,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-138">[138]</a>
calculates a 16-byte MD4 message digest of it, appends five nulls,
uses the result as a key to encrypt the challenge, and returns the
value. The server calculates the same value and verifies the user if
they match.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-138" />[138]Unicode is a system
for representing text that allows a larger character set than the
ASCII encoding normally used for English text. Although this
authentication method would theoretically allow for passwords in
Unicode, vastly increasing the available characters that could be
used in passwords, most systems will allow only users to enter ASCII
characters. This may be different in clients designed for languages
that do not have adequate ASCII representations.</p><p>




</blockquote></dd>





<dt><i>NT LM++ </i></dt>
<dd>Challenge-response, using Windows NT encryption with mutual
verification. The server sends a challenge; the client sends back its
own challenge, and the server's challenge, encrypted with a
value derived from the password. The server calculates the same
result and verifies the user if they match. The server then
calculates a different value based on the password, encrypts the
client's challenge with it, and returns it to the client, which
can then verify that the server also knows the password.</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Not all servers and clients will support all of these methods. Some
of the servers and clients were written before all of the methods had
been developed and therefore do not support the newer, safer methods;
others refuse to support older methods for security reasons. For
instance, if a malicious server can negotiate the use of cleartext
passwords, clients will simply send all their authentication data to
it in a form suitable for reuse. Less obviously, there's a
smaller risk to a server that allows a client to negotiate cleartext
passwords. Not only are the passwords open to password sniffing, but
a malicious client that can negotiate cleartext passwords has a much
easier time attempting to guess passwords, since it doesn't
have to waste CPU time encrypting the guesses. You should be sure
that both servers and clients are configured to refuse to use
cleartext passwords.<a name="INDEX-2003" /> <a name="INDEX-2004" /> <a name="INDEX-2005" /></p><p>

<a name="ch21-15-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.5. Accessing Other Computers</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2006" />
<a name="INDEX-2007" />A user may want to access a computer other
than the one he or she originally logged into (for instance, to use a
printer, access files remotely, or use a program like the Event
Viewer). When this happens, a Windows NT machine will usually try
four ways of authenticating on the remote computer, in order:</p><p>





<ol><li>Provide the username, password, and domain information the user
originally used. This will work only if the remote computer is a
member of the same domain or a trusting domain.</p><p></li><li>Provide the username and password without the domain information.
This will work if the remote computer has an account with the same
username and password.</p><p></li><li>Ask the user for a new password and provide the original username
with the new password. This will work if the remote computer has an
account with the same username but a different password.</p><p></li><li>Request guest access to the remote computer.</p></li></ol>
This means that it is possible to accidentally grant access to remote
users if you happen to create an account with a username and password
that matches one in use in another domain.</p><p>





In some circumstances, you will be able to specify username,
password, and domain information explicitly. In particular, you can
usually specify this information when accessing files but not when
running programs.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch21-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.6. Alternate Authentication Methods</h3>





Windows NT machines are not required to use NetLogon to authenticate
users. The authentication process is handled by a module called the
Graphical Identification and Authorization (GINA) module, and other
modules can be used instead of the normal NetLogon process. (Note
that this is authentication for local resources only; using resources
from other servers will require reauthentication.) The most common
use of it in mixed Windows NT-Unix networks is something called
NISGINA, which allows Windows NT machines to use NIS for
authentication.<a name="INDEX-2008" /> <a name="INDEX-2009" />
<a name="INDEX-2010" /></p><p>





An attacker who has Administrator access to a Windows NT machine can
use this feature to install additional authentication modules. It is
particularly easy to write a module that saves the provided username
and password information for the attacker's future use.</p><p>





If the relevant registry keys do not have the correct permissions, it
may be possible for an attacker to install additional authentication
modules without first having Administrator access. As shipped, these
keys are protected, but it's important to make sure that
protection is maintained if you change anything, particularly on the
following key:</p><p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa<a name="INDEX-2011" />
<a name="INDEX-2012" /></pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">21.6.7. Controller-to-Controller Communication</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2013" />Domain controllers speak to each other
for a number of purposes:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Communication within domains</i></dt>
<dd>Primary domain controllers replicate information to backup domain
controllers; they transfer authentication information via NetLogon
and profiles and policies via directory replication.</p><p>





At startup, backup domain controllers establish a secure channel to
the primary controller, used for pass-through authentication and for
replication.</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Communication between domains</i></dt>
<dd>The secure channel is used for pass-through authentication between
trusted domains.</p><p>





In addition, once a week, the primary domain controller contacts the
primary domain controller for each trusted domain controller to
change the password used to establish secure channels with that
domain.</p><p></dd>

<h3 class="sect2">21.6.8. The User Manager</h3>





Changing user information (adding and removing users, changing
passwords and rights) needs to be done via different protocols from
those used for authentication. Administrators manage accounts using
the User Manager for Domains, which connects to the primary domain
controller using SMB transactions.<a name="INDEX-2014" /></p><p>

Windows NT domain authentication is based on SMB and Microsoft RPC,

name services, which are discussed in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>.
We will call machines that use domain authentication but not secure
channels <em class="emphasis">domain participants</em> ; this includes
machines running Windows 98, for instance. Machines that use the
