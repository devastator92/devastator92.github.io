<h2 class="sect1">11.6. Running a Security Audit</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1019" /> <a name="INDEX-1020" /> <a name="INDEX-1021" />Several very good automated auditing
packages are freely available on the Internet. The four most commonly
used are these:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i><a name="INDEX-1022" /><em class="emphasis">COPS</em></i></dt>
<dd>The Computer Oracle and Password System, developed by Dan Farmer and
Gene Spafford</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>SATAN</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1023" />Security
Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks (also known as
SANTA), developed by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><a name="INDEX-1024" /><em class="emphasis">Tiger</em></i></dt>
<dd>Developed as part of the TAMU package by Texas A&amp;M University</p><p></dd>





<dt><i><a name="INDEX-1025" /><a name="INDEX-1026" /><em class="emphasis">Tripwire</em></i></dt>
<dd>Developed by Gene H. Kim and Gene Spafford</p><p></dd>

</dl>





COPS and Tiger both check for well-known security holes on the host
they are run on. There is significant overlap in what COPS and Tiger
check; however, they're both free, so it's a good idea to
obtain and run both of them to get the best possible coverage.
Tripwire is a filesystem integrity checker. It is strictly a tool for
dealing with checksum databases; it is much better at this than
either COPS or Tiger (which both have basic checksum database
capabilities) but has no ability to check for well-known security
holes. SATAN is a network-based application which tests hosts other
than the one it is running on. These packages are independent of each
other; there's nothing to prevent you from using all of them in
combination on your bastion host, and that would probably be a good
idea. <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "Tools"</a>, gives you information on how to
get all four packages.</p><p>





Because the well-known security holes tend to be somewhat operating
system-specific, the effectiveness of the packages that check for
these security holes is very dependent on which operating system you
have, and which version of the operating system it is. If it's
an operating system and version the package knows about, that's
great. If it isn't, then the package has to grope around
blindly, trying to guess what holes might exist. (Fortunately,
attackers will usually have the same problem, if not to the same
extent.) In some cases, packages will report holes that don't
exist when they're run on unfamiliar systems.</p><p>





Commercial packages that perform similar functions are now available.
In general, the security scanning products are similar to PC virus
software in that they require periodic updates in order to keep up
with the latest
vulnerabilities.<a name="INDEX-1027" /></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1028" /><a name="INDEX-1029" /><a name="INDEX-1030" /><a name="INDEX-1031" />When you are doing security
audits, you should be sure to use an appropriate checksum program.
The standard Unix checksum programs (<em class="emphasis">/bin/sum</em>,
for example) use a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm
that is designed to catch a sequence of random bit errors during data
transfers. This does not work for detecting unauthorized changes to
files because it is possible to reverse the CRC algorithm. This is
known to attackers, and they have programs that manipulate the unused
bytes in a file (particularly an executable binary file) to make the
checksum for that file come out to whatever they want it to be. They
can make a modified copy of <em class="emphasis">/bin/login</em> that
produces the same checksum, and <em class="emphasis">sum</em> will not be
able to detect any difference.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1032" />For
real security, you need to use a "cryptographic" checksum
algorithm like MD5 or Snefru; these algorithms produce larger and
less predictable checksums that are much more difficult to spoof. The
COPS, Tiger, and Tripwire auditing packages mentioned earlier all
include and use such algorithms in place of the normal Unix checksum
programs.</p><p>





The IRIX operating system from Silicon Graphics uses a process called
<em class="emphasis">re-quickstarting</em> (RQS) to precalculate data
needed for loading binaries and to speed up start time. RQS is run
automatically as a part of most installations and can update every
system binary. This should not be a problem on a bastion host, where
software should not be installed regularly in any case. However, you
should be aware that small installations may have wide-ranging
effects and will require the recalculation of all
checksums.<a name="INDEX-1033" /> <a name="INDEX-1034" /> <a name="INDEX-1035" /> <a name="INDEX-1036" /><a name="INDEX-1037" /> <a name="INDEX-1038" /> <a name="INDEX-1039" /></p><p>
