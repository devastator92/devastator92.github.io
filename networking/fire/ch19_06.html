<h2 class="sect1">19.6. Multicast and the Multicast Backbone (MBONE)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1816" /><a name="INDEX-1817" /><a name="INDEX-1818" /><a name="INDEX-1819" />As
we discussed in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>, IP supports three kinds
of packets; <em class="emphasis">unicast</em> (addressed to a single
host), <em class="emphasis">broadcast</em> (addressed to all hosts), and
<em class="emphasis">multicast</em> (addressed to a group of hosts).
ulticast IP packets look just like regular IP packets with
destination addresses that are in the range 224.0.0.0 through
239.255.255.255. An individual address in this range (224.0.1.1, for
instance) is called a <em class="emphasis">multicast group</em> (because
it addresses a group of hosts).</p><p>





Because of the nature of multicast, it makes sense only to multicast
IP protocols that are not session oriented. One host cannot usefully
set up a single session with multiple other hosts. Since TCP is
session oriented, a TCP packet should never have a multicast
destination address. Currently the only IP protocols that are
normally seen with multicast destination addresses are UDP, IGMP, and
OSPF. Similarly, multicast addresses are valid only as destination
addresses, not as source addresses (a packet can't come from a
group of hosts).</p><p>





ulticasting is particularly useful when you're dealing with
high-bandwidth loss-tolerant applications like audio and video
conferencing. With such applications, you may have a number of
stations all receiving the same stream of packets, and the stream may
consume a significant fraction of the available network bandwidth. If
a given stream consumes 10 percent of your available network
bandwidth (which is not uncommon), you wouldn't want to unicast
it to each interested host because each of these unicasts would
consume another 10 percent of your bandwidth, limiting you to 10
participating hosts, and that assumes that you did nothing else with
the network. You also wouldn't want to broadcast it to all
hosts unless all (or almost all) of your hosts were actually
interested in the stream because it places a significant load on each
host to process a broadcast packet and then decide to ignore it.</p><p>





ulticast groups are somewhat like cable television channels. A
variety of channels (multicast groups), such as HBO, CNN, ESPN, and
TV, are available, but most homes (hosts) subscribe to only a few of
the available channels. Some multicast groups are permanent; that is,
certain addresses are reserved for certain uses, such as NTP, video
conferencing of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meetings, NASA
Select video feeds (whenever the space shuttle is in orbit), and so
on. Other multicast groups are transient: set up for a particular
purpose or event and then shut down when they are no longer needed,
to be reused for something else later on.</p><p>





ulticasting is being used on the Internet today primarily for
real-time conferencing services, including video, audio, and
electronic whiteboard services. It's starting to be used for
other services as well, such as transmitting Usenet news efficiently
to a wide body of recipients.</p><p>





Not all networks will pass multicast traffic. Some networks refuse to
pass multicast in order to preserve network bandwidth, and others use
routing hardware that doesn't understand multicast. In either
case, it is possible to use multicast, while controlling the traffic
that is passed, by using multicast <em class="emphasis">tunnels</em>.</p><p>





A common approach to linking two multicast-capable networks (such as
Ethernets) over a unicast-only network (such as a T1 leased line) is
to create a <em class="emphasis">tunnel</em> over the unicast network,
with multicast routers (often called <em class="emphasis">mrouters</em>)
at either end of the tunnel. These <em class="emphasis">mrouters</em> take
multicast IP packets, encapsulate them into unicast IP packets, and
send them (via regular IP unicast) to the
<em class="emphasis">mrouter</em> on the other end, which unencapsulates
them to turn them back into multicast IP packets. By creating a web
of <em class="emphasis">mrouters</em> and tunnels, you can create a
virtual multicast network on top of a unicast backbone.</p><p>





The MBONE is the ad hoc Multicast Backbone on the Internet and is
just such a web of <em class="emphasis">mrouters</em> and tunnels. Its
participants are sites that are interested in using IP multicasting
for a variety of services on the Internet.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1820" /> <a name="INDEX-1821" />IP
multicasting brings up several firewall issues. If a site uses
tunneling to take part in the MBONE, what do the packets for the
tunnels look like? What could be sent through the tunnels? If a site
doesn't use tunnels, but uses IP multicasting directly, how
will the site's packet filtering system deal with it? Can
nonmulticast services (such as SMTP and NFS) be accessed by attackers
via multicast, whether or not they're tunneled?</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1822" />IP
multicast tunneling is currently done with IP-in-IP encapsulation,
which is discussed further in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Packets and Protocols "</a>. IP
multicast tunnels used to be done with source-routed IP packets, but
this practice caused a number of problems (not the least of which was
upsetting folks who had firewalls), and it is no longer recommended.</p><p>





To prevent a multicast tunnel from being used as a back door into or
out of a network, the current publicly available
<em class="emphasis">mrouter</em> code will only accept multicast packets
through the tunnel; it won't accept unicast packets shoved
through the tunnel in an attempt to bypass your firewall. If
you're using a commercial multicast router, rather than the
publicly available code off the Internet, you should verify that it
will behave in a similar way.</p><p>





If you have routers and a network topology that support multicast
directly, without tunnels, you still have to worry about how any
packet filtering system you use is going to cope with it. It
shouldn't be too difficult, though, because from a packet
filtering point of view, multicast packets look just like regular
packets with somewhat unusual destination addresses (addresses in the
range 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255). Treat them just as you
would anything else: block them all by default and allow the ones you
understand and want to support. Keep in mind that each of these
multicast addresses is going to apply to multiple internal machines,
and that if you're accepting multicast packets from the outside
world, then all of the internal machines that are accepting those
packets will have to be protected against attack from the outside
world  --  just as if you were accepting any other packets
directly from the outside world. Multicast routing is handled by a
special protocol called IGMP, which is discussed in <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22, "Administrative Services"</a>.</p><p>





For a long time, multicast was used almost exclusively for
multimedia, but there are now more and more uses of multicast for
administrative protocols. This has made accepting multicast much more
risky, since there are now vulnerable services (NIS under Unix, WINS
replication under Windows NT) that support multicast.</p><p>





Even if your tunnel is restricted to only multicast packets, or if
you're using multicast directly without tunneling, and you have
protected risky servers that support multicast, there is still the
question of how your hosts will respond to multicast packets
addressed to regular ports, such as your SMTP and NFS ports. Behavior
varies from operating system to operating system, and even from
release to release within the same operating system. If your
operating system's code is based on release 3.3 or later of the
"IP Multicast Extensions for BSD-Derived Unix Systems"
from Xerox PARC and the University of Delaware, then your system
should be safe against these kinds of attacks. Unless you installed
the multicast extensions yourself, however, you could have a very
difficult time determining what your operating system's
multicast code is based on. (Your best bet is to ask your vendor, but
don't be surprised if it's difficult to find anybody who
knows.)<a name="INDEX-1823" /><a name="INDEX-1824" /></p><p>
