<h2 class="sect1">2.4. File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing</h2>





<a name="INDEX-128" /><a name="INDEX-129" />Electronic mail transfers data from
place to place, but it's designed for small files in
human-readable form. Electronic mail transfer protocols are allowed
to make changes in a message that are acceptable to humans (for
instance, inserting "&gt;" before the word
"From" at the beginning of a line, so the mailer
doesn't get it confused with a header line) but are
unacceptable to programs.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-3" />[3]Inserting
"&gt;" before "From" is so common that some
published books still contain the occasional "&gt;From"
in the text, where the "&gt;" was inserted as authors
exchanged drafts via electronic mail.</p><p>




</blockquote>





Although electronic mail systems these days include elaborate
workarounds for such problems, so that a large binary file may be
split into small pieces and encoded on the sending side and decoded
and reassembled on the receiving side, the workarounds are cumbersome
and error prone. Also, people may want to actively look for files,
instead of waiting for someone to send them. Therefore, even when
electronic mail is available, it's useful to have a method
designed for transferring files on request.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-130" />
<a name="INDEX-131" />Furthermore,
you may not want to transfer files between machines; you may want to
have a single copy of a file but use it on multiple machines. This is
file sharing. File sharing protocols can be used as file transfer
protocols (first you share the file, then you make a local copy of
it), but they also allow you to use a file more or less as if it were
a local file. File sharing is usually more convenient than file
transfer for users, but because it provides more functionality, it is
less efficient, less robust, and less secure.</p><p>





Printing is often based on file sharing or file transfer protocols;
this makes a certain amount of sense, since you have to transfer the
data to the printer somehow.</p><p>





<a name="ch02-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.4.1. File Transfer</h3>





<a name="INDEX-132" /><a name="INDEX-133" />File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) is the Internet standard protocol for file transfers. Most web
browsers will support FTP as well as HTTP and will automatically use
FTP to access locations with names that begin "ftp:", so
many people use FTP without ever being aware of it. In theory,
allowing your users to bring in files is not an increase of risk over
allowing electronic mail; in fact, some sites offer services allowing
you to access FTP via electronic mail. FTP is also nearly
interchangeable in risk with HTTP, yet another way of bringing in
files. In practice, however, people do use FTP differently from the
way they use HTTP and electronic mail, and may bring in more files
and/or larger files.</p><p>





What makes these files undesirable? The primary worry at most sites
is that users will bring in Trojan horse software. Although this can
happen, actually the larger concern is that users will bring in
computer games, pirated software, and pornographic pictures. Although
these are not a direct security problem, they present a number of
other problems (including wasting time and disk space and introducing
legal problems of various sorts), and they are often used as carriers
for viruses. If you make sure to do the following, then you can
consider inbound FTP to be a reasonably safe service that eases
access to important Internet resources:</p><p>





<ul><li>Educate your users to appropriately mistrust any software they bring
in via FTP.</p><p></li><li>Communicate to users your site's guidelines about sexual
harassment policies and organizational resource usage.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-134" /><a name="INDEX-135" />How about
the other side of the coin: allowing other people to use FTP to
transfer files from your computers? This is somewhat riskier.
Anonymous FTP is an extremely popular mechanism for giving remote
users access to files without having to give them full access to your
machine. If you run an FTP server, you can let users retrieve files
you've placed in a separate, public area of your system without
letting them log in and potentially get access to everything on your
system. Your site's anonymous FTP area can be your
organization's public archive of papers, standards, software,
graphics images, and information of other kinds that people need from
you or that you want to share with them. FTP makes a nice complement
to HTTP, providing easier access to larger files for a wider
audience.</p><p>





To get access to the files you've made available, users log
into your system using FTP with a special login name (usually
"anonymous" or "ftp"). Most sites request
that users enter their own electronic mail address, in response to
the password prompt, as a courtesy so that the site can track who is
using the anonymous FTP server, but this requirement is rarely
enforced (mostly because there is no easy way to verify the validity
of an electronic mail address).</p><p>





In setting up an anonymous FTP server, you'll need to ensure
that people who use it can't get access to other areas or files
on the system, and that they can't use FTP to get shell-level
access to the system itself. Writable directories in the anonymous
FTP area are a special concern, as we'll see in <a href="ch17_01.html">Chapter 17, "File Transfer, File Sharing, and Printing"</a>.</p><p>





You'll also need to ensure that your users don't use the
server inappropriately. It can be very tempting for people to put up
files that they want specific people to read. Many times people
don't realize that anybody on the Internet can read them, or
they do realize this but believe in security through obscurity.
Unfortunately for these innocents, a number of tools attempt to index
anonymous FTP servers, and they succeed in removing most of the
obscurity.<a name="INDEX-136" /></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-137" /><a name="INDEX-138" />You may have
heard of other file transfer protocols. Trivial File Transport
Protocol (TFTP) is a simplified FTP protocol that diskless machines
use to transfer information. It's extremely simple so that it
can be built into hardware, and therefore supports no authentication.
There's no reason to provide TFTP access outside of your
network; ordinary users don't transfer files with TFTP.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-139" />Within
a Unix site, you may want to use <em class="emphasis">rcp</em> to transfer
files between systems. <em class="emphasis">rcp</em> (described in <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>, with the rest of the so-called
"Berkeley `r' commands") is a file transfer
program that behaves like an extended version of the Unix
<em class="emphasis">cp</em> command. It is inappropriate for use across
the Internet because it uses a trusted host authentication model.
Rather than requiring user authentication on the remote machine, it
looks at the IP address of the host the request is coming from.
Unfortunately, you can't know that packets are really coming
from that host. There is an <em class="emphasis">rcp</em> replacement
called <em class="emphasis">scp</em> that provides considerably more
security, including user authentication and encryption of the data
that passes across the network; it is also discussed in <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18, "Remote Access to Hosts"</a>, along with the <em class="emphasis">ssh</em>
command on which it is based.<a name="INDEX-140" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.4.2. File Sharing</h3>





<a name="INDEX-141" /><a name="INDEX-142" /><a name="INDEX-143" /><a name="INDEX-144" />
<a name="INDEX-145" />
<a name="INDEX-146" />Several protocols are available for file
sharing, which allow computers to use files that are physically
located on disks attached to other computers. This is highly
desirable, because it lets people use remote files without the
overhead of transferring them back and forth and trying to keep
multiple versions synchronized. However, file sharing is much more
complicated to implement than file transfer. File sharing protocols
need to provide transparency (the file appears to be local, you do
not see the file sharing occurring) and rich access (you can do all
the things to the remote file that you could do to a local file).
These features are what make file sharing desirable for users, but
the need to be transparent puts limits on the sort of security that
can be implemented, and the need to provide rich access makes the
protocols complex to implement. More complexity inevitably leads to
more vulnerability.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-147" />
<a name="INDEX-148" />
<a name="INDEX-149" />
<a name="INDEX-150" />The most commonly used
file sharing protocols are the Network File System (NFS) under Unix,
the Common Internet File System (CIFS) under Microsoft Windows, and
AppleShare on the Macintosh. CIFS is part of a family of related
protocols and has a complex heritage, involving Server Message Block
(SMB), NetBIOS/NetBEUI, and LanManager. You will see all of these
names, and some others, used to refer to file sharing protocols on
icrosoft operating systems. Although there are differences between
these protocols, sometimes with radical security implications, they
are interrelated and, for the most part, interoperable, and at the
highest level, their security implications are similar. In fact, at
the highest level, all of the file sharing protocols have similar
implications for firewalls; they are all insecure and difficult to
use across the Internet. <a name="INDEX-151" /></p><p>





NFS was designed for use in local area networks and assumes fast
response, high reliability, time synchronization, and a high degree
of trust between machines. There are some serious security problems
with NFS. If you haven't properly configured NFS (which can be
tricky), an attacker may be able to simply NFS-mount your
filesystems. The way NFS works, client machines are allowed to read
and change files stored on the server without having to log in to the
server or enter a password. Because NFS doesn't log
transactions, you might not even know that someone else has full
access to your files.</p><p>





NFS does provide a way for you to control which machines can access
your files. A file called <em class="emphasis">/etc/exports</em> lets you
specify which filesystems can be mounted and which machines can mount
them. If you leave a filesystem out of
<em class="emphasis">/etc/exports,</em> no machine can mount it. If you
put it in <em class="emphasis">/etc/exports</em>, but don't specify
what machines can mount it, you're allowing any machine to
mount it.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-152" /><a name="INDEX-153" />A number of subtler
attacks on NFS are also possible. For example, NFS has very weak
client authentication, and an attacker may be able to convince the
NFS server that a request is coming from a client that's
permitted in the <em class="emphasis">exports</em> file. There are also
situations where an attacker can hijack an existing NFS mount.</p><p>





These problems are mostly due to the fact that NFS uses host
authentication, which is easily spoofed. Because NFS doesn't
actually work well across the Internet in any case (it assumes a much
faster connection between hosts), there isn't much point in
allowing it between your site and the Internet. It creates a security
problem without adding functionality.</p><p>





CIFS and AppleShare both rely on user authentication instead of host
authentication, which is a slight improvement in security. However,
AppleShare is not capable of supporting flexible methods of user
authentication with normal clients. You are limited to using reusable
passwords, which means that attackers can simply capture passwords.
CIFS can provide good authentication and good protection in recent
versions. However, backward compatibility features in CIFS increase
its vulnerability, as it attempts to support older clients that have
much weaker security. Furthermore, CIFS actually provides an entire
family of services, some of them even more vulnerable than file
sharing. (For instance, it provides a general-purpose remote
procedure call mechanism that can be used to allow arbitrary programs
to communicate with each other.) Although it is possible for a
firewall to understand CIFS and allow only some operations through
(in order to allow CIFS file sharing but not other CIFS-based
protocols), this is quite complex, and few firewalls are capable of
it. It's also not clear how useful it would be, since file
sharing and other services are intertwined; the commands for reading
data from files and for reading data from other programs are the
same.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-154" />There are file sharing protocols designed
for use on networks like the Internet; for instance, the Andrew File
System (AFS) uses Kerberos for authentication, and optionally
encryption, and is designed to work across wide area networks,
including the Internet. NFS, CIFS, and AppleShare are all shipped as
part of popular operating systems, while AFS is a third-party
product. Because of this, and because AFS and Kerberos require
significant technical expertise to set up and maintain, AFS is not
widely used outside of a small number of large sites. If you have a
need to do secure, wide area network filesystems, it may be worth
investigating AFS, but it is not covered here.<a name="INDEX-155" /><a name="INDEX-156" /> <a name="INDEX-157" /><a name="INDEX-158" /><a name="INDEX-159" /><a name="INDEX-160" /> <a name="INDEX-161" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.4.3. Printing Systems</h3>





<a name="INDEX-162" />Almost
every operating system these days provides remote printing -- via
<em class="emphasis">lp</em> or <em class="emphasis">lpr</em> on Unix machines,
SMB printing on Windows machines, or AppleTalk print services on
acintoshes.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a> Remote printing allows a computer to print to a
printer that is physically connected to a different computer or
directly to the network. Obviously, this is highly desirable in a
local area network; you shouldn't need as many printers as you
have machines. However, all of the remote printing options are
insecure and inefficient as ways to transfer data across the
Internet. There is no reason to allow them. If you have a need to
print at a site across the Internet or to allow another site to use
your printers, it's possible to set up special mail aliases
that print the mail on receipt. This is the method many companies use
even across in-house wide area networks because it's
considerably more reliable.<a name="INDEX-163" /></p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-4" />[4]Or recombine the protocols and operating
systems in any combination you wish, as all three platforms will
support all the protocols if you install enough extra software.</p><p>
