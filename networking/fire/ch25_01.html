<a name="INDEX-2254" /></a><a name="INDEX-2255" /></a><a name="INDEX-2256" /></a>The word "policy"
makes many people flinch because it suggests impenetrable documents
put together by unknowledgeable committees, which are then promptly
ignored by everyone involved (except when they make a good excuse or
weapon). That's not the kind of policy we're discussing
in this chapter.</p><p>





The policy we're talking about here is like a nation's
foreign policy. It might be discussed in documents  --  of varying
amounts of legibility  --  but its primary purpose is to establish
a direction, a theory of what you're trying to achieve. People
sometimes confuse the words "policy",
"strategy", and "tactics". A
<em class="emphasis">policy</em> is what determines what wars you're
going to fight and why. A <em class="emphasis">strategy</em> is the plan
for carrying out the war. A <em class="emphasis">tactic</em> is a method
for carrying out a strategy. Presidents determine policy; generals
determine strategies; and anybody down to a foot soldier might
determine a tactic.</p><p>





ost of this book is about tactics. The tactics involved in building
a firewall, the nitty-gritty details of what needs to be done here,
are complex and intricate. However, no matter how good your tactics
are, if your strategy and policy are bad, you can't succeed. In
the 1800s, an American named William Walker set out to conquer
Nicaragua for the United States. His strategy and tactics were, if
not impeccable, certainly successful: he conquered Nicaragua.
Unfortunately, there was a fatal flaw in his plan. The United States
did not at the time want Nicaragua, and when he announced that he had
conquered it, the U.S. government was completely uninterested in
doing anything about it. Walker ended up ruling Nicaragua very
briefly before he was killed in a popular uprising. This was the
result of getting the strategy and the tactics right but completely
botching the policy.</p><p>




















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch25-20921" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">25.1. Your Security Policy</h2>





ost technical computer people consider a single, unified, published
security policy to be desirable in the abstract but believe  -- 
with a strong basis in personal experience  --  that attempting to
come up with one is going to be extremely painful. For example, ask
any system administrator about users and passwords, and you are
almost guaranteed to be rewarded with a rant. Everybody has a story
about the apparent insanity of people faced with passwords, one of
the simplest and most comprehensible security issues: the professor
who explained that he was too important to need a good password; the
mathematician who was told that he couldn't use a password
because it was in an English dictionary (and who replied that he
wasn't using the <em class="emphasis">English</em> word that was
spelled that way, he was using the <em class="emphasis">Russian</em> word
that was spelled that way, and nobody had told him not to use Russian
words). This kind of experience is apt to convince system
administrators that their user community is incapable of dealing
intelligently with security issues.</p><p>





Putting together a security policy undoubtedly is going to be a long,
involved process, and it's the exact opposite of the types of
tasks most technical people enjoy. If you like to program, you are
unlikely to enjoy either the meetings or the bureaucracy involved in
policy making. On the other hand, putting together a security policy
is a great deal more amusing than dealing with the side effects of
not having a policy. In the long run, you'll spend less time in
meetings arguing about security if you get it out of the way ahead of
time.</p><p>





Developing a security policy also doesn't need to be as bad as
you may be expecting. Many of the problems with security policies are
caused by people who are trying to write a security policy that
sounds like a security policy, which is to say that it's
written in big legal and technical words and says threatening things
about how users had better behave themselves. This doesn't
work. It's also the most unpleasant way to do things because it
involves hostility and incomprehension all around. It's true
that your organization may at some point need a security policy
that's written in big legal words (to satisfy some big legal
requirements). In that case, the security policy you write
shouldn't contradict the legalistic document, but the policy
you write doesn't need to be that legalistic one.</p><p>





Another problem people have in trying to write security policies is
that they have a strong feeling about what the policy ought to be,
and they're uncomfortable that the actual policy they enforce
does not meet that standard. A great deal of lip service is paid to
the notion that security should be absolute: you should have a site
that nobody could ever break into; where every user has exactly one
account, and every account has exactly one user; and where all the
passwords are excellent, and nobody ever uses anybody else's
password for anything.</p><p>





In the real world, nobody's site is like that, a fact that is
well known and well accepted. That doesn't keep people from
claiming that they want to make their site like that, sometimes in
big words on many pieces of paper that they call a "security
policy". Every time, without exception, these policies are not
followed by anybody.</p><p>





It's unlikely that your policy is one that emphasizes security
at all costs. Such a policy would be irrational. It is reasonable to
value other things highly enough to be willing to compromise
security.</p><p>





ost houses would be more secure with bars over all the windows. Few
people are willing to put bars over their windows, despite a desire
to protect themselves. People have a number of reasons for
compromising their security in this way. To start with, bars are
expensive, and they interfere with using the windows for many of
their normal purposes (e.g., seeing out of, climbing out of in an
emergency). But people are willing to go to equal expense and
inconvenience to apply other security solutions, and they may avoid
barring windows even when it's the cheapest and most convenient
solution, because it looks bad and makes them feel oppressed.</p><p>





This is entirely reasonable, and it's entirely reasonable to
make the same type of decision about your computer security. You may
not want the best security money can buy or even the best security
you can afford.</p><p>





What do you want? You want the best security that meets your
requirements for:</p><p>





<dl>
<dt><i>Affordability</i></dt>
<dd>How much money does the security cost?</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Functionality</i></dt>
<dd>Can you still use your computers?</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Cultural compatibility</i></dt>
<dd>Does it conflict with the way people at your site normally interact
with each other and the outside world?</p><p></dd>





<dt><i>Legality</i></dt>
<dd>Does it meet your site's legal requirements?</p><p></dd>

</dl>





Don't pretend that you want to be absolutely secure, if only
you could afford it. You don't live your life with the most
perfect security money could buy. For the same reasons, it's
extremely unlikely that your institution can maintain the
characteristics that are important to it if it also installs the most
perfect security money could buy. People don't like learning or
working in a hostile environment; because they won't do it,
you'll either lose the security or lose the organization.</p><p>





Sometimes a small concession to insecurity can buy a large payoff in
morale. For example, rulemakers reel at the idea of guest accounts,
but a guest account for a spouse can make a big difference in how
people feel about work. And there are sometimes unexpected results.
One university computer center was asked why its student employees
were allowed to hang around at all hours, even after the labs were
closed, doing random activities of dubious value to the computer
center; it seemed insecure at best. The answer was that several years
before, an operator who was typing his girlfriend's term paper
in a lab after hours had discovered and responded to a critical
emergency. Because he had saved the facility from what seemed likely
to be a million dollars worth of uninsured damage (insurance
companies have a nasty tendency to consider floods in windowless
third-floor computer rooms to be acts of God, and thus uninsurable),
the computer facility management figured that all the computer time
the operators wanted had already been paid for.</p><p>





On the other hand, if you have too little security, you can lose the
organization to lawyers or attackers, and what matters there is what
you do, not what you write down. Writing down marvelous policies that
don't get enforced certainly won't save you from people
who are trying to break into your computer, and it generally
won't save you from lawsuits either. The law counts only
policies that you make some attempt to enforce. If you don't do
anything, that's bad; but if you write it down, and then you
don't do it, that's worse. You've proved that you
knew you were supposed to do it.</p><p>





<a name="ch25-20958" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">25.1.1. What Should a Security Policy Contain?</h3>





First and foremost, a security policy is a way of communicating with
users and managers. It should tell them what they need to know to
make the decisions they need to make about security.</p><p>





<a name="ch25-20961" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.1. Explanations</h3>





It's important that the policy be explicit and understandable
about why certain decisions have been made. Most people will not
follow rules unless they understand why they're important. A
policy that specifies what's supposed to be done but not why is
doomed. As soon as the people who wrote it leave, or forget why they
made those decisions, it's going to stop having any effect.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-20964" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.2. Everybody's responsibilities</h3>





A policy sets explicit expectations and responsibilities among you,
your users, and your management; it lets all of you know what to
expect from each other. It's a mistake to distribute a policy
that concentrates entirely on what users need to do to make the site
secure (it seems hostile and unfair) or entirely on what system
administrators need to do (it encourages the users to believe that
somebody else will handle it, and they don't have to worry
about it).</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-20967" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.3. Regular language</h3>





ost people are not lawyers, and they're not security experts.
They're comfortable with casual descriptions. You may be afraid
to write a policy that way because it may seem uncomfortably casual
and too personal. But it's more important to make your security
policy friendly and understandable than to make it precise and
official looking. Write it as if you were explaining it to a
reasonably bright but nontechnical friend. Keep it a communication
between peers, not a memo from Mount Olympus. If that's not
acceptable in your organizational culture, write two separate policy
descriptions.</p><p>





You will not get people to comply unless they understand the document
and want to comply with it, and that means they have to at least be
willing to read it. If they shut their brains off in paragraph two
because the document sounds legal and threatening, you lose. You also
lose if they decide that you think they're stupid, or if they
decide that you don't care. Don't get so informal that
you seem condescending or sloppy. If necessary, get a technical
writer to clean up the grammar, punctuation, and spelling.</p><p>





Writing in legalese will not make a document more legally binding,
particularly if it's not written by a lawyer. Lawyers write the
way they do because they are trying to achieve very precise meanings.
Using a legal-sounding term slightly wrong just confuses the
situation; it might have its legal meaning, in which case your
document very accurately says something you didn't mean, or it
might have no meaning, in which case your document is no more
accurate than it would be if you just wrote it in casual language.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-20971" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.4. Enforcement authority</h3>





Writing down the policy is not the point; living by it is. That means
that when the policy isn't followed, something should happen to
fix the situation. Somebody needs to be responsible for making those
corrections happen, and the policy needs to specify who that's
going to be and the general range of corrections. Here are some
examples of what a security policy might specify:</p><p>





<ul><li>Managers of certain services have the authority to revoke access.</p><p></li><li>Managers of employees will be asked to take care of some kinds of
transgressions.</p><p></li><li>The people who run the corporate network may cut off facilities that
don't meet certain standards.</p><p></li></ul>
The policy should specify who is going to decide and give some
indication of what kinds of penalties are available to them. It
should not specify exactly what will happen when; it's a
policy, not a mandatory sentencing law.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-2-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.5. Provision for exceptions</h3>





No policy is perfect. You can't cover every possible future
event, and the policy will be unreadable and unusable if you even
try. Therefore, you need to specify what process will be used to make
exceptions. Is there a person with that authority? Is it a committee?
How is the reader going to make contact? How long is it going to
take?</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-20982" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.6. Provision for reviews</h3>





<a name="INDEX-2257" /></a><a name="INDEX-2258" /></a>You
can't expect to set up a policy once and forget it. The needs
of your site will change over time, and policies that were perfectly
sensible may become either too restrictive or too lax. Sometimes
change is obvious: if you work for a startup company that goes from 6
people to 6,000 people, it will probably occur to you that things are
different in important ways (but you still may not get around to
redoing the security policy if you didn't set up a mechanism
for that in advance). If you work for a 200-year old university,
however, you may not expect much change. However, even if the
organization appears to be doing its best to fossilize, the computers
change, the external networks change, and new people come in to
replace ones who leave. You still need to review and update your
policies on a regular basis.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-20991" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.1.7. Discussion of specific security issues</h3>





Because of the differences between organizations, it's hard to
be specific about issues without writing an entire book just about
security policies. However, here are some common issues to consider
when you are writing a policy:</p><p>





<ul><li>Who is allowed to have an account at your site? Do you have guest
accounts? What do you do about contractors, vendors, and clients?</p><p></li><li>Can accounts be shared among multiple people? What about a secretary
who uses an executive's account to process that person's
electronic mail? What about joint projects? What about family
members? Is it sharing an account if you let somebody else borrow a
window on your machine really quickly?</p><p></li><li>When do people lose the privilege of having an account, and what do
you do about it? What happens if people leave or are denied access?</p><p></li><li>Who can set up dial-in modems? Is it OK for other people to set up
dial-out modems? Is there anything special about PPP, SLIP, or ISDN
lines?</p><p></li><li>What do people need to do before they connect a computer to the main
network?</p><p></li><li>How secure do computers need to be before they get services from
centrally maintained machines?</p><p></li><li>How secure do computers need to be in order to connect to a network
with unprotected access to the Internet?</p><p></li><li>How is financial data going to be protected?<p></p></li><li>How is confidential information about people going to be protected?
Are other, perhaps foreign, offices covered by different laws
regarding the handling of this type of information?</p><p></li><li>What do individual users need to do to protect themselves and the
site? What kinds of passwords should they have, and when should they
change them?</p><p></li><li>What can people do on the Internet? Should they be importing random
executables and running them?</p><p></li><li>What precautions do you need to take against viruses on personal
computers?</p><p></li><li>Who can connect your site to external networks, and what's an
external network? Is it OK for a project manager to connect your site
to another specific site? What about connections to business
partners? How about other connections to the Internet?</p><p></li><li>How are home computers going to be secured? How are they going to get
secure access to your network?</p><p></li><li>How are people who are traveling going to get access to the network?<p></p></li><li>What are the requirements for systems performing electronic commerce?<p></p></li><li><p>What information is considered company confidential? How is it going
to be protected? Can it be sent outside the site via electronic mail?</p><p></li><li>If you have remote sites, how are they going to get secure access to
your main network?</p><p></li></ul>
</div>
</div>
















<a name="ch25-21034" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">25.1.2. What Should a Security Policy Not Contain?</h3>





Some pieces of information don't belong in your site's
security policy, as we discuss in this section.</p><p>





<a name="ch25-21037" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.2.1. Technical details</h3>





The security policy needs to describe what you're trying to
protect and why; it doesn't necessarily need to describe the
details of how. It's much more useful to have a 1-page document
that describes <em class="emphasis">what</em> and <em class="emphasis">why</em>
in terms that everyone in your organization can understand than a
100-page document that describes <em class="emphasis">how,</em> but that
nobody except your most senior technical staff can understand.</p><p>





For example, consider a policy that includes a requirement that says:</p><p>






Nonreusable passwords shall be used to authenticate all incoming
connections from the outside world, in order to prevent potential
attackers from being able to capture reusable passwords by monitoring
such connections.</p><p>






This requirement is much more useful than a policy that says:</p><p>






OTP<a href="#FOOTNOTE-183">[183]</a> will be used for all
incoming connections.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-183" /></a>[183]OTP is the IETF standard for one-time passwords.
It is based upon S/Key.</p><p>




</blockquote>






Why? Because the first policy describes <em class="emphasis">what</em> is
to be protected and <em class="emphasis">why</em>, and it leaves
<em class="emphasis">how</em> open so the technical staff can select the
best implementation.</p><p>





 A policy that says the following is better yet:</p><p>






Regular passwords are often stolen and reused when they pass across
networks. We won't use passwords that can be reused across
networks our company doesn't control.</p><p>






This policy communicates the same information without the legal-style
language. It also clarifies some other points. For example, in the
original language does the "outside world" include
companies that have special relationships with yours? It may seem
obvious to you that it does, but it probably doesn't seem
obvious to the managers who are arranging to work with those
companies. The reworded language makes it clear what the criterion is
(although you may still end up arguing about what networks meet it).</p><p>





Policy can guide you in selecting and implementing technology, but it
shouldn't be used to specify it. It's often much easier
to get management to buy into, and sign off on, an overall policy
than on a specific technology.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-21055" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.2.2. Somebody else's problems</h3>





Every site's security policy is different. Different sites have
different concerns, different constraints, different users, and
different capabilities; all of these lead to different policies.
Further, a site's policy may change over time, as the site
grows and changes. Don't assume that you need to do things the
way they've always been done, or that you can borrow somebody
else's policy and simply change the names in it.</p><p>
</div>









<a name="ch25-3-fm2xml" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.1.2.3. Problems that aren't computer security problems</h3>





People displaying obscene pictures on their computer screens
aren't a computer security problem; they're a human
resources problem (and a legal problem, if somebody decides to sue
for harassment). People playing computer games all day aren't a
computer security problem, either; they're a management
problem. These issues should be adequately covered by existing
policies. If they aren't, you have problems far too large to
try to handle with a computer security policy. If they are, trying to
cover them again risks setting up a conflict between the two
policies. Furthermore, computer security policies cover enough
complex and emotional territory without adding yet more.</p><p>
