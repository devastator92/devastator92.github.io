<h2 class="sect1">17.3. Network File System (NFS)</h2>





<a name="INDEX-1657" /><a name="INDEX-1658" />
<a name="INDEX-1659" />The NFS protocol is designed to allow
systems to access files across the network on a remote system, as
conveniently as if the files were on directly attached disks. The NFS
protocol itself was designed to be <em class="emphasis">stateless</em> for
both server implementation simplicity and robustness. A stateless
protocol is one where each transaction is handled separately; the
server doesn't need to keep information about what clients have
done previously. Being stateless allows an NFS server to reboot while
clients are making requests and, once it returns to service, continue
serving files to clients as if nothing had happened.</p><p>





This may seem like a fairly simple concept, but it's quite
difficult to make a protocol stateless when it deals with file
access. A number of important features of most filesystems are
inherently based on state. For instance, being able to maintain file
locking requires keeping track of what process has locked the file.
This design decision has had a major impact on security and the
proliferation of system administrator jokes based upon the kernel
message "NFS server not responding".</p><p>





achines may be NFS servers (exporting their disks for access by
other machines), NFS clients (accessing disks exported by NFS
servers), or both. Almost every Unix implementation uses NFS as the
primary way to share files, and NFS client applications are available
for most other popular operating systems. (NFS server applications
for non-Unix machines are more rare.)</p><p>





Two versions of NFS are currently in widespread use. NFS version 2 is
the protocol people are usually referring to when they just mention
the term <em class="emphasis">NFS</em>. It is usually run over UDP
(although the specification allows the use of TCP, most
implementations do not implement it). NFS version 3, frequently
written as <em class="emphasis">NFSv3</em>, is a newer version with
several improvements, including support for larger files, and almost
every implementation allows it to be run over TCP as well as UDP.
From a security standpoint, there is little to distinguish between
the two versions, so we use the term <em class="emphasis">NFS</em> to
apply to both versions unless otherwise noted.</p><p>





The NFS protocol itself is quite a straightforward RPC protocol, and
all implementations and versions use a fixed port number (normally
port 2049). A fixed port number is used so that an NFS client does
not have to perform a portmapper query when a NFS server is
restarted. However, in order to operate correctly, NFS relies upon a
number of other services for initially mounting the filesystem, for
file locking and for recovery after a system crash. These additional
services are also based upon RPC but do not always use the same port
numbers. This means that portmapper requests are needed to locate the
services. For more information about RPC see <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





Some vendors also support a version of NFS based on Secure RPC, which
addresses many of the problems with authentication, providing better
authentication both of the client machine and of the user. Secure RPC
has several problems that also apply to NFS implemented on top of it:</p><p>





<ul><li>It is not widely supported; it is available almost exclusively on
Suns.</p><p></li><li>The process of exchanging keys between machines is difficult.</p></li><li>It doesn't perform as well as standard RPC. (NFS is
particularly performance-sensitive.)</p><p></li><li>The sizes of the public keys are too small.</p></li></ul>
Secure RPC is discussed further in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a>.</p><p>





<a name="ch17-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.3.1. NFS Authentication</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1660" />NFS was originally
designed to be used within local networks for file sharing, and
although it can be tuned to work over a network that has delays, it
is unsafe to allow across a firewall for various reasons. NFS's
main security problems are:</p><p>





<ul><li>The NFS server relies on the IP address to authenticate client hosts,
making it vulnerable to address forgery.</p><p></li><li>The NFS server relies on the client to authenticate the user, making
it vulnerable to any user who has compromised a client machine.</p><p></li><li>The NFS server doesn't recheck the client authentication on
every request. The server assumes that if the client uses a valid
file handle, the client is authorized to access that filesystem. An
attacker with a forged or captured file handle can access the
filesystem just as easily as a legitimate client can.</p><p></li></ul>
The primary problem with NFS is its weak authentication of requests.
Access to a given NFS-exported filesystem is all or nothing; either a
given client machine is trusted to access the filesystem, or it
isn't. If the server trusts a given client machine, the server
believes whatever the client tells it about who is trying to access
which files. It then uses that information for authorization
according to the standard Unix file protection mechanisms (i.e.,
user, group, and other permissions).</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1661" />The server's
trust in the client is established when the client mounts the
filesystem from the server. To mount a filesystem a client sends a
mount request containing the name of the filesystem to the
<em class="emphasis">mountd</em> RPC service on the server and asks for
permission to mount it. The <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> service
checks whether or not the client is allowed to access that
filesystem, using the source IP address of the request to identify
the client. If the access is allowable, the
<em class="emphasis">mountd</em> service gives the client a <em class="emphasis">file
handle</em> (basically a magic set of credentials for the
client), which the client then uses for all access to the filesystem.</p><p>





Once the client has mounted the filesystem (and received a file
handle from the server), the client sends a request using the NFS
protocol to the server each time it wants to act on a file on that
filesystem. The request describes the action the client wants to take
and includes the file handle obtained from the server, so the server
assumes that the client is authorized to request that action. Some
NFS servers will log error messages when requests are received with
invalid file handles, but many of them simply ignore them, which
helps attackers who are trying to guess file handles. If you have the
choice, choose an NFS server that will log requests with invalid file
handles (this may not be the default configuration even on servers
which support logging; check to make certain that you not only have
the capability, but have actually enabled it).</p><p>





This system has at least three problems. First, there are
difficulties with the initial authentication. In addition to the
usual problems with using forgeable source IP addresses for
authentication, there is another way for attackers to authenticate
illicitly. The RPC port location service offers a forwarding service
where a client can send a request to a service via the location
server. This request will show up to <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> as
if it had been issued by the location service, which is running on
the server. If <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> permits the server to
mount its own filesystems, then an attacker can send a mount request
using the forwarding feature in order to obtain a valid file handle.
To deal with this, either the server should deny itself access, or
the forwarding feature of the port location service should be
disabled (and the best option is to do both).</p><p>





The second problem with <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> authentication
has to do with the use of the file handle as an authentication token.
If an attacker can determine a valid file handle without help from
<em class="emphasis">mountd</em>, the attacker can then use it without
further authentication. Simply guessing randomly isn't going to
work; NFS version 2 uses 32-byte file handles, and NFS version 3 uses
variable-length file handles up to 64 bytes long. But attackers
don't have to guess randomly because NFS implementations
typically impose a structure to the file handles. Only a component of
the file handle data is random, and that's the only part the
attacker has to guess. Implementations vary on how much random data
there is; early implementations are particularly bad about it, using
file handles that are based on the time the filesystem was created,
which is often easy to guess.</p><p>





odern implementations of NFS have addressed this problem, and
patches are available for many older implementations. If you run NFS
on a system where security is important, you should consult your
vendor's documentation to make sure that you have an NFS server
with reasonable randomness in the file handle generation, and that
you have followed any special instructions for setting up filesystems
(some file handle generation schemes require special initialization
for filesystems to ensure unguessable file handles).</p><p>





The third problem with file handles is that they're difficult
to get rid of. An NFS server is required to be stateless; all it can
do is look at a file handle and determine whether or not that file
handle is any good. On most implementations, once a client has a file
handle, the only way to keep the client from using it is to change
the method for generating file handles so that all previous file
handles are invalid, requiring every client to remount the filesystem
and probably generating mass trauma.</p><p>





Well-behaved clients don't save file handles and will contact
<em class="emphasis">mountd</em> for a new file handle each time they
mount a filesystem. This still means that a well-behaved client that
already has a filesystem mounted can continue to use it if you change
its access permissions, but it does give you some measure of control.
Eventually, the client will have to remount the filesystem (and you
may be able to force it to do so if you have some sort of access to
it). Nothing requires an attacker to be this well behaved; a hostile
client can simply save the file handle and reuse it without requiring
<em class="emphasis">mountd</em> 's assistance. In general, the only
way to change the validity of file handles and prevent this is to
change the filesystem on the server (for instance, by changing where
it is mounted on the server). Vendor documentation will usually tell
you what operations change file handles (mostly to prevent you from
accidentally changing file handles and interrupting operations on
clients).<a name="INDEX-1662" /></p><p>

<a name="ch17-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.3.2. NFS and root</h3>





Under NFS, root may be treated differently from normal users. Some
Unix NFS servers always treat root the same way they treat normal
users: the client's root user gets the same access that the
server's root user would have. Some of them always translate
the client's root user to a UID known as "nobody"
that is never used as a regular user; thus, this user will have only
the permissions granted to the world. This "nobody" UID
may be either the highest possible UID or a UID that translates to -1
(which might be written as -1, or as the highest possible UID plus
1). Just for additional complication, "nobody" is
sometimes -2 instead of -1, and for some unknown reason, System V
release 4 defines the highest possible UID as 60,000. On some Unix
machines, more than one of these numbers (-1, -2, 60000, 60001,
65535, and 65536) are listed in the password file as
"nobody". Most Unix NFS servers allow you to choose
whether you wish to allow root access or translate it to
"nobody" via an option in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/exports</em> file. Non-Unix servers normally
treat root as if it were any other user, but because that user is
unlikely to have special privileges on the server, it isn't a
problem.</p><p>





Translating root to "nobody" is an extremely minor
security improvement. Anybody who is capable of being root on the
client is capable of pretending to be any user whatsoever on the
client, and can therefore see and do anything any user can do. The
translation hides only those files on the server restricted to access
by root itself. You will still probably want to use translation
wherever you can for the minimal protection it does give you, but you
should not feel that it makes it safe to export filesystems to
possibly hostile clients.</p><p>





Better protection for the server is available by exporting the
filesystem read-only. If the filesystem is exported purely read-only
(no host is allowed to write it) you can be reasonably certain the
data cannot be modified via NFS. If you allow any host to write it,
you're vulnerable to forgery.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch17-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.3.3. NFS Client Vulnerabilities</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1663" />
<a name="INDEX-1664" />NFS clients
may also be in danger from NFS servers. For example, an NFS-mounted
filesystem may contain <em class="emphasis">setuid</em> programs; users on
the client would be able to use those programs to become root. Device
entries on an NFS-mounted partition are considered to apply to the
client's devices, not the server's devices. Somebody with
an account on an NFS client and root permission on an NFS server can
use this to get unlimited, if inconvenient, read-write access to all
data on the client.</p><p>





Some NFS clients provide options to <em class="emphasis">mount</em> that
can be used to disable devices and <em class="emphasis">setuid/setgid</em>
on mounted filesystems. If <em class="emphasis">mount</em> is not
available to users other than root, or if it always uses these
options for users other than root, this will protect the client from
the server. If these options are not available, even if only root can
mount filesystems, you should consider mounting an NFS filesystem to
be equivalent to granting the server machine root access to the
client.</p><p>





NFS clients may also be vulnerable to less obvious forms of attack
from NFS servers. Mounting a filesystem is a privileged operation, so
NFS clients run as root. A hostile server may be able to exploit
buffer overflow errors in the NFS client, causing it to run arbitrary
programs. In general, this is not transparent to the user (it
interferes with the ability to use whatever filesystem the client was
trying to get to), and it requires an attacker with a high level of
control over the server machine. In traditional fixed NFS server
environments, it's not a major threat. On the other hand, the
use of automounters, which are discussed in a later section, can make
it an effective attack.</p><p>
</div>
















<a name="ch17-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.3.4. File Locking with NFS</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1665" /> <a name="INDEX-1666" /> <a name="INDEX-1667" />File locking allows one process to
prevent other processes from accessing a file in specific ways. It is
most often used to keep multiple processes from writing overlapping
changes to a file, but it can also be used for other reasons (for
instance, it may be advisable to keep other processes from even
reading a file while it is being changed). NFS provides a voluntary
file-locking mechanism. By default, there are no locks associated
with a file, and any process can do anything with it. A process that
wants a lock must explicitly ask for it.</p><p>





File locks are a form of state; when you request a lock on a file,
you change the state of the file, and that state has to be kept track
of both by the server (so that it can enforce the lock) and the
client (so that it can release the lock when it is no longer needed).
This is problematic for NFS because it's a stateless protocol.</p><p>





There are therefore two parts to the problem of implementing locking
in NFS. First, you have to add the ability to keep any kind of state
across server and client restarts, and then you have to track the
locks themselves.</p><p>





It's easy enough for any program to keep state internally;
it's not even all that difficult for a server to save that
state so that when the server restarts, it can pick up where it left
off. However, that's not good enough for NFS locking because
the state that is important also includes the programs that had
requested the locks, and NFS clients will almost never regain this
state when they restart. If a machine crashes while you are in the
middle of editing a file, the editor is unlikely to resume where it
left off. If the editor had a lock on the file you were editing,
something needs to free that lock so that you can restart your
editing session. If the editor itself crashes, this task is handled
by other programs on the machine. If the entire machine crashes,
however, there has to be some other mechanism that will handle the
situation.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1668" />The problem of dealing
with restarts is solved using an ancillary protocol called
<em class="emphasis">statd</em>, which is responsible for tracking and
reporting restarts on behalf of other protocols.
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> handles two types of requests: programs on
the local machine can ask <em class="emphasis">statd</em> to notify them
when specific remote machines restart, and remote machines can ask
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> to notify them when the local machine
restarts. It's also possible to cancel these requests, and when
things shut down cleanly, they will cancel all outstanding requests.
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> keeps track of requests in files, so that
its state is preserved across restarts. <em class="emphasis">statd</em> is
voluntary in that it relies on the remote systems to honor requests
for notification when they restart -- for scalability reasons
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> does not poll for status. When
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> starts, it checks its files and notifies
all remote machines that have requested notification.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">statd</em> is built on top of RPC and uses UDP. It is
particularly problematic for firewalls because it involves traffic
initiated by the server. NFS clients will request restart
notification from NFS servers. The original request for notification
will go from the client to the server, but if the server reboots, the
notification will come from the server to the client and will not
normally be permitted.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1669" />Locking itself is
implemented using <em class="emphasis">lockd. lockd</em> in turn<em class="emphasis">
</em>relies heavily on <em class="emphasis">statd</em> to
reestablish locking after a restart as it does not store any
persistent state. When a client wishes to lock a file on an NFS
filesystem, it contacts the remote <em class="emphasis">lockd</em> in
order to lock the file and requests its own
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> to monitor the server. When both the
<em class="emphasis">lockd</em> and <em class="emphasis">statd</em> response
are received, the client assumes that the file is locked. When it
receives the <em class="emphasis">lockd</em> request, the server asks the
server <em class="emphasis">statd</em> to monitor the client. At this
point, one of the following can occur:</p><p>





<ul><li>The client releases the lock.</p><p></li><li>The server restarts.</p></li><li><p>The client restarts.</p></li></ul>
When the client releases the lock, the client sends an unlock request
to the server <em class="emphasis">lockd</em>.</p><p>





After a server restart, the server <em class="emphasis">statd</em>
notifies all remote clients using locking of the event, which causes
them to resubmit all lock requests. This can have unexpected results
if more than one client was attempting to lock the same file. After a
server restart, you can lose a lock. If the purpose of the lock was
to prevent another system from making changes while a critical update
was occurring, then this will usually result in loss of data or file
corruption. More correct locking semantics would suggest that the
original client should regain the lock so that it could proceed with
the critical update. This is one reason why NFS file locking cannot
be relied upon.</p><p>





After a client restart, <em class="emphasis">statd</em> notifies all
servers of the event. This causes them to immediately release any
locks the client may have been holding before the restart. If the
purpose of the lock was to prevent another system from making changes
while a critical update was occurring, then this will usually result
in loss of data or file corruption. More correct locking semantics
would leave the file locked so that a cleanup process could check the
consistency of the file before allowing another client to make
changes. This is another reason why NFS file locking cannot be relied
upon.</p><p>





<em class="emphasis">lockd,</em> like <em class="emphasis">statd</em>, is built
on top of RPC and uses UDP, which makes it extremely difficult to
safely pass through a firewall. Some stateful and proxy firewall
systems can handle RPC, and so it may be possible to use NFS file
locking across this type of firewall. You will need to be very
careful; some systems will allow everything but the server-to-client
restart notifications, in which case locking will appear to work, but
lock consistency will be lost as soon as the server restarts. If file
locking is not needed, then it is possible to run some systems
without either <em class="emphasis">statd</em> or
<em class="emphasis">lockd</em>. However, any application programs that
try to use file locking on NFS filesystems are likely to fail in bad
ways that are likely to involve loss or corruption of data (which
presumably would not occur in the unlikely event that
<em class="emphasis">lockd</em> and <em class="emphasis">statd</em> were
working correctly).<a name="INDEX-1670" /> <a name="INDEX-1671" /> <a name="INDEX-1672" /></p><p>

<a name="ch17-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.3.5. Automounting</h3>





<a name="INDEX-1673" />
<a name="INDEX-1674" />Originally, NFS filesystems were
mounted by machines at boot time, which has some significant
disadvantages. It means that at boot time, a machine has to decide
what server it's going to get particular files from, and the
only way to change that decision is to reboot. It also has to mount
all the filesystems it might ever need. On a multi-user system, where
different users want different files, this results in a lot of wasted
communication as machines mount filesystems that they don't
actually need. It can also result in major annoyances as machines
wait around for crashed file servers, sometimes pointlessly.</p><p>





The solution to this problem is to use an
<em class="filename">automounter</em>, a program that mounts filesystems
when there is some reason to and unmounts them when they are no
longer in use. Most automounters will also allow you to configure
things so that a given filesystem is available on multiple machines,
and clients use the most appropriate copy.</p><p>





Intuitively, automounters seem as if they ought to be free from
network vulnerabilities. After all, they provide services only to the
local host. They ought to have only the vulnerabilities that other
NFS clients have, and those are relatively minimal.</p><p>





Unfortunately, this is not the case. Automounters have two additional
kinds of vulnerabilities. First, and most obviously, automounters
often use other services to get lists of NFS servers. (For instance,
many of them will use NIS maps for this purpose.) They will have all
the vulnerabilities associated with those services, and if those
services are insecure, it may be easy for an attacker to direct an
automounter system to a hostile server. It may also be possible to
attack the automounter directly with the information about which
servers to use; for instance, if the automounter itself has buffer
overflow problems, feeding it an overlength server name may give an
attacker the ability to run arbitrary commands.</p><p>





The more major source of vulnerabilities comes from the way
automounters are implemented. For technical reasons, the most
effective way for an automounter to work is for it to claim to be an
NFS server. Client programs that want to access filesystems speak to
this fake server, which then acts as a client to the genuine servers.
This fake server needs to accept requests only from clients on the
local machine, but the fact that it is an NFS server opens it up to a
number of attacks. For instance, the attack that depends on
forwarding requests through the port location service is particularly
effective against automounters, which must accept local requests.</p><p>





If you are using an automounter on a client, you should be aware that
it could be vulnerable to NFS server, RPC server, and other network
application vulnerabilities.<a name="INDEX-1675" /> <a name="INDEX-1676" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.3.6. Packet Filtering Characteristics of NFS</h3>





NFS is an RPC-based service. As mentioned in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>, it's very difficult to handle RPC-based
services with a packet filtering system because the servers normally
don't use predictable port numbers. NFS is an exception to this
rule, however. Although it is RPC-based, it uses port 2049 reliably,
and as of NFS3, this standard is official.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-72">[72]</a> In order to attempt to enforce some
minor amount of authentication, many but not all implementations of
NFS use privileged ports as client source ports.</p><p><blockquote class="footnote">




<a name="FOOTNOTE-72" />[72]Ironically, the version 2 protocol incorrectly predicts that
while 2049 is an unofficial standard, "later versions of the
protocol use the `Portmapping' facility of RPC".
Later versions of the protocol in fact just made 2049
official.</p><p>




</blockquote>





NFS is provided over both TCP and UDP. Some clients and servers
prefer TCP, and others prefer UDP. TCP-based NFS is relatively new,
and not all clients or servers support it. Those that do often behave
differently over TCP than over UDP. If a particular client-server
combination behaves badly over one protocol, try it over the other.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-1677" />
<a name="INDEX-1678" />In order to make use
of NFS across a firewall, you will also need to make the portmapper
and <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> available; the portmapper is at port
111. <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> is an RPC protocol at a randomly
chosen port number managed by the portmapper. As discussed earlier,
you may need <em class="emphasis">lockd</em> and
<em class="emphasis">statd</em> as well, and in that case, you will need
to allow <em class="emphasis">statd</em> in both directions.
<em class="emphasis">lockd</em> and <em class="emphasis">statd</em> are also
RPC protocols at randomly chosen port numbers managed by the
portmapper. See <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Intermediary Protocols"</a> for more information
about packet filtering and RPC.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.3.7. Proxying Characteristics of NFS</h3>





RPC-based protocols are almost as unpleasant to proxy as they are to
allow with packet filtering; they cannot be handled adequately with
generic proxies. NFS is particularly difficult, because of the large
number of protocols involved and the server-initiated transactions
that are required to support locking. Some RPC-knowledgeable
transparent proxy systems do support NFS, but it would be unwise to
use them for critical or high-volume applications. NFS is
particularly problematic for proxying because it is data-intense,
exchanging large volumes of data in situations where delay is very
noticeable to the user. A host doing NFS proxying is going to need to
deal with multiple connections transferring large packets at high
speeds.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.3.8. Network Address Translation Characteristics of NFS</h3>





Although the NFS protocol itself does not contain embedded IP
addresses and could function with address translation, you will have
problems with <em class="emphasis">mountd</em> as it uses IP addresses for
authentication. Some implementations of NFS use a
<em class="emphasis">mountd</em> that issues different NFS file handles
for each client, and the NFS server checks both the IP address and
file handle for consistency; this is likely to fail if you are using
address translation. If you have to run NFS through a translation
system, use TCP to reduce the load on the translation system as far
as possible.<a name="INDEX-1679" /></p><p>
