<h2 class="sect1">2.7. Naming and Directory Services</h2>





<a name="INDEX-191" />A naming service
translates between the names that people use and the numerical
addresses that machines use. Different protocols use different naming
services; the primary protocol used on the Internet is the Domain
Name System (DNS), which converts between hostnames and IP
addresses.<a name="INDEX-192" /> <a name="INDEX-193" /></p><p>





In the early days of the Internet, it was possible for every site to
maintain a host table that listed the name and number for every
machine on the Internet that it might ever care about. With millions
of hosts attached, it isn't practical for any single site to
maintain a list of them, much less for every site to do so. Instead,
DNS allows each site to maintain information about its own hosts and
to find the information for other sites. DNS isn't a user-level
service, per se, but it underlies SMTP, FTP, Telnet, and virtually
every other service users need, because users want to be able to type
"telnet fictional.example" rather than "telnet
10.100.242.32". Furthermore, many anonymous FTP servers will
not allow connections from clients unless they can use DNS to look up
the client host's name, so that it can be logged.</p><p>





The net result is that you must both use and provide name service in
order to participate in the Internet. The main risk in providing DNS
service is that you may give away more information than you intend.
For example, DNS lets you include information about what hardware and
software you're running, information that you don't want
an attacker to have. In fact, you may not even want an attacker to
know the names of all your internal machines. <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20, "Naming and Directory Services"</a>, discusses how to configure name service in
order to make full information available to your internal hosts, but
only partial information to external inquirers.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-194" />Using DNS internally and then relying on
hostnames for authentication makes you vulnerable to an intruder who
can install a deceitful DNS server. This can be handled by a
combination of methods, including:</p><p>





<ul><li>Using IP addresses (rather than hostnames) for authentication on
services that need to be more secure.</p><p></li><li>Authenticating users instead of hosts on the most secure services,
because IP addresses can also be spoofed.</p><p></li></ul>
<a name="INDEX-195" /> <a name="INDEX-196" />Windows 2000 networks use DNS in
conjunction with the Active Directory service to locate resources.
Clients access the Active Directory service via the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is a widely used standard for
access to directory information.<a name="INDEX-197" />
<a name="INDEX-198" /></p><p>





<a name="INDEX-199" /> <a name="INDEX-200" />Older Microsoft
Windows networks use Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) to map
NetBIOS hostnames to IP addresses. The name is unintentionally
misleading; WINS is not an Internet name service (one intended to
function on the worldwide Internet) but an internet name service (one
intended to function on an internet, a collection of local area
networks). The service that WINS extends, NetBIOS name service,
functions only on a single local area network. Popular terminology
has changed since the service was named, and now it might more
appropriately be called Windows Intranet Name Service.</p><p>





As WINS has evolved, the interrelationship between it and DNS has
become ever more complex and confusing. WINS servers can consult DNS
servers, and Microsoft DNS servers can consult WINS servers. The
important things to remember about WINS are:</p><p>





<ul><li>WINS is designed as a purely internal protocol for a single
organization.</p><p></li><li>There are scaling issues using WINS on large and complex networks,
even for a single organization.</p><p></li><li>Microsoft is phasing out use of WINS in favor of DNS.</p></li><li>WINS is less secure than DNS.</p></li></ul>
WINS has all the security issues that DNS has, and then some. First,
WINS contains more information than DNS does. While DNS contains
information, like hostnames, that you might not want an attacker to
have, WINS contains information, like valid usernames and lists of
running services, that you definitely don't want an attacker to
have. Second, WINS is designed around dynamic registration; not only
does it accept queries from hosts, it accepts new data from the
network. This makes it much more vulnerable than DNS to hostile
clients. Making WINS visible to the Internet is highly dangerous and
not at all useful.</p><p>





<a name="INDEX-201" /><a name="INDEX-202" /><a name="INDEX-203" />Some sites use Sun's
Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages
(YP) to distribute hostname information internally. It is not
necessary to do this. You can use DNS clients instead on any platform
that supports NIS, but NIS may be more convenient for configuring
your internal machines. It is certainly neither necessary nor
advisable to provide NIS service to external machines. NIS is
designed to administer a single site, not to exchange information
between sites, and it is highly insecure. For example, it would not
be possible to provide your host information to external sites via
NIS without also providing your password file, if both are available
internally.<a name="INDEX-204" /></p><p>
