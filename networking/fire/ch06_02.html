<h2 class="sect1">6.2. Screened Host Architectures</h2>





<a name="INDEX-402" />
<a name="INDEX-403" /><a name="INDEX-404" />Whereas a dual-homed host
architecture provides services from a host that's attached to
multiple networks (but has routing turned off), a <em class="emphasis">screened
host architecture</em> provides services from a host
that's attached to only the internal network, using a separate
router. In this architecture, the primary security is provided by
packet filtering. (For example, packet filtering is what prevents
people from going around proxy servers to make direct connections.)</p><p>





<a href="ch06_02.html#ch06-1890">Figure 6-3</a> shows a simple version of a screened host
architecture. The bastion host sits on the internal network. The
packet filtering on the screening router is set up in such a way that
the bastion host is the only system on the internal network that
hosts on the Internet can open connections to (for example, to
deliver incoming email). Even then, only certain types of connections
are allowed. Any external system trying to access internal systems or
services will have to connect to this host. The bastion host thus
needs to maintain a high level of host security.</p><p>

Packet filtering also permits the bastion host to open allowable
connections (what is "allowable" will be determined by
your site's particular security policy) to the outside world.
The <a href="ch06_03.html#ch06-1947">Section 6.3.2, "Bastion Host"</a> in the <a href="ch06_03.html#ch06-1910">Section 6.3, "Screened Subnet Architectures"</a> discussion, later in this chapter,
contains more information about the functions of bastion hosts, and
<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Bastion Hosts"</a>, describes in detail how to build one.</p><p>





The packet filtering configuration in the screening router may do one
of the following:</p><p>





<ul><li>Allow other internal hosts to open connections to hosts on the
Internet for certain services (allowing those services via packet
filtering, as discussed in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Packet Filtering"</a>)</p><p></li><li>Disallow all connections from internal hosts (forcing those hosts to
use proxy services via the bastion host, as discussed in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Proxy Systems"</a>)</p><p></li></ul>
You can mix and match these approaches for different services; some
may be allowed directly via packet filtering, while others may be
allowed only indirectly via proxy. It all depends on the particular
policy your site is trying to enforce.</p><p>





Because this architecture allows packets to move from the Internet to
the internal networks, it may seem more risky than a dual-homed host
architecture, which is designed so that no external packet can reach
the internal network. In practice, however, the dual-homed host
architecture is also prone to failures that let packets actually
cross from the external network to the internal network. (Because
this type of failure is completely unexpected, there are unlikely to
be protections against attacks of this kind.) Furthermore, it's
easier to defend a router than it is to defend a host. For most
purposes, the screened host architecture provides both better
security and better usability than the dual-homed host architecture.</p><p>





Compared to other architectures, however, such as the screened subnet
architecture, there are some disadvantages to the screened host
architecture. The major one is that if an attacker manages to break
in to the bastion host, nothing is left in the way of network
security between the bastion host and the rest of the internal hosts.
The router also presents a single point of failure; if the router is
compromised, the entire network is available to an attacker. For this
reason, the screened subnet architecture, discussed next, has become
increasingly popular.<a name="INDEX-405" /><a name="INDEX-406" /></p><p>





Because the bastion host is a single point of failure, it is
inappropriate to run high-risk services like web servers on it. You
need to provide the same level of protection to it that you would
provide to a dual-homed host that was the sole firewall for your
site.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">6.2.1. Appropriate Uses</h3>





A screened host architecture is appropriate when:</p><p>





<ul><li>Few connections are coming from the Internet (in particular, it is
<em class="emphasis">not</em> an appropriate architecture if the screened
host is a public web server).</p><p></li><li>The network being protected has a relatively high level of host
security.</p><p></li></ul>
