<h2 class="sect1">16.6. Additional Resource Records</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2413" />There are
a number of resource records that we haven't covered yet in
this book. The first of these, HINFO, has been around since the
beginning but hasn't been widely used. The others were defined
in <a name="INDEX-2414" />RFC 1183 and
several successive RFCs. Most are experimental, but some are on the
standards track and are coming into more prevalent use. We'll
describe them here to give you a little head start in getting used to
them.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.6.1. Host Information</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2415" />HINFO stands
for Host INFOrmation. The record-specific data is a pair of strings
identifying the host's hardware type and operating system. The
strings are supposed to come from the MACHINE NAMES and OPERATING
SYSTEM NAMES listed in the "Assigned Numbers" RFC
(currently RFC 1700), but this requirement is not enforced; you can
use your own abbreviations. The RFC isn't at all comprehensive,
so it's quite possible you won't find your system in the
list anyway. Originally, host information records were intended to
let services like FTP determine how to interact with a remote system.
This would have made it possible to negotiate datatype
transformations automatically, for example. Unfortunately, this
didn't happen -- few sites supply accurate HINFO values for
all their systems. Some network administrators use HINFO records to
help them keep track of machine types instead of recording the
machine types in a database or a notebook. Here are two examples of
HINFO records; note that the hardware type and operating system
fields must be surrounded with quotes if they include any whitespace:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">;
; These machine names and system names did not come from RFC 1700
;
wormhole  IN  HINFO  ACME-HW  ACME-GW
cujo      IN  HINFO  "Watch Dog Hardware"  "Rabid OS"</pre></blockquote>


Before you go adding them to your zone -- particularly a zone
visible from the Internet -- you should know that HINFO records
can present a security risk. By providing easily accessible
information about a system, you may be making it easier for a hacker
to break into it.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.6.2. AFSDB</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2416" />AFSDB has a
syntax like that of the MX record, and semantics a bit like that of
the NS record. An AFSDB record gives either the location of an
<a name="INDEX-2417" />
<a name="INDEX-2418" />AFS
cell database server or of a DCE cell's authenticated name
server. The type of server the record points to and the name of the
host running the server are contained in the record-specific data
portion of the record.</p><p>


So what's an AFS cell database server? Or AFS, for that matter?
AFS originally stood for the Andrew File System, designed by the good
folks at Carnegie-Mellon University as part of the Andrew Project.
(It's now an IBM product.) AFS is a network filesystem, like
NFS, but one that handles the latency of wide area networks much
better than NFS does and provides local caching of files to enhance
performance. An AFS cell database server runs the process responsible
for tracking the location of filesets (groups of files) on various
AFS fileservers within a cell (a logical group of hosts). So being
able to find the AFS cell database server is the key to finding any
file in the cell.</p><p>


And what's an <a name="INDEX-2419" /> <a name="INDEX-2420" />authenticated
name server? It holds location information about all sorts of
services available within a DCE cell. A DCE cell? That's a
logical group of hosts that share services offered by The Open
Group's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).</p><p>


And now, back to our story. To access another cell's AFS or DCE
services across a network, you must first find out where that
cell's cell database servers or authenticated name servers are.
Hence the new record type. The domain name the record is attached to
gives the name of the cell the server knows about. Cells often share
names with DNS domains, so this usually doesn't look at all
odd.</p><p>


As we said, the AFSDB record's syntax is like the MX
record's syntax. In place of the preference value, you specify
the number 1 for an AFS cell database server or 2 for a DCE
authenticated name server.</p><p>


In place of the mail exchanger host, you specify the name of the host
running the server. Simple!</p><p>


Say an <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em> systems
administrator sets up a DCE cell (which includes AFS services)
because she wants to experiment with distributed processing to speed
up graphics rendering. She runs both an AFS cell database server and
a DCE name server on <em class="emphasis">bladerunner.fx.movie.edu</em>, another cell
database server on <em class="emphasis">empire.fx.movie.edu</em>, and another DCE
name server on <em class="emphasis">aliens.fx.movie.edu</em>. She should set up
the AFSDB records as follows:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">; Our DCE cell is called fx.movie.edu, same as the domain name of the zone
fx.movie.edu.  IN  AFSDB  1 bladerunner.fx.movie.edu.
               IN  AFSDB  2 bladerunner.fx.movie.edu.
               IN  AFSDB  1 empire.fx.movie.edu.
               IN  AFSDB  2 aliens.fx.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.6.3. X25, ISDN, and RT</h3>


These three record types were created specifically in support of
research on next-generation internets. Two of the records,
<a name="INDEX-2421" />X25 and
<a name="INDEX-2422" />ISDN, are
simply address records specific to
<a name="INDEX-2423" />X.25
and
<a name="INDEX-2424" />ISDN
networks, respectively. Both take record-specific data appropriate to
the type of network. The X25 record type uses an
X.121<a name="INDEX-2425" />
address (<a name="INDEX-2426" />X.121 is the ITU-T recommendation that
specifies the format of addresses used in X.25 networks). The ISDN
record type uses an ISDN address.</p><p>


ISDN stands for <a name="INDEX-2427" />Integrated Services
Digital Network. Telephone companies around the world use ISDN
protocols to allow their telephone networks to carry both voice and
data, creating an integrated network. Although ISDN's
availability is spotty throughout the U.S., it has been widely
adopted in some international markets. Since ISDN uses the telephone
companies' networks, an ISDN address is just a phone number,
and in fact consists of a country code, followed by an area code or
city code, then by a local phone number. Sometimes there are a few
extra digits at the end that you wouldn't see in a phone
number, called a subaddress. The subaddress is specified in a
separate field in the record-specific data.</p><p>


Examples of the X25 and ISDN record types are:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">relay.pink.com.  IN  X25  31105060845

delay.hp.com.    IN  ISDN  141555514539488
hep.hp.com.      IN  ISDN  141555514539488 004</pre></blockquote>


These records are intended for use in conjunction with the Route
Through (<a name="INDEX-2428" />
<a name="INDEX-2429" />
<a name="INDEX-2430" />RT) record type. RT is
syntactically and semantically similar to the MX record type: it
specifies an intermediate host that routes
<em class="emphasis">packets</em> (instead of mail) to a destination host.
So now, instead of being able to route only mail to a host that
isn't directly connected to the Internet, you can route any
kind of IP packet to that host by using another host as a forwarder.
The packet could be part of a Telnet or FTP session, or perhaps even
a DNS query!</p><p>


Like MX, RT includes a preference value indicating how desirable
delivery to a particular host is. For example, the records:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">housesitter.movie.edu.  IN  RT  10 relay.pink.com.
                        IN  RT  20 delay.hp.com.</pre></blockquote>


instruct hosts to route packets bound for <em class="emphasis">housesitter.movie.edu</em> through
<em class="emphasis">relay.pink.com</em> (the first
choice) or through <em class="emphasis">delay.hp.com</em>(the second choice).</p><p>


The way RT works with X25 and ISDN (and even A) records is like this:</p><p>


<ol><li>Internet host A wants to send a packet to host B, which is not
connected to the Internet.</p></li><li>Host A looks up host B's RT records. This search also returns
all address records (A, X25, and ISDN) for each intermediate host.</p></li><li>Host A sorts the list of intermediate hosts and looks for its own
domain name. If it finds it, the host removes its name and all
intermediate hosts at higher preference values. This is analogous to
<em class="filename">sendmail</em> 's "paring down" a
list of mail exchangers.</p></li><li>Host A examines the address record(s) for the most preferred
intermediate host that remains. If host A is attached to a network
that corresponds to the type of address record indicated, it uses
that network to send the packet to the intermediate host. For
example, if host A were trying to send a packet through <em class="emphasis">relay.pink.com</em>, it would need
connectivity to an X.25 network.</p></li><li>If host A lacks appropriate connectivity, it tries the next
intermediate host specified by the RT records. For example, if host A
lacked X.25 connectivity, it might fall back to connecting via ISDN
to <em class="emphasis">delay.hp.com</em>.</p></li></ol>
This process continues until the packet is routed to the most
preferred intermediate host. The most preferred intermediate host may
then deliver the packet directly to the destination host's
address (which may be A, X25, or ISDN).</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-6.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.6.4. Location</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2431" />RFC 1876 defines an
experimental record type, <a name="INDEX-2432" /> <a name="INDEX-2433" />LOC, that allows domain administrators to
encode the locations of their computers, subnets, and networks. In
this case, location means latitude, longitude, and altitude. Future
applications could use this information to produce network maps,
assess routing efficiency, and more.</p><p>


In its basic form, the LOC record takes latitude, longitude, and
altitude (in that order) as its record-specific data. Latitude and
longitude are expressed in the format:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;degrees&gt; [minutes [seconds.&lt;fractional seconds&gt;]] (N|S|E|W)</pre></blockquote>


Altitude is expressed in meters.</p><p>


If you're wondering how in the world you're going to get
that data, check out "RFC 1876 Resources" at <em class="emphasis">http://www.ckdhr.com/dns-loc</em>. This site,
created by Christopher Davis, one of the authors of RFC 1876, is an
indispensable collection of information, useful links, and utilities
for people creating LOC records.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-2434" />If you
don't have your own Global Positioning System receiver to carry
around to all of your computers -- and we <em class="emphasis">know
</em>many of you do -- two sites that may come in handy are
Etak's Eagle Geocoder at
<a name="INDEX-2435" /><a href="http://www.geocode.com/eagle.html-ssi">http://www.geocode.com/eagle.html-ssi</a>, which
you can use to find the latitude and longitude of most addresses in
the United States, and AirNav's Airport Information at
<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airports">http://www.airnav.com/airports</a>,
which lets you find the elevation of the closest airport to you. If
you don't have a major airport near you, don't worry: the
database even includes the helipad at my neighborhood hospital!</p><p>


Here's a LOC record for one of our hosts:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">huskymo.boulder.acmebw.com.  IN  LOC  40 2 0.373 N 105 17 23.528 W 1638m</pre></blockquote>


Optional fields in the record-specific data allow you to specify how
large the entity you're describing is, in meters (LOC records
can describe networks, after all, which can be quite large), as well
as the horizontal and vertical precision. The size defaults to one
meter, which is perfect for a single host. Horizontal precision
defaults to 10,000 meters, and vertical precision to 10 meters. These
defaults represent the size of a typical ZIP or postal code, the idea
being that you can fairly easily find a latitude and longitude given
a ZIP code.</p><p>


You can also attach LOC records to the names of subnets and networks.
If you've taken the time to enter information about the names
and addresses of your networks in the format described in RFC 1101
(covered earlier in this chapter), you can attach LOC records to the
network names:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">;
; Map HP's network name to 15.0.0.0.
;
hp-net.hp.com.   IN   PTR 0.0.0.15.in-addr.arpa.
                 IN   LOC 37 24 55.393 N 122 8 37 W 26m</pre></blockquote>

<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-6.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.6.5. SRV</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2436" />Locating a service or a particular type
of server within a zone is a difficult problem if you don't
know which host it runs on. Some zone administrators have attempted
to solve this problem by using service-specific aliases in their
zones. For example, at Movie U. we created the alias <em class="emphasis">ftp.movie.edu</em> and pointed it to the domain name of the host that runs our FTP archive:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">ftp.movie.edu.      IN    CNAME           plan9.fx.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


This makes it easy for people to guess a domain name that will get
them to our FTP archive, and separates the domain name people use to
access the archive from the domain name of the host it runs on. If we
were to move the archive to a different host, we could simply change
the CNAME record.</p><p>


The experimental SRV record, introduced in RFC 2052, is a general
mechanism for locating services. SRV also provides powerful features
that allow zone administrators to distribute load and provide backup
services, similar to what the MX record provides.</p><p>


A unique aspect of the SRV record is the format of the domain name
it's attached to. Like service-specific aliases, the domain
name to which an SRV record is attached gives the name of the service
sought, as well as the protocol it runs over, concatenated with a
domain name. The labels representing the service name and the
protocol begin with an underscore to distinguish them from labels in
the domain name of a host. So, for example:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">_ftp._tcp.movie.edu</pre></blockquote>


represents the SRV records someone FTPing to <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> should retrieve in order to
find the <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> FTP
servers, while:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">_http._tcp.www.movie.edu</pre></blockquote>


represents the SRV records someone accessing the URL <em class="emphasis">http://www.movie.edu</em>should look up in order
to find the <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em>web servers.</p><p>


The names of the service and protocol should appear in the latest
Assigned Numbers RFC (the most recent as of this writing is RFC 1700)
or be unique names used only locally. Don't use the port or
protocol <em class="emphasis">numbers</em>, just the names.</p><p>


The SRV record has four resource record-specific fields:
<em class="firstterm">priority</em>, <em class="firstterm">weight</em>,
<em class="firstterm">port</em>, and <em class="firstterm">target</em>.
Priority, weight, and port are unsigned 16-bit numbers (between
and 65535). Target is a domain name.</p><p>


Priority works very similarly to the preference in an MX record: the
lower the number in the priority field, the more desirable the
associated target. When searching for hosts offering a given service,
clients should try targets at the same priority before trying those
at a higher priority value.</p><p>


Weight allows zone administrators to distribute load to multiple
targets. Clients should query targets that are at the same priority
in proportion to their weight. For example, if one target has a
priority of zero and a weight of one, and another target also has a
priority of zero but a weight of two, the second target should
receive twice as much load (in queries, connections, whatever) as the
first. It's up to the service's clients to direct that
load: they typically use a system call to choose a random number. If
the number is, say, in the top one-third of the range, they try the
first target, and if the number is in the bottom two-thirds of the
range, they try the second target.</p><p>


Port specifies the port on which the service being sought is running.
This allows zone administrators to run servers on nonstandard ports.
For example, an administrator could use SRV records to point web
browsers at a web server running on port 8000 instead of the standard
HTTP port (80).</p><p>


Target, finally, specifies the domain name of a host on which the
service is running (on the port specified in the port field). Target
must be the canonical name of the host (not an alias), with address
records attached to it.</p><p>


So, for the <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> FTP
server, we added these records to <em class="filename">db.movie.edu</em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">_ftp._tcp.movie.edu.  IN  SRV  1  0  21  plan9.fx.movie.edu.
                      IN  SRV  2  0  21  thing.fx.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


This instructs SRV-capable FTP clients to try the FTP server on
<em class="emphasis">plan9.fx.movie.edu</em>'s
port 21 first when accessing <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>'s FTP service, and then
to try the FTP server on <em class="emphasis">thing.fx.movie.edu</em>'s port 21 if
<em class="emphasis">plan9.fx.movie.edu</em>'s
FTP server isn't available.</p><p>


The records:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">_http._tcp.www.movie.edu.  IN  SRV  0  2  80   www.movie.edu.
                           IN  SRV  0  1  80   www2.movie.edu.
                           IN  SRV  1  1  8000 postmanrings2x.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


direct web queries for <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em>(the web site) to port 80 on <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em> (the host) and <em class="emphasis">www2.movie.edu</em>, with <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em> getting twice the queries
that <em class="emphasis">www2.movie.edu</em> does. If
neither is available, the queries will go to <em class="emphasis">postmanrings2x.movie.edu</em> on port 8000.</p><p>


To advertise that a particular service isn't available, use a dot in the target field:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">_gopher._tcp.movie.edu.  IN  SRV  0  0  0  .</pre></blockquote>


Unfortunately, support for the SRV record among clients is, to put it
mildly, thin -- with Windows 2000 being the glaring exception.
(More about that later in this chapter.) That's really too bad,
given how useful SRV could be. Since SRV isn't widely
supported, don't use SRV records in lieu of address records.
It's prudent to include at least one address record for the
"base" domain name to which your SRV records are
attached, and more if you'd like the load spread between
addresses. If you only list a host as a backup in the SRV records,
don't include its IP address. Also, if a host runs a service on
a nonstandard port, don't include an address record for it
since there's no way to redirect clients to a nonstandard port
with an A record.</p><p>


So, for <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em>, we
included all these records:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">_http._tcp.www.movie.edu.  IN  SRV  0  2  80   www.movie.edu.
                           IN  SRV  0  1  80   www2.movie.edu.
                           IN  SRV  1  1  8000 postmanrings2x.movie.edu.
www.movie.edu.             IN  A    200.1.4.3 ; the address of www.movie.edu and
                           IN  A    200.1.4.4 ; the address of www2.movie.edu
                                              ; for the benefit of non-SRV aware
                                              ; clients</pre></blockquote>


Browsers that can handle SRV records will send twice as many requests
to <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em> as to
<em class="emphasis">www2.movie.edu</em>, and will use
<em class="emphasis">postmanrings2x.movie.edu</em>only if both of the main web servers are unavailable.
Browsers that don't use SRV records will have their requests
round-robined between the addresses of <em class="emphasis">www.movie.edu</em> and<a name="INDEX-2437" /> <em class="emphasis">www2.movie.edu</em>.<a name="INDEX-2438" /></p><p>
