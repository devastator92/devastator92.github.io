<h2 class="sect1">9.2. How Many Children?</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1435" />Of course, you won't simply
say, "I want to create four subdomains." Deciding how
many subdomains to implement is really choosing the organizational
affiliation of those subdomains. For example, if your company has
four branch offices, you might decide to create four subdomains, each
of which corresponds to a branch office.</p><p>


Should you create subdomains for each site, for each division, or
even for each department? You have a lot of latitude in your choice
because of DNS's scalability. You can create a few large
subdomains or many small subdomains. There are trade-offs whichever
you choose, though.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1436" />
<a name="INDEX-1437" />Delegating to a few large subdomains
isn't much work for the parent because there's not much
delegation to keep track of. However, you wind up with larger
subdomains, which require more memory to load and faster name
servers, and administration isn't as distributed. If you
implement site-level subdomains, for example, you may force
autonomous or unrelated groups at a site to share a single zone and a
single point of administration.</p><p>


Delegating to many smaller subdomains can be a headache for the
administrator of the parent. Keeping delegation data current involves
keeping track of which hosts run name servers and which zones
they're authoritative for. The data changes each time a
subdomain adds a new name server, or when the address of a name
server for the subdomain changes. If the subdomains are all
administered by different people, that means more administrators to
train, more relationships for the parent's administrator to
maintain, and more overhead for the organization overall. On the
other hand, the subdomains are smaller and easier to manage, and the
administration is more widely distributed, allowing closer management
of zone data.</p><p>


Given the advantages and disadvantages of either alternative, it may
seem difficult to make a choice. Actually, though, there's
probably a natural division in your organization. Some companies
manage computers and networks at the site level; others have
decentralized, relatively autonomous workgroups that manage
everything themselves. Here are a few basic rules to help you find
the right way to carve up your
<a name="INDEX-1438" />
<a name="INDEX-1439" />namespace:</p><p>


<ul><li>Don't shoehorn your organization into a weird or uncomfortable
structure. Trying to fit 50 independent, unrelated U.S. divisions
into four regional subdomains may save you work (as the administrator
of the parent zone), but it won't help your reputation.
Decentralized, autonomous operations demand different
zones -- that's the <em class="emphasis">raison
d'&ecirc;tre</em> of the Domain Name System.</p></li><li>The structure of your domain should mirror the structure of your
organization, especially your organization's
<em class="emphasis">support</em> structure. If departments run networks,
assign IP addresses, and manage hosts, then departments should manage
the subdomains.</p></li><li>If you're not sure or can't agree about how the namespace
should be organized, try to come up with guidelines for when a group
within your organization can carve off its own subdomain (e.g., how
many hosts you need to create a new subdomain, what level of support
the group must provide) and grow the namespace organically, only as
needed.</p></li></ul>
