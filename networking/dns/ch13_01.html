<em>"O Tiger-lily!" said Alice, addressing herself to one

<a name="INDEX-2079" /></a>One of
the tools in your
<a name="INDEX-2080" /></a>troubleshooting
toolchest is the name server's debugging output. As long as
your name server has been compiled with DEBUG defined, you can get
query-by-query reports of its internal operation. The messages you
get are often quite cryptic; they were meant for someone who has the
source code to follow. We'll explain some of the debugging
output in this chapter. Our goal is to cover just enough for you to
follow what the name server is doing; we aren't trying to
supply an exhaustive compilation of debugging messages.</p><p>


As you read through the explanations here, think back to material
covered in earlier chapters. Seeing this information again, in
another context, should help you understand more fully how a name
server works.</p><p>

<h2 class="sect1">13.1. Debugging Levels</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2081" /></a><a name="INDEX-2082" /></a>The amount of information the name
server provides depends on the debugging level. The lower the
debugging level, the less information you get. Higher debugging
levels give you more information, but they also fill up your disk
faster. After you've read a lot of debugging output,
you'll develop a feel for how much information you'll
need to solve any particular problem. Of course, if you can easily
recreate the problem, you can start at level 1 and increase the
debugging level until you have enough information. For the most basic
problem -- why a name can't be looked up -- level 1 will
often suffice, so you should start there.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-13-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.1.1. What Information Is at Each Level?</h3>


Here's a list of the information that each debugging level
produces for BIND 8 and BIND 9 name servers. The debugging
information is cumulative; for example, level 2 includes all of level
1's debugging information. The data is divided into the
following basic areas: starting up, updating the database, processing
queries, and maintaining zones. We won't cover updating the
name server's internal database -- problems almost always
occur elsewhere. However, <em class="emphasis">what</em> the name server
adds or deletes from its internal database can be a problem, as
you'll see in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Troubleshooting DNS and BIND"</a>.</p><p>


BIND 8 and 9 have a whopping 99 debug levels, but most of the
debugging messages are logged at just a few of those levels.
We'll look at those now.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-13-SECT-1.1.1" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.1.1.1. BIND 8 debugging levels</h3>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 1</i></dt>
<dd>The information at this level is necessarily brief. Name servers can
process <em class="emphasis">lots</em> of queries, which can create
<em class="emphasis">lots</em> of debugging output. Since the output is
condensed, you can collect data over long periods. Use this debugging
level for basic startup information and for watching query
transactions. You'll see some errors logged at this level,
including syntax errors and DNS packet formatting errors. This level
also shows referrals.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 2</i></dt>
<dd>Level 2 provides lots of useful stuff: it lists the IP addresses of
remote name servers used during a lookup, along with their roundtrip
time values; it calls out bad responses; and it tags a response as to
which type of query it is answering, a SYSTEM (sysquery) or a USER
query. When you are tracking down a problem with a slave server
loading a zone, this level shows you the zone values -- serial
number, refresh time, retry time, expire time, and time left -- as
the slave checks if it is up to date with its master.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 3</i></dt>
<dd>Level 3 debugging becomes much more verbose, because it generates
lots of messages about updating the name server database. Make sure
you have enough disk space if you are going to collect debugging
output at level 3 or above. At level 3, you also see duplicate
queries called out, system queries generated (sysquery), the names of
the remote name servers used during a lookup, and the number of
addresses found for each server.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 4</i></dt>
<dd>Use level 4 debugging when you want to see the query and response
packets <em class="emphasis">received</em> by the name server. This level
also shows the credibility level for cached data.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 5</i></dt>
<dd>There are a variety of messages at level 5, but none of them is
particularly useful for general debugging. This level includes some
error messages, for example when a <em class="emphasis">malloc( )</em>
fails or when the name server gives up on a query.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 6</i></dt>
<dd>Level 6 shows you the response sent to the original query.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 7</i></dt>
<dd>Level 7 shows you a few configuration and parsing messages.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 8</i></dt>
<dd>There is no significant debugging information at this level.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 9</i></dt>
<dd>There is no significant debugging information at this level.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 10</i></dt>
<dd>Use level 10 debugging when you want to see the query and response
packets <em class="emphasis">sent</em> by the name server. The format of
these packets is the same format used in level 4. You won't use
this level very often since you can see the name server response
packet with <em class="filename">nslookup</em> or
<em class="filename">dig</em>.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 11</i></dt>
<dd>There are only a couple of debugging messages at and above this
level, and they are in seldom-traversed code.<p></p></dd>

</dl>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-13-SECT-1.1.2" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.1.1.2. BIND 9 debugging levels</h3>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 1</i></dt>
<dd>Level 1 shows you basic name server operation: zone loading,
maintenance (including SOA queries, zone transfers and zone
expiration, and cache cleaning), NOTIFY messages, queries received,
and high-level tasks dispatched (such as looking up addresses for a
name server).<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 2</i></dt>
<dd>Level 2 logs multicast requests.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 3</i></dt>
<dd>Level 3 shows you low-level task creation and operation.
Unfortunately, most of these tasks don't have particularly
descriptive names (<em class="emphasis">requestmgr_detach</em> ?) and the
arguments they report are awfully cryptic. Level 3 also shows you
journal activity, such as when the name server writes a record of a
zone change to the zone's journal or when the name server
applies a journal to a zone at startup. Operation of the DNSSEC
validator and checking of TSIG signatures also come in at debug level
3.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 4</i></dt>
<dd>Level 4 logs when a master name server falls back to using AXFR
because the transferred zone's journal isn't available.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 5</i></dt>
<dd>Level 5 logs which view was used while satisfying a particular
request.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 6</i></dt>
<dd>A handful of outbound zone transfer messages are logged at level 6,
including checks of the query that initiated the transfer.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 7</i></dt>
<dd>There are only a couple of new debugging messages at this level
(logging of journal adds and deletes, and a count of how many bytes
were returned by a zone transfer).<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 8</i></dt>
<dd>Many dynamic update messages are logged at level 8: prerequisite
checks, writing journal entries, and rollbacks. Several low-level
zone transfer messages also appear here, including a log of resource
records sent in a zone transfer.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 10</i></dt>
<dd>Level 10 reports a couple of messages about zone timer activity.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 20</i></dt>
<dd>Level 20 reports an update to a zone's refresh timer.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Level 90</i></dt>
<dd>Low-level operation of the BIND 9 task dispatcher is logged at level
90.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


With BIND 8 and BIND 9, you can configure the name server to print
out the debug level with the debug message. Just turn on the logging
option <em class="emphasis">print-severity</em> as explained in <a href="ch07_05.html#dns4-CHP-7-SECT-5">Section 7.5, "Logging in BIND 8 and 9"</a> in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Maintaining BIND"</a>.</p><p>


Keep in mind that this <em class="emphasis">is</em> debugging
information -- it was used by the authors of BIND to debug the
code, so it is not as readable as you might like. You can use it to
figure out why the name server isn't doing what you think it
should be or just to learn how the name server operates -- but
don't expect nicely designed, carefully formatted
output.<a name="INDEX-2083" /></a><a name="INDEX-2084" /></a></p><p>
