<h2 class="sect1">16.7. DNS and WINS</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2439" /> <a name="INDEX-2440" />In our
first edition -- oh, for those simpler days! -- we mentioned
the close alignment between NetBIOS names and domain names, but noted
that, alas, there was no way for DNS to function as a NetBIOS name
server. Basically, a name server would need to support dynamic
updates to function as a NetBIOS name server.</p><p>


Of course, BIND 8 and 9 support dynamic updates. Unfortunately, the
DHCP server in Windows NT 4.0 doesn't send dynamic updates to
name servers. It talks only to Microsoft's WINS servers. WINS
servers handle their own peculiar, proprietary dynamic updates,
though only for NetBIOS clients. In other words, a WINS server
doesn't speak DNS.</p><p>


However, Microsoft provides a name server in Windows NT 4.0, which in
turn can talk to WINS servers. The Microsoft DNS Server has a nice
graphical administration tool, as you would expect from Microsoft,
and provides a handy hook into WINS: you can configure the server to
query a WINS server for address data if it doesn't find the
data in a DNS zone.</p><p>


This is done by adding a new WINS<em class="firstterm"> </em>record to
the zone. The WINS record, like the SOA record, is attached to the
zone's domain name. It acts as a flag to tell the Microsoft DNS
Server to query a WINS server if it doesn't find an address for
the name it's looking up. The record:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">@        0       IN     WINS            192.249.249.39 192.253.253.39</pre></blockquote>


tells the Microsoft DNS Server to query the WINS servers running at
192.249.249.39 and 192.253.253.39 (in that order) for the name. The
zero TTL is a precaution against the record being looked up and
cached.</p><p>


There's also a companion WINS-R record that allows a Microsoft
DNS Server to reverse map IP addresses using a NetBIOS NBSTAT
request. If an <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>zone contains a WINS-R record, like:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">@        0      IN      WINS-R          movie.edu</pre></blockquote>


and the IP address sought doesn't appear in the zone, the name
server will attempt to send a NetBIOS NBSTAT request to the IP
address being reverse mapped. This amounts to calling a phone number
and asking the person on the other end, "What's your
name?" The result has a dot and the domain name in the
record-specific data appended, in this case ".movie.edu".</p><p>


These records provide valuable glue between the two namespaces.
Unfortunately, the integration isn't perfect. As they say, the
devil is in the details.</p><p>


The main problem, as we see it, is that only the Microsoft DNS
Servers support the WINS and WINS-R records.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-106">[106]</a>
Therefore, if you want lookups in the <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em> zone to be relayed to the
Special Effects Department's WINS server, then all <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em> name servers must be
Microsoft DNS Servers. Why? Imagine that the name servers for
<em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em> were mixed,
some Microsoft DNS Servers and some BIND. If a remote name server
needed to look up a NetBIOS name in <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em>, it would choose which of
the <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em> name
servers to query according to roundtrip time. If the server it
happened to choose were a Microsoft DNS Server, it would be able to
resolve the name to a dynamically assigned address. But if it
happened to choose a BIND server, it wouldn't be able to
resolve the name.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-106" />[106]And a
few commercial products such as MetaInfo's Meta IP/DNS, which
is a port of BIND 8 with WINS capabilities added on. Stock BIND,
however, can't talk to WINS servers.</p><p>

</blockquote>


The best DNS-WINS configuration we've heard of so far puts all
WINS-mapped data in its own zone, say <em class="emphasis">wins.movie.edu</em>. All the name servers for
<em class="emphasis">wins.movie.edu</em> are Microsoft
DNS Servers, and the zone <em class="emphasis">wins.movie.edu</em>contains just an SOA record, NS records, and a WINS
record pointing to the WINS servers for <em class="emphasis">wins.movie.edu</em>. This way, there's
no chance of inconsistent answers between authoritative servers for
the zone.</p><p>


Reverse-mapping data, of course, can't easily be split into
separate zones for BIND and Microsoft name servers to maintain. So if
you want both traditional, PTR record-based reverse mapping and
WINS-R-enhanced reverse mapping, you'll need to host your
reverse-mapping zones solely on Microsoft DNS Servers.</p><p>


Another problem is that WINS and WINS-R are proprietary. BIND name
servers don't understand them, and in fact a BIND slave that
transfers a WINS record from a Microsoft DNS Server primary master
will fail to load the zone because WINS is an unknown type. (We
discussed this, and how to work around it, in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Troubleshooting DNS and BIND"</a>.)</p><p>


The answer to these problems is the DNS standard dynamic update
functionality introduced in BIND 8, described in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>, and the support for it in Windows 2000.
Dynamic update allows authorized addition and deletion of records in
a BIND name server, which in turn gives the folks at Microsoft the
functionality they need to use DNS as a name service for NetBIOS. So
without further ado . . . <a name="INDEX-2441" /> <a name="INDEX-2442" /></p><p>
