<h2 class="sect1">10.12. System Tuning</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1661" /> <a name="INDEX-1662" />While for many name servers
BIND's default configuration values work just fine, yours may
be one of those that need some further tuning. In this section, we
discuss all the various dials and switches available to you to tune
your name server.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.12.1. Zone Transfers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1663" />Zone
transfers can place a heavy load on a name server. On BIND 4 name
servers, outbound zone transfers (transfers of a zone the server is
master for) require <em class="emphasis">fork( )</em> ing the
<em class="emphasis">named</em> process, thereby using a significant
amount of extra memory. BIND 4.9 introduced mechanisms for limiting
the zone transfer load that your name server places on its master
servers. BIND 8 and 9 have these mechanisms and more.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.1.1. Limiting transfers requested per name server</h3>


With BIND 4.9 and later, you can limit the number of zones your
<a name="INDEX-1664" />name server
<a name="INDEX-1665" />requests from a single remote name
server. This will make the administrator of the remote name server
happy because his host won't be pounded for zone transfers if
all of the zones change -- important if hundreds of zones are
involved.</p><p>


In BIND 8 and 9, the config file statement is:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	transfers-per-ns 2;
};</pre></blockquote>


The equivalent BIND 4 boot file directive is:</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1666" /><a name="INDEX-1667" /><blockquote><pre class="code">limit transfers-per-ns 2</pre></blockquote>


In BIND 9, you can also set the limit on a server-by-server basis
instead of globally. To do this, use the
<em class="emphasis">transfers</em> substatement inside a <em class="emphasis">server
</em>statement, where the server is the name server you'd
like to specify the limit for:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">server 192.168.1.2 {
	transfers 2;
};</pre></blockquote>


This overrides any global limit set in the <em class="emphasis">options
</em>statement. The default limit is two active zone transfers
per name server. That limit may seem small, but it works.
Here's what happens: suppose your name server needs to load
four zones from a remote name server. Your name server starts
transferring the first two zones and wait to transfer the third and
fourth zones. After one of the first two zone transfers completes,
the name server begins transferring the third zone. After another
transfer completes, the name server starts transferring the fourth
zone. The net result is the same as before there were
limits -- all the zones are transferred -- but the work is
spread out.</p><p>


When might you need to increase this limit? You might notice that it
is taking too long to synch up with the remote name server, and you
know that the reason is the serializing of transfers -- not just
that the network between the hosts is slow. This probably matters
only if you're maintaining hundreds or thousands of zones. You
also need to make sure that the remote name server and the networks
in between can handle the additional workload of more simultaneous
zone transfers.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.1.2. Limiting the total number of zone transfers requested</h3>


The last limit dealt with the zone transfers requested from a single
remote name server. This limit deals with multiple remote name
servers. BIND Versions 4.9 and later let you limit the total number
of zones your name server can request at any one time. The default
limit is 10. As we explained previously, your name server will pull
only two zones from any single remote server by default. If your name
server is transferring two zones from each of five remote servers,
your server has hit the limit and will postpone any further transfers
until one of the current transfers finishes.</p><p>


The BIND 8 and 9 <em class="emphasis">named.conf</em> file statement is:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	transfers-in 10;
};</pre></blockquote>


The equivalent BIND 4 boot file directive is:</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1668" /><a name="INDEX-1669" /><blockquote><pre class="code">limit transfers-in 10</pre></blockquote>


If your host or network cannot handle 10 active zone transfers, you
should decrease this number. If you run a server that supports
hundreds or thousands of zones and your host and network can support
the load, you might want to raise this limit. If you raise this
limit, you may also need to raise the limit for the number of
transfers per name server. (For example, if your name server loads
from only four remote name servers and your name server will start
only two transfers per remote name server, then your server will have
at most eight active zone transfers. Increasing the limit for the
total number of zone transfers won't have any effect unless you
also increase the per-name server limit.)</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.1.3. Limiting the total number of zone transfers served</h3>


BIND 9 name servers can also limit the number of zone transfers
they'll <em class="emphasis">serve</em> simultaneously. This is
arguably more useful than limiting the number you'll request,
since without it you'd have to rely on the kindness of the
administrators who run your slave name servers not to overload your
master server. The BIND 9 statement is:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	transfers-out 10;
};</pre></blockquote>


The default limit is 10.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.1.4. Limiting the duration of a zone transfer</h3>


BIND 8 and 9 also let you limit the duration of an inbound zone
transfer. By default, zone transfers are limited to 120 minutes, or
two hours. The idea is that a zone transfer taking longer than 120
minutes is probably hung and won't complete, and the process is
taking up resources unnecessarily. If you'd like a smaller or
larger limit, perhaps because you know that your name server is a
slave for a zone that normally takes more than 120 minutes to
transfer, you can use this statement:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	max-transfer-time-in 180;
};</pre></blockquote>


You can even place a limit on transfers of a particular zone by using
the <em class="emphasis">max-transfer-time-in
</em><a name="INDEX-1670" />substatement inside a
<em class="emphasis">zone</em> statement. For example, if you know that
the <em class="emphasis">rinkydink.com</em> zone always takes a long time
(say three hours) to transfer, either because of its size or because
the links to the master name server are so slow, but you'd
still like a shorter time limit (maybe an hour) on other zone
transfers, you could use:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	max-transfer-time-in 60;
};

zone "rinkydink.com" {
	type slave;
	file "bak.rinkydink.com";
	masters { 192.168.1.2; };
	max-transfer-time-in 180;
};</pre></blockquote>


In BIND 9, there's also a
<em class="emphasis">max-transfer-time-out</em><a name="INDEX-1671" /> substatement that can be used the
same way (either within an <em class="emphasis">options</em> statement or
a <em class="emphasis">zone</em> statement). It controls how long an
outbound zone transfer (i.e., a transfer to a slave) can run and has
the same default value (120 minutes) as
<em class="emphasis">max-transfer-time-in</em>.</p><p>


BIND 9 name servers even let you limit zone transfer idle time, the
length of time since the zone transfer made any progress. The two
configuration substatements, <em class="emphasis">max-transfer-idle-in
</em><a name="INDEX-1672" />and
<em class="emphasis">max-transfer-idle-out</em><a name="INDEX-1673" />, control how long an inbound and
an outbound zone transfer can be idle, respectively. Like the
transfer time limits, both can be used as either an
<em class="emphasis">options</em> substatement or a <em class="emphasis">zone
</em>substatement. The default limit on idle time is 60
minutes.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1.5" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.1.5. Limiting the frequency of zone transfers</h3>


It's possible to set a zone's refresh interval so low as
to cause slave name servers for that zone undue work. For example, if
your name server is a slave for thousands of zones and the
administrators of some of those zones set their refresh intervals to
very small values, your name server may not be able to keep up with
all the refreshing it needs to do. (If you run a name server
that's a slave for that many zones, be sure to read the later
section "Limiting the number of SOA queries"; you may
also need to tune the number of SOA queries allowed.) On the other
hand, it's possible for an inexperienced administrator to set
her zone's refresh interval so high as to cause prolonged
inconsistencies between the zone's primary master and slave
name servers.</p><p>


BIND Versions 9.1.0 and later let you limit the refresh interval with
<em class="emphasis">max-refresh-time</em><a name="INDEX-1674" /> and
<em class="emphasis">min-refresh-time</em><a name="INDEX-1675" />. These substatements bracket the
refresh value for all master, slave, and stub zones if used as an
<em class="emphasis">options</em> substatement, or just for a particular
zone if used as a <em class="emphasis">zone</em> substatement. Both take a
number of seconds as an argument:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	max-refresh-time 86400;    // refresh should never be more than a day
	min-refresh-time 1800;     // or less than 30 minutes
};</pre></blockquote>


BIND 9.1.0 and later name servers also let you limit the retry
interval with the <em class="emphasis">max-retry-time
</em><a name="INDEX-1676" />and
<em class="emphasis">min-retry-time</em><a name="INDEX-1677" /> substatements, which use the same
syntax.<a name="INDEX-1678" /></p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.1.6" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.1.6. More efficient zone transfers</h3>


A <a name="INDEX-1679" />zone
<a name="INDEX-1680" />transfer, as we said
earlier, is composed of many DNS messages sent end-to-end over a TCP
connection. Traditional zone transfers put only a single resource
record in each DNS message. That's a waste of space: you need a
full header on each DNS message, even though you're carrying
only a single record. It's like being the only person in a
Chevy Suburban. A TCP-based DNS message couldcarry many more records: its maximum size is a whopping 64
KB!</p><p>


BIND 8 and 9 name servers understand a new zone transfer format,
called <em class="emphasis">many-answers</em>. The <em class="emphasis">many-answers
</em><a name="INDEX-1681" />format puts as many records as possible
into a single DNS message. The result is that a
<em class="emphasis">many-answers</em> zone transfer takes less bandwidth
because there's less overhead, and less CPU time because less
time is spent unmarshaling DNS messages.</p><p>


The <a name="INDEX-1682" /><em class="emphasis">transfer-format
</em>substatement controls which zone transfer format the name
server uses for zones for which it is a master. That is, it
determines the format of the zones that your name server transfers to
its slaves. <em class="emphasis">transfer-format</em> is both an
<em class="emphasis">options</em> substatement and a <em class="emphasis">server
</em>substatement; as an <em class="emphasis">options
</em>substatement, <em class="emphasis">transfer-format
</em>controls the name server's global zone transfer
format. BIND 8's default is to use the old <em class="emphasis">one-answer
</em><a name="INDEX-1683" />zone
transfer format for interoperability with BIND 4 name servers. BIND
9's default is to use the <em class="emphasis">many-answers
</em>format. The statement:</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1684" /><blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	transfer-format many-answers;
};</pre></blockquote>


changes the name server's settings to use the
<em class="emphasis">many-answers</em> format for zone transfers to all
slave servers, unless a <em class="emphasis">server</em> statement like
the following explicitly says otherwise:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">server 192.168.1.2 {
	transfer-format one-answer;
};</pre></blockquote>


The one downside to using the <em class="emphasis">many-answers
</em>format is that zone transfers can actually take longer to
complete using the new format, despite being more efficient from a
bandwidth and CPU utilization point of view.</p><p>


If you'd like to take advantage of the new, more efficient zone
transfers, do one of the following:</p><p>


<ul><li>Set your name server's global zone transfer format to
<em class="emphasis">many-answers</em> (or don't add one at all if
you're running BIND 9) if most of your slaves run BIND 8, BIND
9, or Microsoft's DNS Server, which also understands the
format.</p></li><li>Set your name server's global zone transfer format to
<em class="emphasis">one-answer</em>, if most of your slaves run BIND 4.
Then use the <em class="emphasis">transfer-format server</em> substatement
to adjust the global setting for exceptional servers.</p></li></ul>
Remember that if you run BIND 9, you'll need to add an explicit
<em class="emphasis">server</em> statement for all BIND 4 slaves to change
their transfer formats to <em class="emphasis">one-answer</em>.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.12.2. Resource Limits</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1685" />
<a name="INDEX-1686" />Sometimes you just want to tell the
name server to stop being so greedy: don't use more than this
much memory, don't open more than this many files. BIND 4.9
introduced these limits, and, as with so many features, BIND 8 and 9
give you several new variations.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.2.1. Changing the data segment size limit</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1687" />
<a name="INDEX-1688" />Some operating systems place a
default limit on the amount of memory a process can use. If your OS
ever prevents your name server from allocating additional memory, the
server will panic or exit. Unless your name server handles an
extremely large amount of data or the limit is very small, you
won't run into this limit. But if you do, BIND 4.9 and 8 as
well as BIND 9.1.0 and later name servers have configuration options
to change the system's default limit on data segment size. You
might use these options to set a higher limit for
<em class="emphasis">named</em> than the default system limit.</p><p>


For BIND 8 and 9, the statement is:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	datasize size          
};</pre></blockquote>


For BIND 4, the directive is:</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1689" /><a name="INDEX-1690" /><blockquote><pre class="code">limit datasize size</pre></blockquote>


<em class="emphasis">size</em> is an integer value, specified in bytes by
default. You can specify a unit other than bytes by appending a
character: k (kilobyte), m (megabyte), or g (gigabyte). For example,
"64m" is 64 megabytes.</p><p>


<a name="ch10-36-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b>
Not all systems support increasing the data segment size for
individual processes. If your system doesn't, the name server
will issue a <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> message at level LOG_WARNING
to tell you that this feature is not implemented.</p><p>

</blockquote>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.2.2. Changing the stack size limit</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1691" />In addition to allowing you to change
the limit on the size of the name server's data segment, BIND 8
and BIND 9.1.0 and later name servers let you adjust the limit the
system places on the amount of memory the <em class="emphasis">named</em>
process's stack can use. The syntax
is:<a name="INDEX-1692" /></p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	stacksize size;
};</pre></blockquote>


where <em class="emphasis">size</em> is specified as in
<em class="emphasis">datasize</em>. Like <em class="emphasis">datasize</em>,
this feature works only on systems that permit a process to modify
the stack size limit.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.2.3. Changing the core size limit</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1693" />If
you don't appreciate <em class="emphasis">named</em> 's
leaving huge core files lying around on your filesystem, you can at
least make them smaller by using <em class="emphasis">coresize</em>.
Conversely, if <em class="emphasis">named</em> hasn't been able to
dump an entire core file because of a tight operating system limit,
you may be able to raise that limit with
<em class="emphasis">coresize</em>.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1694" /><em class="emphasis">coresize</em>'s
syntax is:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	coresize size;
};</pre></blockquote>


Again, as with <em class="emphasis">datasize</em>, this feature works only
on operating systems that let processes modify the limit on core file
size, and doesn't work on versions of BIND 9 before 9.1.0.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.2.4. Changing the open files limit</h3>


If your name server is authoritative for a lot of zones, the
<em class="emphasis">named</em> process opens lots of
<a name="INDEX-1695" />files when
it starts up -- one per authoritative zone, assuming you use
backup zone data files on the zones you're a slave for.
Likewise, if the host running your name server has lots of virtual
network interfaces,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-79">[79]</a>
<em class="emphasis">named</em> requires one file descriptor per
interface. Most Unix operating systems place a limit on the number of
files any process can open concurrently. If your name server tries to
open more files than this limit permits, you'll see this
message in your <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> output:</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-79" />[79]<a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Troubleshooting DNS and BIND"</a>,
describes better solutions to the "Too many open files"
problem than bumping up the limit on files.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote><pre class="code">named[pid]: socket(SOCK_RAW): Too many open files</pre></blockquote>


If your operating system also permits changing that limit on a
per-process basis, you can increase it using BIND's
<em class="emphasis">files</em> substatement:<a name="INDEX-1696" /></p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	files number;
};</pre></blockquote>


The default is <em class="emphasis">unlimited</em> (which is also a valid
value), although this just means that the name server doesn't
place a limit on the number of concurrently open files; the operating
system may, however. And though we know you're sick of our
saying it, BIND 9 doesn't support this until 9.1.0.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2.5" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.2.5. Limiting the number of clients</h3>


BIND 9 gives you the ability to restrict the number of
<a name="INDEX-1697" />clients your name server will serve
concurrently. You can apply a limit to the number of recursive
clients (resolvers plus name servers using your name server as a
forwarder) with the
<em class="emphasis">recursive-clients</em><a name="INDEX-1698" /> substatement:</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1699" /><blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	recursive-clients 10;
};</pre></blockquote>


The default limit is 1000. If you find your name server refusing
recursive queries and logging, as shown by an error message like this
one:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Sep 22 02:26:11 terminator named[13979]: client 192.249.249.151#1677: no more 
recursive clients: quota reached</pre></blockquote>


you may want to increase the limit. Conversely, if you find your name
server struggling to keep up with the deluge of recursive queries it
receives, you could lower the limit.</p><p>


You can also apply a limit to the number of concurrent TCP
connections your name server will process (for zone transfers and
TCP-based queries) with the <em class="emphasis">tcp-clients
</em>substatement. TCP connections consume considerably more
resources than UDP because the host needs to track the state of the
TCP connection. The default limit is 100.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.2.6" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.2.6. Limiting the number of SOA queries</h3>


BIND 8.2.2 and later name servers let you limit the number of
outstanding SOA queries your name server allows. If your name server
is a slave for thousands of zones, it may have many queries for the
<a name="INDEX-1700" />SOA records of those zones pending
at any one time. Tracking each of those queries requires a small but
finite amount of memory, so by default BIND 8 name servers limit
outstanding SOA queries to four. If you find that your name server
can't keep up with its duties as a slave, you may need to raise
the limit with the
<em class="emphasis">serial-queries</em><a name="INDEX-1701" /> substatement:</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1702" /><blockquote><pre class="code">options { 
	serial-queries 1000;
};</pre></blockquote>


<em class="emphasis">serial-queries</em> is obsolete in BIND 9. BIND 9
limits the rate at which serial queries are sent (to 20 per second),
not the number of outstanding queries.<a name="INDEX-1703" /> <a name="INDEX-1704" /></p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.12.3. Maintenance Intervals</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1705" />
<a name="INDEX-1706" /> <a name="INDEX-1707" />BIND name servers have always done
periodic housekeeping, such as refreshing zones for which the server
is a slave. With BIND 8 and 9, you can now control how often these
chores happen or whether they happen at all.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.3.1. Cleaning interval</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1708" /><a name="INDEX-1709" />Name servers older than BIND 4.9
only passively remove stale entries from the cache. Before such a
name server returns a record to a querier, it checks to see whether
the TTL on that record has expired. If it has, the name server starts
the resolution process to find more current data. This means that a
BIND 4 server may cache a lot of records in a flurry of name
resolution and then just let those records spoil in the cache, taking
up valuable memory even though the records are stale.</p><p>


BIND 8 and 9 actively walk through the cache and remove stale records
once per cleaning interval. This means that BIND 8 and 9 name servers
tend to use less memory for caching than a BIND 4 server in the same
role. On the other hand, the cleaning process takes CPU time, and on
very slow or very busy name servers, you may not want it running
every hour.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1710" />By default, the cleaning
interval is 60 minutes. You can tune the interval with the
<em class="emphasis">cleaning-interval</em> substatement to the
<em class="emphasis">options</em> statement. For example:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	cleaning-interval 120;
};</pre></blockquote>


sets the cleaning interval to 120 minutes. To turn off cache cleaning
entirely, set the cleaning interval to zero.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.3.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.3.2. Interface interval</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1711" /><a name="INDEX-1712" /><a name="INDEX-1713" />We've said
already that BIND, by default, listens on all of a host's
network interfaces. BIND 8 and 9 name servers are actually smart
enough to notice when a network interface on the host they're
running on comes up or goes down. To do this, they periodically scan
the host's network interfaces. This happens once each interface
interval, which is 60 minutes by default. If you know that the host
your name server runs on has no dynamic network interfaces, you can
disable scanning for new interfaces to avoid the unnecessary hourly
overhead by setting the interface interval to
zero:<a name="INDEX-1714" /></p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	interface-interval 0;
};</pre></blockquote>


On the other hand, if your host brings up or tears down network
interfaces more often than every hour, you may want to reduce the
interval.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-10-SECT-12.3.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.12.3.3. Statistics interval</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1715" />Okay,
adjusting the statistics interval -- the frequency with which the
BIND 8 name server dumps statistics to the statistics
file -- won't have much effect on performance. But it fits
better here, with the other maintenance intervals, than anywhere else
in the book.</p><p>


The syntax of the <em class="emphasis">statistics-interval</em>
substatement is exactly analogous to the other maintenance
intervals:<a name="INDEX-1716" /></p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	statistics-interval 60;
};</pre></blockquote>


And as with the other maintenance intervals, the default is 60
minutes and a setting of zero disables the periodic dumping of
statistics. Because BIND 9 doesn't write statistics to
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em>, it doesn't have a configurable
statistics interval either.<a name="INDEX-1717" /> <a name="INDEX-1718" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">10.12.4. TTLs</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1719" />
<a name="INDEX-1720" />Internally, BIND has trimmed TTL values
on <a name="INDEX-1721" />cached records to reasonable values
for some time. BIND 8 and 9 name servers make the limits
configurable.</p><p>


In BIND 8.2 or later name servers, you can limit the TTL on cached
negative information with the
<em class="emphasis">max-ncache-ttl</em><a name="INDEX-1722" /> <em class="emphasis">options
</em>substatement. This was designed as a safety net for people
who upgraded to 8.2 and its new negative caching scheme (RFC 2308 and
all that, described in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>). This new name
server caches negative information according to the last field of the
zone's SOA record, and many zone admins still use that field
for the default TTL for the zone -- probably much too long for
negative information. So a prudent name server administrator can use
a substatement like:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	max-ncache-ttl 3600;  // 3600 seconds is one hour
};</pre></blockquote>


to trim larger negative caching TTLs to one hour. The default is
10800 seconds (three hours). Without this precaution, it's
possible that someone looking up a brand-new record could get a
negative answer (maybe because the new record hadn't yet
reached the zone's slaves), and her name server would cache
that answer for an inordinately long time, rendering the record
unresolvable.</p><p>


BIND 9 name servers also let you configure the upper limit of the TTL
on cached records with the <em class="emphasis">max-cache-ttl
</em>substatement. The default is one week. BIND 8 name servers
trim TTLs to one week, too, but they don't let you configure
the limit.</p><p>


Finally, there's what's referred to as the <em class="emphasis">lame
TTL</em><a name="INDEX-1723" />
<a name="INDEX-1724" />, which
isn't really a TTL at all. Instead, it's the amount of
time your name server remembers that a given remote name server
isn't authoritative for a zone that's delegated to it.
This prevents your name server from wasting valuable time and
resources asking that name server for information about a domain name
it knows nothing about. BIND 8 name servers after 8.2 and BIND 9 name
servers newer than 9.1.0 let you tune the lame TTL with the
<em class="emphasis">lame-ttl options</em> substatement. The default lame
TTL is 600 seconds (10 minutes), with a maximum of 30 minutes. You
can even turn off the caching of lame name servers with a value of
zero, though that strikes us as a Very Bad Thing.<a name="INDEX-1725" /> <a name="INDEX-1726" /></p><p>
