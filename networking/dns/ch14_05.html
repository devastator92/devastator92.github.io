<h2 class="sect1">14.5. Interoperability and Version Problems</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2215" /> <a name="INDEX-2216" />With the move to BIND 9 and the
introduction of Microsoft DNS Server, more interoperability problems
are cropping up between name servers. There are also a handful of
problems unique to one version or another of BIND or the underlying
operating system. Many of these are easy to spot and correct, and we
would be remiss if we didn't cover them.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.1. Zone Transfer Fails Because of Proprietary WINS Record</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2217" /><a name="INDEX-2218" /><a name="INDEX-2219" />When a Microsoft DNS Server is
configured to consult a WINS server for names it can't find in
a given zone, it inserts a special record into the zone data file.
The record looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">@   IN   WINS   &amp;IP address of WINS server</pre></blockquote>


Unfortunately, WINS is not a standard record type in the IN class.
Consequently, if there are BIND slaves that transfer this zone,
they'll choke on the WINS record and refuse to load the zone:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">May 23 15:58:43 terminator named-xfer[386]: "fx.movie.edu IN 65281" - unknown type (65281)</pre></blockquote>


The workaround for this is to configure the Microsoft DNS Server to
filter out the proprietary record before transferring the zone. You
do this by selecting the zone in the left-hand side of the DNS
Manager screen, right-clicking on it, and selecting
<em class="emphasis">Properties</em>. Click on the <em class="emphasis">WINS
Lookup</em> tab in the resulting <em class="emphasis">Zone
Properties</em> window, shown in <a href="ch14_05.html#dns4-CHP-14-FIG-1">Figure 14-1</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-14-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="286" alt="Figure 14-1" src="figs/dns4_1401.gif" width="348" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 14-1. Zone Properties window</h4>

Checking <em class="emphasis">Settings only affect local server</em> will
filter out the WINS record for that zone. However, if there are any
Microsoft DNS Server slaves, they won't see the record either,
even though they could use it.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.2. Name Server Reports "No NS Record for SOA MNAME"</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2220" /><a name="INDEX-2221" /><a name="INDEX-2222" />You'll see this error only on BIND
8.1 servers:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">May 8 03:44:38 terminator named[11680]: no NS RR for SOA MNAME "movie.edu" in
     zone "movie.edu"</pre></blockquote>


The 8.1 server was a real stickler about the first field in the SOA
record. Remember that one? In <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, we said
that it was, by convention, the domain name of the primary master
name server for the zone. BIND 8.1 assumes it is and checks for a
corresponding NS record pointing the zone's domain name to the
server in that field. If there's no such NS record, BIND emits
that error message. It will also prevent NOTIFY messages from working
correctly. The solution is either to change your MNAME field to the
domain name of a name server listed in an NS record or to upgrade to
a newer version of BIND 8. Upgrading is the better option since BIND
8.1 is so old. The check was removed at BIND 8.1.1.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.3. Name Server Reports "Too Many Open Files"</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2223" /><a name="INDEX-2224" />On hosts with many IP addresses or a low
limit on the maximum number of files a user can open, BIND will
report:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Dec 12 11:52:06 terminator named[7770]: socket(SOCK_RAW): Too many open files</pre></blockquote>


and die.</p><p>


Since BIND tries to <em class="emphasis">bind( )</em> to
and listen on every network interface on the host, it may run out of
file descriptors. This is especially common on hosts that use lots of
virtual interfaces, often in support of web hosting. The possible
solutions are:</p><p>


<ul><li>Use name-based virtual hosting, which doesn't require
additional IP addresses.</p></li><li>Configure your BIND 8 or 9 name server to listen on only one or a few
of the host's network interfaces using the
<em class="emphasis">listen-on</em> substatement. If <em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em> is the host
we're having this problem with, the following:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
listen-on { 192.249.249.3; };
};</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>

<ul><li>will tell<em class="filename"> </em><em class="emphasis">named</em> on
<em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em> to
<em class="emphasis">bind( )</em> only to the IP address 192.249.249.3.</p></li><li>Reconfigure your operating system to allow a process to open more
file descriptors concurrently.</p></li></ul>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.4. Resolver Reports "Looked for PTR, Found CNAME"</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2225" /><a name="INDEX-2226" /><a name="INDEX-2227" /><a name="INDEX-2228" />This is another problem related
to BIND's strictness. On some lookups, the resolver logs:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Sep 24 10:40:11 terminator syslog: gethostby*.getanswer: asked for
     "37.103.74.204.in-addr.arpa IN PTR", got type "CNAME"
Sep 24 10:40:11 terminator syslog: gethostby*.getanswer: asked for
     "37.103.74.204.in-addr.arpa", got "37.32/27.103.74.204.in-addr.arpa"</pre></blockquote>


What happened here is that the resolver asked the name server to
reverse map the IP address 204.74.103.37 to a domain name. The server
did, but in the process found that <em class="emphasis">37.103.74.204.in-addr.arpa</em> was actually
an alias for <em class="emphasis">37.32/27.103.74.204.in-addr.arpa</em>.
That's almost certainly because the folks who run <em class="emphasis">103.74.204.in-addr.arpa</em> are using the
scheme we described in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Parenting"</a>, to delegate part
of their namespace. The BIND 4.9.3-BETA resolver, however,
doesn't understand that and flags it as an error, thinking it
didn't get the domain name or the type it was after. And,
believe it or not, some operating systems ship with the BIND
4.9.3-BETA resolver as their system resolver.</p><p>


The only solution to this problem is to upgrade to a newer version of
the BIND resolver.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.5. Name Server Startup Fails Because UDP Checksums Disabled</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2229" /><a name="INDEX-2230" /><a name="INDEX-2231" />On some hosts running SunOS 4.1.x,
you'll see this error:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Sep 24 10:40:11 terminator named[7770]: ns_udp checksums NOT turned on: exiting</pre></blockquote>


<em class="filename">named</em> checked to make sure UDP checksumming was
turned on on this system, and it wasn't, so
<em class="filename">named</em> exited. <em class="filename">named</em> is
insistent on UDP checksumming for good reason: it makes copious use
of UDP and needs those UDP datagrams to arrive unmolested.</p><p>


The solution to this problem is to enable UDP checksums on your
system. The BIND distribution has documentation on that in
<em class="filename">shres/sunos/INSTALL</em> and
<em class="filename">shres/sunos/ISSUES </em>(in the BIND 4 distribution)
or <em class="filename">src/port/sunos/shres/ISSUES </em>(in the BIND 8
distribution).</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.6. SunOS Resolver Is Configured, but Host Doesn't Use DNS</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2232" />This problem is
implementation-specific. Some administrators on SunOS 4 hosts
configure their resolvers with <em class="filename">resolv.conf </em>and
naively assume that <em class="filename">ping</em>,
<em class="filename">telnet</em>, and their brethren should work right
away. However, in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring Hosts"</a> we discussed how SunOS
4 implements the resolver (in <em class="filename">ypserv</em>, you may
recall). If the host isn't running NIS, configuring the
resolver won't do it. The administrator will either have to set
up at least an empty <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> map or replace the
resolver routines. For details on both of these options, see <a href="ch06_01.html#dns4-CHP-6-SECT-1">Section 6.1, "The Resolver"</a> in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring Hosts"</a>.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.7. Other Name Servers Don't Cache Your Negative Answers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2233" /><a name="INDEX-2234" />You'd
need a keen eye to notice this problem, and, if you're running
BIND 8, you'd also have to have turned off an important feature
to have caused the problem. If you're running BIND 9, though,
the feature is turned off by default. If you're running a BIND
8 or 9 name server and other resolvers and servers seem to ignore
your server's cached negative responses,
<a name="INDEX-2235" /><em class="emphasis">auth-nxdomain</em>
is probably off.<a name="INDEX-2236" /></p><p>


<em class="emphasis">auth-nxdomain</em> is an <em class="emphasis">options</em>
substatement that tells a BIND 8 or 9 name server to flag cached
negative responses as authoritative, even though they're not.
That is, if your name server has cached the fact that <em class="emphasis">titanic.movie.edu</em> does not exist from
the authoritative <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>
name servers, <em class="emphasis">auth-nxdomain</em> tells your server to
pass along that cached response to resolvers and servers that query
it as though it were the authoritative name server for <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>.</p><p>


The reason this feature is sometimes necessary is that some name
servers check to make sure that negative responses (like an NXDOMAIN
return code or no records with a NOERROR return code) are marked
authoritative. In the days before negative caching, negative
responses <em class="emphasis">had</em> to be authoritative, so this was a
sensible sanity check. With the advent of negative caching, however,
a negative response could come from the cache. To make sure that
older servers don't ignore such answers, though, or consider
them errors, BIND 8 and 9 let you falsely flag those responses as
authoritative. In fact, that's the default behavior for a BIND
8 name server, so you shouldn't see remote queriers ignoring
your BIND 8 server's negative responses unless you've
explicitly turned off <em class="emphasis">auth-nxdomain</em>. BIND 9 name
servers, on the other hand, have <em class="emphasis">auth-nxdomain</em>
offby default, so queriers may ignore their
responses even if you haven't touched the config file.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-14-SECT-5.8" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.5.8. TTL Not Set</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2237" />As we mentioned in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, <a name="INDEX-2238" />RFC 2308 was published just before BIND 8.2
was released. RFC 2308 changed the semantics of the last field in the
SOA record to be the negative caching TTL and introduced a new
control statement, $TTL, to set the default TTL for a zone data file.</p><p>


If you upgrade to a BIND 8 name server newer than 8.2 without adding
the necessary $TTL control statements to your zone data files,
you'll see messages like this one in your name server's
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em> output:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Sep 26 19:34:39 terminator named[22116]: Zone "movie.edu" (file db.movie.edu): No 
default TTL ($TTL &lt;value&gt;) set, using SOA minimum instead</pre></blockquote>


BIND 8 generously assumes that you just haven't read RFC 2308
yet and is content to use the last field of the SOA record as both
the zone's default TTL and its negative caching TTL. BIND 9,
however, isn't so forgiving:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Sep 26 19:35:54 terminator named[22124]: dns_master_load: db.movie.edu:7: no TTL 
specified
Sep 26 19:35:54 terminator named[22124]: dns_zone_load: zone movie.edu/IN: 
database db.movie.edu: dns_db_load failed: no ttl
Sep 26 19:35:54 terminator named[22124]: loading zones: no ttl
Sep 26 19:35:54 terminator named[22124]: exiting (due to fatal error)</pre></blockquote>


So before upgrading to BIND 9, be sure that you add the necessary
$TTL control statements.<a name="INDEX-2239" /> <a name="INDEX-2240" /></p><p>
