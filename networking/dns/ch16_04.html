<h2 class="sect1">16.4. Dialup Connections</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2387" /> <a name="INDEX-2388" /> <a name="INDEX-2389" />Another <a name="INDEX-2390" />relatively <a name="INDEX-2391" />recent development in networking
that presents a challenge to DNS is the dialup Internet connection.
When the Internet was young, and DNS was born, there was no such
thing as a dialup connection. With the enormous explosion in the
Internet's popularity and the propagation of Internet service
providers who offer dialup Internet connectivity to the masses, a
whole new breed of problems with name service has been introduced.</p><p>


The basic goal when setting up DNS to work with dialup is to enable
every host in your network to resolve the domain names of every host
it needs to access. (Of course, when your connection to the Internet
is down, your hosts probably don't need to resolve Internet
domain names.) If you're using dial-on-demand, there's
the additional goal of minimizing unnecessary dialouts: if
you're looking up the domain name of a host on your local
network, that shouldn't require your router to bring up a
connection to the Internet.</p><p>


We'll separate dialup connections into two categories: manual
dialup, by which we mean a connection to the Internet that must be
brought up by a user; and dial-on-demand, which implies the use of a
device -- often a router, but sometimes just a host running Linux
or another server operating system -- to connect to the Internet
automatically whenever hosts generate traffic bound for the Internet.
We'll also describe two scenarios for each category of dialup:
one in which you have just one host dialing up a connection to the
Internet, and one in which you have a small network of hosts dialing
up a connection. Before we talk about these scenarios, though,
let's discuss what causes dialouts and how to avoid them.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.1. What Causes Dialouts</h3>


Many users, particularly in Europe, where ISDN is popular, connect to
the Internet via dial-on-demand connections. Nearly all of these
users want to minimize, if not completely prevent, unnecessary
connections to the Internet. Connection setup is often more expensive
than successive minutes, and always takes time.</p><p>


BIND name servers, unfortunately, aren't terribly well suited
to running behind dial-on-demand connections. They periodically send
system queries to look up the current list of root name servers, even
when the name server isn't resolving domain names. And the
operation of the search list can cause the name server to query
remote name servers. For example, say your local domain name is
<em class="emphasis">tinyoffice.megacorp.com</em> and
you have a local name server authoritative for that zone. Your
default search list, on some resolvers, might include:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">tinyoffice.megacorp.com
megacorp.com</pre></blockquote>


Let's say you try to FTP to one of your local systems,
<em class="emphasis">deadbeef.tinyoffice.megacorp.com</em>, but
you misspell it <em class="emphasis">deadbeer</em> :</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% ftp deadbeer</pre></blockquote>


Because of your search list, your resolver would first look up
<em class="emphasis">deadbeer.tinyoffice.megacorp.com</em>. Your
local name server, authoritative for the <em class="emphasis">tinyoffice.megacorp.com</em> zone, can tell
that domain name doesn't exist. But then your resolver appends
the second domain name in the search list and looks up <em class="emphasis">deadbeer.megacorp.com</em>. To figure out
whether that domain name exists, your name server needs to query a
<em class="emphasis">megacorp.com</em> server, which
will require bringing up the dial-on-demand link.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.2. Avoiding Dialouts</h3>


There are several general techniques that will help you minimize
unnecessary dialouts. The first, and probably simplest, is to run a
version of BIND that supports negative caching (which means anything
newer than BIND 4.9.5, but we certainly prefer BIND 8 and 9). That
way, if you mistakenly put <em class="emphasis">deadbeer</em>into a configuration file, your name server looks up
<em class="emphasis">deadbeer.megacorp.com</em> once,
and then caches the fact that the domain name doesn't exist for
the duration of <em class="emphasis">megacorp.com</em>'s negative caching
TTL.</p><p>


Another technique is to use a minimal search list. If your local
domain name is <em class="emphasis">tinyoffice.megacorp.com</em>, you could make
do with a search list of just <em class="emphasis">tinyoffice.megacorp.com</em>. That way, a
typo won't cause a dialout.</p><p>


Using a modern resolver is also important. The default search list
for a post-BIND 4.9 resolver is just the local domain name, which
qualifies as "minimal" in our book. And a modern resolver
knows to try a domain name with dots as-is, even if it doesn't
end in a dot.</p><p>


Finally, you can use other naming services, such as
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>, for local name resolution and
configure your resolvers to use DNS only if a name cannot be found in
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>. As long as you keep the names of all
your local hosts in <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>, you won't
need to worry about needless connections to the Internet.</p><p>


Now let's apply these techniques to our scenarios.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.3. Manual Dialup with One Host</h3>


The easiest way to deal with the simple <a name="INDEX-2392" />dialup
scenario is to configure your host's resolver to use a name
server provided by your Internet service provider (ISP). Most ISPs
run name servers for their subscribers' use. If you're
not sure whether your ISP provides name servers for your use, or if
you don't know what their IP addresses are, check their web
site, send them email, or give them a call.</p><p>


Some operating systems, such as Windows 95, 98, and NT, let you
define a set of name servers for use with a particular dialup
provider. So, for example, you can configure one set of name servers
to use when you dial up UUNet and another to use when you dial up
your office. This is useful if you dial in to multiple ISPs.</p><p>


This configuration is usually adequate for most casual dialup users.
Name resolution will fail unless the dialup connection is up, but
that's not likely to be a problem, since there's no use
for Internet name service without Internet connectivity.</p><p>


Some of you, however, may want to run a name server when your dialup
connection is active. It could help your performance by caching
domain names you look up frequently, for example. This is easy to set
up with a Unix-like operating system such as Linux: you'll
typically use a script like <em class="filename">ifup</em> to bring up
your dialup connection and <em class="filename">ifdown</em> to bring it
down. If that's the case, there are probably also scripts
called <em class="filename">ifup-post </em>and <em class="filename">ifdown-post
</em>that <em class="filename">ifup</em> and
<em class="filename">ifdown</em> call, respectively, after they've
done most of their work. You can start <em class="filename">named</em> as
<em class="filename">named</em> or with <em class="filename">ndc start </em>in
<em class="filename">ifup-post</em>, and shut it down with <em class="filename">ndc
stop</em> or <em class="filename">rndc stop</em> in
<em class="filename">ifdown-post</em>. About the only other thing
you'd need to do is set your local domain name in
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>. The default resolver behavior,
querying a name server on the local host, should do fine both when
the name server's running and when it's not.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.4. Manual Dialup with Multiple Hosts</h3>


The simplest solution to use with the multiple host/manual dialup
scenario is similar to the resolver-only configuration. You can
configure your resolvers to use your ISP's name servers, but
also configure the resolvers to check <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>
(or NIS, if you go for that sort of thing)
<em class="emphasis">before</em> querying a name server. Then make sure
your <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> file contains the names of all
the hosts on your local network.</p><p>


If you'd like to run a name server locally, you only need to
modify this configuration slightly: configure the resolvers to use
your local name server instead of your ISP's. This will give
you the benefits of local caching, but local name resolution will
work (via <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>) even when your connection
to the Internet is down. You may as well start and stop the local
name server from <em class="filename">ifup-post</em> and
<em class="filename">ifdown-post</em>, as described earlier.</p><p>


For those of you who really want to use DNS for <em class="emphasis">all
</em>name resolution, you can forgo the <em class="filename">/etc/hosts
</em>file and create forward-mapping and reverse-mapping zones
on your local name server for your hosts. You should trim your
resolvers' search lists to the bare minimum, though, to
minimize the chance that you'll induce your name server to look
up some wacky remote domain name.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.5. Dial-on-Demand with One Host </h3>


If you have a single host with a dial-on-demand connection to the
Internet, your simplest solution is still a resolver-only
configuration. Configure your resolver to use your ISP's name
servers, and when the resolver needs to look up a domain name,
it'll query one of those name servers and bring up the link. If
there are some domain names that your host looks up routinely as part
of "housekeeping," like <em class="emphasis">localhost</em> or <em class="emphasis">1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</em>, you can add
those to <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> and configure your resolver
to check <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> before querying a name
server.</p><p>


If you'd like to run a name server locally, make sure it is
able to map <em class="emphasis">localhost</em> and
<em class="emphasis">1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</em> to
127.0.0.1 and <em class="emphasis">localhost</em>,
respectively, and trim your search list to the minimum.</p><p>


If your name server brings up the link more than you think it should,
try turning on query logging (with <em class="emphasis">options query-log
</em>on a BIND 4.9 name server, <em class="filename">ndc
querylog</em> on a BIND 4.9 or 8 name server, or <em class="filename">rndc
querylog</em> on a BIND 9.1.0 name server) and look for the
domain names that bring up the link. If many of them are in a single
zone, you might consider configuring your local name server as a
slave for that zone. At least that way, you'll bring up the
link at most only once per refresh interval to resolve domain names
in the zone.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.6. Dial-on-Demand with Multiple Hosts</h3>


The simplest solution in this scenario is exactly the same as the
first solution we described in <a href="ch16_04.html#dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.4">Section 16.4.4, "Manual Dialup with Multiple Hosts"</a>: a resolver-only configuration with the
resolvers configured to check <em class="filename">/etc/hosts </em>before
querying a name server. As with all dial-on-demand configurations,
you'll want to trim your search list down.</p><p>


Alternatively, you could try one of the two variants: running a local
name server and using it as a backup to
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>, or creating forward- and
reverse-mapping zones for the local hosts on the local name server.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-4.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.7. Running Authoritative Name Servers over Dial-on-Demand</h3>

This may sound like a silly subject to some of you -- who would
run an <a name="INDEX-2393" /> <a name="INDEX-2394" />authoritative name server
behind a <a name="INDEX-2395" />dial-on-demand connection? -- but
in some parts of the world, where bandwidth and Internet connectivity
aren't easy to come by, this is a necessity. And, believe it or
not, BIND provides a mechanism to accommodate such name servers.</p><p>


If you run an authoritative name server behind a dial-on-demand link,
you want to concentrate zone maintenance activities into as short a
window as possible. If your name server is authoritative for 100
zones, you'd rather not have zone refresh timers popping every
few minutes and the resulting SOA queries bringing up the
dial-on-demand link over and over again.</p><p>


With BIND 8.2 and newer name servers and BIND 9.1.0 and later name
servers, you can configure a <em class="firstterm">heartbeat
interval</em><a name="INDEX-2396" /> <a name="INDEX-2397" />.
The <a name="INDEX-2398" />heartbeat interval is how frequently
you'd like your name server to bring up its dial-on-demand
connection, in minutes:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	heartbeat-interval 180;      // 3 hours
};</pre></blockquote>


The default is 60 minutes, and you can disable zone maintenance by
setting the interval to zero.</p><p>


If you then mark one or more of your zones as dialup zones, the name
server will try to concentrate all maintenance of that zone into a
short period and to perform the maintenance no more often than the
heartbeat interval. For a slave zone, that means inhibiting the
normal refresh timer (even ignoring the refresh interval, if
it's smaller than the heartbeat interval!) and querying the
master for the zone's SOA record only at the heartbeat
interval. For a master zone, that means sending out NOTIFY messages,
which will presumably bring up the dial-on-demand link and trigger a
refresh on the slaves.</p><p>


To mark all of a name server's zones as dialup zones, use the
<em class="emphasis">dialup</em><a name="INDEX-2399" /> substatement in an
<em class="emphasis">options</em> statement:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	heartbeat-interval 60;
	dialup yes;
};</pre></blockquote>


To mark a single zone as a dialup zone, use the
<em class="emphasis">dialup</em> substatement to the <em class="emphasis">zone
</em>statement:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">zone "movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db.movie.edu";
	dialup yes;
};</pre></blockquote>


Dialup zones are also useful in another, perhaps unintended way: on
name servers that serve as slaves for thousands of zones. Some ISPs
provide slave service on a large scale but get bitten by miscreants
who set their zone's refresh intervals far too low. Their name
servers end up swamped with sending out SOA queries for those zones.
By configuring all the zones as dialup zones and setting the
heartbeat interval to something reasonable, ISPs<a name="INDEX-2400" /> can<a name="INDEX-2401" />
prevent<a name="INDEX-2402" /> <a name="INDEX-2403" /> <a name="INDEX-2404" /> this.</p><p>
