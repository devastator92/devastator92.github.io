<a name="INDEX-1953" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1954" /></a>To be proficient at troubleshooting name
server problems, you'll need a troubleshooting tool to send DNS
queries, one that gives you complete control. We'll cover
<em class="filename">nslookup </em>in this chapter because it's
distributed with BIND and with many vendors' operating systems.
That doesn't mean it's the best DNS troubleshooting tool
available, though. <em class="filename">nslookup</em> has its
faults -- so many, in fact, that it's now deprecated
(geekish for "officially out of favor") in the BIND 9
distribution. We'll cover it anyway, since it's
pervasive. We'll also cover <em class="filename">dig</em>, which
provides similar functionality and doesn't suffer from
<em class="filename">nslookup</em>'s deficiencies.</p><p>


Note that this chapter isn't comprehensive; there are aspects
of <em class="filename">nslookup </em>and <em class="filename">dig (</em>mostly
obscure and seldom used) that we won't cover. You can always
consult the manual pages for those.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">12.1. Is nslookup a Good Tool?</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1955" /></a>Much of the
time, you'll use <em class="filename">nslookup</em> to send queries
in the same way the resolver sends them. Sometimes, though,
you'll use <em class="filename">nslookup</em> to query other name
servers as a name server would instead. The way you use it will
depend on the problem you're trying to debug. You might wonder,
"How accurately does <em class="filename">nslookup</em> emulate a
resolver or a name server? Does <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
actually use the BIND resolver library routines?" No,
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> uses its own routines for querying name
servers, but those routines are based on the resolver routines.
Consequently, <em class="filename">nslookup</em>'s behavior is very
similar to the resolver's behavior, but it does differ
slightly. We'll point out some of those differences. As for
emulating name server behavior, <em class="filename">nslookup</em> allows
us to query another server with the same query message that a name
server would use, but the retransmission scheme is quite different.
Like a name server, though, <em class="filename">nslookup</em> can
transfer a copy of the zone data. So <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
doesn't emulate either the resolver or the name server exactly,
but it does emulate them well enough to make a decent troubleshooting
tool. Let's delve into those differences we alluded to.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.1. Multiple Servers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1956" /></a><em class="filename">nslookup</em>
talks to only one name server at a time. This is the biggest
difference between <em class="filename">nslookup</em>'s behavior and
the resolver's behavior. The resolver makes use of each
<em class="emphasis">nameserver</em> directive in
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>. If there are two
<em class="emphasis">nameserver</em> directives in
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em><a name="INDEX-1957" /></a>, the
resolver tries the first name server, then the second, then the
first, then the second, until it receives a response or gives up. The
resolver does this for every query. On the other hand,
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> tries the first name server in
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em> and keeps retrying until it finally
gives up on the first name server and tries the second. Once it gets
a response, it locks onto that server and doesn't try the next.
However, you <em class="emphasis">want</em> your troubleshooting tool to
talk to only one name server so you can reduce the number of
variables when analyzing a problem. If <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
used more than one name server, you wouldn't have as much
control over your troubleshooting session. So talking to only one
server is the right thing for a troubleshooting tool to do.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.2. Timeouts</h3>


The
<em class="filename">nslookup</em><a name="INDEX-1958" /></a> timeouts match the resolver timeouts when
the resolver is querying only one name server. A name server's
timeouts, however, are based on how quickly the remote server
answered the last query, a dynamic measure.
<em class="filename">nslookup</em>'s timeouts will never match a
name server's timeouts, but that's not a problem either.
When you're querying remote name servers with
<em class="filename">nslookup</em>, you probably only care what the
response was, not how long it took.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.3. The Search List</h3>


<em class="filename">nslookup</em><a name="INDEX-1959" /></a>
implements the search list just as the resolver code does. Versions
of <em class="filename">nslookup</em> shipped with pre-BIND 4.9 name
servers tend to use a "full" search list: the local
domain name and all ancestor domain names with at least two labels.
Versions of <em class="filename">nslookup</em> shipped with BIND 4.9 and
later name servers use an abridged search list that includes just the
local domain name. We'll show you how to determine your type of
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> later, in case you're not sure.</p><p>


Name servers don't implement search lists, so, to act like a
name server, the <em class="filename">nslookup</em> search function must
be turned off -- more on that later.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-1.4" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.4. Zone Transfers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1960" /></a><em class="filename">nslookup</em> does zone
transfers just like a name server. Unlike a name server, however,
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> does not check SOA
<a name="INDEX-1961" /></a>serial numbers before pulling the zone
data; if you want to do that, you'll have to do it manually.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-1.5" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.5. Using NIS and /etc/hosts</h3>


This last point doesn't compare <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
to the resolver or name server but to ways of looking up names in
general. As distributed from the Internet Software Consortium,
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> uses only DNS; it won't use
<a name="INDEX-1962" /></a>NIS
or <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>. Most applications can use DNS,
NIS, or <a name="INDEX-1963" /></a><em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>, depending
on how the system is configured. Don't count on
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> to help you find your lookup problem
unless your host is really configured to use name servers.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-93">[93]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-93" /></a>[93]Or your vendor's <em class="filename">nslookup </em>has been
enhanced to query NIS servers and check
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>, like the one in HP-UX.</p><p>
