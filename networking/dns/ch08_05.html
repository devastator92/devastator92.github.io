<h2 class="sect1">8.5. Planning for Disasters</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1387" />It's
<a name="INDEX-1388" />
<a name="INDEX-1389" />a fact of life on a network that things go
wrong. Hardware fails, software has bugs, and people very
occasionally make mistakes. Sometimes this results in minor
inconveniences, like having a few users lose connections. Sometimes
the results are catastrophic and involve the loss of important data
and valuable jobs.</p><p>


Because the Domain Name System relies so heavily on the network, it
is vulnerable to network outages. Thankfully, the design of DNS takes
into account the imperfection of networks: it allows for multiple,
redundant name servers, retransmission of queries, retrying zone
transfers, and so on.</p><p>


The Domain Name System doesn't protect itself from every
conceivable calamity, though. There are types of network
failures -- some of them quite common -- that DNS doesn't
or can't protect against. But with a small investment of time
and money, you can minimize the threat of these outages.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.5.1. Outages</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1390" />
<a name="INDEX-1391" />Power outages, for example, are
relatively common in many parts of the world. In some parts of the
U.S., thunderstorms or tornadoes may cause a site to lose power, or
to have only intermittent power, for an extended period. Elsewhere,
typhoons, volcanoes, or construction work may interrupt your
electrical service.</p><p>


If all your hosts are down, of course, you don't need name
service. Quite often, however, sites have problems when power is
<em class="emphasis">restored</em>. Following our recommendations, they
run their name servers on file servers and big multiuser machines.
And when the power comes up, those machines are naturally the last to
boot -- because all those disks need to be <em class="filename">fsck
</em>'d first! Which means that all the on-site hosts
that are quick to boot do so without the benefit of name service.</p><p>


This can cause all sorts of wonderful problems, depending on how your
hosts' startup files are written. Unix hosts often execute some
variant of:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">/usr/sbin/ifconfig lan0 inet `hostname` netmask 255.255.128.0 up
/usr/sbin/route add default site-router 1</pre></blockquote>


to bring up their network interface and add a default route. Using
host names in the commands
(<tt class="literal">`</tt><em class="emphasis">hostname</em><tt class="literal">`</tt>
expands to the local host name and <em class="emphasis">site-router</em>
is the name of the local router) is admirable for two reasons:</p><p>


<ul><li>It lets the administrators change the router's IP address
without changing all the startup files on-site.</p></li><li>It lets the administrators change the host's IP address by
changing the IP address in only one file.</p></li></ul>
Unfortunately, the <a name="INDEX-1392" /><em class="filename">route</em> command fails
without name service. The
<em class="filename">ifconfig</em><a name="INDEX-1393" /> command fails only if the local
host's name and IP address don't appear in the
host's <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> file, so it's a
good idea to leave at least that data in each host's
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>.</p><p>


By the time the startup sequence reaches the
<em class="filename">route</em> command, the network interface will be up,
and the host will try to use name service to map the name of the
router to an IP address. And since the host has no default route
until the <em class="filename">route</em> command is executed, the only
name servers it can reach are those on the local subnet.</p><p>


If the booting host can reach a working name server on its local
subnet, it can execute the <em class="filename">route</em> command
successfully. Quite often, however, one or more of the name servers
it can reach aren't yet running. What happens then depends on
the contents of <a name="INDEX-1394" /><em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>.</p><p>


BIND <a name="INDEX-1395" />resolvers fall back to the host table only
if there is just one name server listed in <em class="filename">resolv.conf
</em>(or if no name server is listed, and the resolver defaults
to using a name server on the local host). If only one name server is
configured, the resolver queries it, and if the network returns an
error each time the resolver sends a query, the resolver falls back
to searching the host table. The errors that cause the resolver to
fall back include:</p><p>


<ul><li>Receipt of an <a name="INDEX-1396" />ICMP
<a name="INDEX-1397" />port
unreachable message</p></li><li>Receipt of an ICMP <a name="INDEX-1398" />network unreachable message</p></li><li>Inability to send the UDP packet (e.g., because networking is not yet
running on the local host)<a href="#FOOTNOTE-65">[65]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-65" />[65]Check <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring Hosts"</a>, for vendor-specific enhancements to and
variants of this resolver algorithm.</p><p>

</blockquote></li></ul>
If the host running the one configured name server isn't
running at all, though, the resolver doesn't receive any
errors. The name server is effectively a black hole. After about 75
seconds of trying, the resolver just times out and returns a null
answer to the application that called it. Only if the name server
host has actually started networking -- but not yet started the
name server -- does the resolver get an error: an ICMP port
unreachable message.</p><p>


Overall, the single name server configuration does work if you have
name servers available on each network, but not as elegantly as we
might like. If the local name server hasn't come up when a host
on its network reboots, the <em class="filename">route </em>command fails.</p><p>


This may seem awkward, but it's not nearly as bad as what
happens with multiple name servers. With multiple servers listed in
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>, BIND <em class="emphasis">never
</em>falls back to the host table after the primary network
interface has been <em class="filename">ifconfig </em>'d. The
resolver simply loops through the name servers, querying them until
one answers or the 75-plus second timeout is reached.</p><p>


This is especially problematic during bootup. If none of the
configured name servers is available, the resolver times out without
returning an IP address, and adding the default route fails.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.5.2. Recommendations</h3>


Our recommendation, as primitive as it sounds, is to hardcode the
<a name="INDEX-1399" />IP address of the
default router into the startup file or an external file (many
systems use<a name="INDEX-1400" /><a name="INDEX-1401" /> <em class="filename">/etc/defaultrouter</em>).
This ensures that your host's networking starts correctly.</p><p>


An alternative is to list just a single, reliable name server on your
host's local network in <em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>. This
allows you to use the name of the default router in the startup file,
as long as you make sure that the router's name appears in
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts </em>(in case your reliable name server
isn't running when the host reboots). Of course, if the host
running the reliable name server isn't running when your host
reboots, all bets are off. You won't fall back to
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em> because there won't be any
networking running to return an error to your host.</p><p>


If your vendor's version of BIND allows configuration of the
order in which services are queried or falls back from DNS to
<em class="filename">/etc/hosts </em>if DNS doesn't find an answer,
take advantage of it! In the former case, you can configure the
resolver to check <em class="filename">/etc/hosts </em>first, and then
keep a "stub" <em class="filename">/etc/hosts </em>file on
each host, including the default router and the local host's
name. In the latter situation, just make sure such a
"stub" <em class="filename">/etc/hosts </em>exists; no other
configuration should be necessary.</p><p>


A last, promising prospect is to do away with setting the default
route manually by using <a name="INDEX-1402" /><em class="firstterm">ICMP Router Discovery
Messages</em>. This extension to the <a name="INDEX-1403" />
<a name="INDEX-1404" />ICMP protocol, described in RFC 1256,
uses broadcast or multicast messages to dynamically discover and
advertise routers on a network. <a name="INDEX-1405" />Windows NT 4.0 supports it, though
it's disabled by default. To enable it, follow the instructions
in Knowledge Base article Q223756. Sun includes an implementation of
this protocol in recent versions of Solaris as
<em class="filename">/usr/sbin/in.rdisc,</em> and Cisco's
Internetwork Operating System (IOS) supports it too.</p><p>


And what if your default route is added correctly but the name
servers still haven't come up? This can affect
<em class="filename">sendmail</em>, NFS, and a slew of other services.
<em class="filename">sendmail </em>won't canonicalize host names
correctly without DNS, and your NFS mounts may fail.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1406" /> <a name="INDEX-1407" />The best solution to this problem is to
run a name server on a host with uninterruptible power. If you rarely
experience extended power loss, battery backup might be enough. If
your outages are longer and name service is critical to you, you
should consider an <a name="INDEX-1408" /> <a name="INDEX-1409" />uninterruptible power system
(UPS) with a generator of some kind.</p><p>


If you can't afford luxuries like these, you might just try to
track down the fastest booting host around and run a name server on
it. Hosts with filesystem journaling should boot especially quickly
since they don't need to <em class="filename">fsck</em>. Hosts with
small filesystems should boot quickly, too, since they don't
have as much filesystem to check.</p><p>


Once you've located the right host, you'll need to make
sure the host's IP address appears in the
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em> files of all the hosts that need
full-time name service. You'll probably want to list the
backed-up host last, since during normal operation hosts should use
the name server closest to them. Then, after a power failure, your
critical applications will still have name service, albeit at a small
sacrifice in performance.</p><p>
