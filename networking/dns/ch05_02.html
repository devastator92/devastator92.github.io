<h2 class="sect1">5.2. What's a Mail Exchanger, Again?</h2>


The idea of a <a name="INDEX-676" /> <a name="INDEX-677" />mail exchanger is probably new to
many of you, so let's go over it in a little more detail. A
simple analogy should help here. Imagine that a mail exchanger is an
airport, and instead of setting up MX records to instruct mailers
where to send messages, you're advising your in-laws on which
airport to fly into when they come visit you.</p><p>


Say you live in Los Gatos, California. The closest airport for your
in-laws to fly into is San Jose, the second closest is San Francisco,
and the third Oakland. (We'll ignore other factors like price
of the ticket, Bay Area traffic, etc.) Don't see the parallel?
Then picture it like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">los-gatos.ca.us.    IN    MX    1 san-jose.ca.us.
los-gatos.ca.us.    IN    MX    2 san-francisco.ca.us.
los-gatos.ca.us.    IN    MX    3 oakland.ca.us.</pre></blockquote>


The MX list is just an ordered list of destinations that tells
mailers (your in-laws) where to send messages (fly) if they want to
reach a given email destination (your house). The preference value
tells them how desirable it is to use that destination -- you can
think of it as a logical "distance" from the eventual
destination (in any units you choose), or simply as a
"top-10"-style ranking of the proximity of those mail
exchangers to the final destination.</p><p>


With this list, you're saying, "Try to fly into San Jose,
and if you can't get there, try San Francisco and Oakland, in
that order." It <em class="emphasis">also</em> says that if you
reach San Francisco, you should take a commuter flight to San Jose.
If you wind up in Oakland, you should try to get a commuter to San
Jose or at least to San Francisco.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-678" />What makes a good mail exchanger, then?
The same qualities that make a good airport:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>Size</i></dt>
<dd>You wouldn't want to fly into tiny Reid-Hillview Airport to get
to Los Gatos because the airport's not equipped to handle large
planes or many people. (You'd probably be better off landing a
big jet on Interstate 280 than at Reid-Hillview.) Likewise, you
don't want to use an emaciated, underpowered host as a mail
exchanger; it won't be able to handle the load.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Uptime</i></dt>
<dd>You know better than to fly through Denver International Airport in
the winter, right? Then you should know better than to use a host
that's rarely up or available as a mail exchanger.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Connectivity</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-679" />If your
relatives are flying in from far away, you've got to make sure
they're able to get a direct flight to at least one of the
airports in the list you give them. You can't tell them their
only choices are San Jose and Oakland if they're flying in from
Helsinki. Similarly, you've got to make sure that at least one
of your hosts' mail exchangers is reachable to anyone who might
conceivably send you mail.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Management and administration</i></dt>
<dd>How well an airport is managed has a bearing on your safety when
flying into or just through the airport, and on how easy it is to
use. Think of these factors when choosing a mail exchanger. The
privacy of your mail, the speed of its delivery during normal
operations, and how well your mail is treated when your hosts go down
all hinge upon the quality of the administrators who manage your mail
exchangers.</p></dd>

</dl>


Keep this example in mind, because we'll use it again later.</p><p>
