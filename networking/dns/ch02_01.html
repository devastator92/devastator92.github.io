<em>"... and what is the use of a book," thought Alice,
"without pictures or conversations?"</em></p><p>


<a name="INDEX-87" /></a>The
Domain Name System is basically a database of host information.
Admittedly, you get a lot with that: funny dotted names, networked
name servers, a shadowy "namespace." But keep in mind
that, in the end, the service DNS provides is information about
internet hosts.</p><p>


We've already covered some important aspects of DNS, including
its client-server architecture and the structure of the DNS database.
However, we haven't gone into much detail, and we haven't
explained the nuts and bolts of DNS's operation.</p><p>


In this chapter, we explain and illustrate the mechanisms that make
DNS work. We also introduce the terms you'll need to know to
read the rest of the book (and to converse intelligently with your
fellow zone administrators).</p><p>


First, though, let's take a more detailed look at concepts
introduced in the previous chapter. We'll try to add enough
detail to spice it up a little.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">2.1. The Domain Name Space</h2>


<a name="INDEX-88" /></a>DNS's <a name="INDEX-89" /></a> <a name="INDEX-90" /></a>distributed database is indexed by domain
names. Each domain name is essentially just a path in a large
inverted tree, called the <em class="emphasis">domain name space</em>. The
tree's hierarchical structure, shown in <a href="ch02_01.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-1">Figure 2-1</a>, is similar to the structure of the Unix
filesystem. The tree has a single root at the top.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> In the Unix filesystem, this is
called the root directory, represented by a slash (
<a name="INDEX-91" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-92" /></a>/ ). DNS simply calls it "the
<a name="INDEX-93" /></a>root."
Like a filesystem, DNS's tree can branch any number of ways at
each intersection point, or
<em class="emphasis">node</em><a name="INDEX-94" /></a>.
The depth of the tree is limited to 127 levels (a limit you're
not likely to reach).<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /></a>[7]Clearly this is a computer scientist's tree, not a
botanist's.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="271" alt="Figure 2-1" src="figs/dns4_0201.gif" width="375" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-1. The structure of the DNS namespace</h4>

<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.1.1. Domain Names</h3>


Each node in the tree has a text <a name="INDEX-95" /></a>label (without dots) that can be up to 63
characters long. A <a name="INDEX-96" /></a>null (zero-length) label is reserved for
the root. The full <em class="emphasis">domain
name</em><a name="INDEX-97" /></a>
of any node in the tree is the sequence of labels on the path from
that node to the root. Domain names are always read from the node
toward the root ("up" the tree), with dots separating the
names in the path.</p><p>


If the root node's label actually appears in a node's
domain name, the name looks as though it ends in a dot, as in
"www.oreilly.com.". (It actually ends with a
dot -- the separator -- and the root's null label.) When
the root node's label appears by itself, it is written as a
single dot (.) for convenience. Consequently, some software
interprets a <a name="INDEX-98" /></a> <a name="INDEX-99" /></a>trailing dot in a domain name to indicate
that the domain name is <em class="emphasis">absolute</em>. An
<a name="INDEX-100" /></a>absolute domain name is written relative
to the root and unambiguously specifies a node's location in
the hierarchy. An absolute domain name is also referred to as a
<a name="INDEX-101" /></a> <a name="INDEX-102" /></a> <a name="INDEX-103" /></a><em class="emphasis">fully qualified domain
name</em>, often abbreviated <em class="emphasis">FQDN</em>. Names
without trailing dots are sometimes interpreted as relative to some
domain name other than the root, just as directory names without a
leading slash are often interpreted as relative to the current
directory.</p><p>


DNS requires that <a name="INDEX-104" /></a>sibling nodes -- nodes that are
children of the same parent -- have different labels. This
restriction guarantees that a domain name uniquely identifies a
single node in the tree. The restriction isn't really a
limitation, because the labels need to be unique only among the
children, not among all the nodes in the tree. The same restriction
applies to the Unix filesystem: you can't give two sibling
directories or two files in the same directory the same name. Just as
you can't have two <em class="emphasis">hobbes.pa.ca.us</em> nodes
in the namespace, you also can't have two
<em class="emphasis">/usr/bin</em> directories (<a href="ch02_01.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-2">Figure 2-2</a>). You can, however, have both a
<em class="emphasis">hobbes.pa.ca.us</em> and a
<em class="emphasis">hobbes.lg.ca.us</em> node, as you can have both a
<em class="emphasis">/bin</em> directory and a
<em class="emphasis">/usr/bin</em> <a name="INDEX-105" /></a> <a name="INDEX-106" /></a>directory.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.1.2. Domains</h3>


<a name="INDEX-107" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-108" /></a>A <em class="emphasis">domain</em>
<a name="INDEX-109" /></a>is simply a
subtree of the domain name space. The domain name of a domain is the
same as the domain name of the node at the very top of the domain. So
for example, the top of the <em class="emphasis">purdue.edu</em> domain is
a node named <em class="emphasis">purdue.edu</em>, as shown in <a href="ch02_01.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-3" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="232" alt="Figure 2-3" src="figs/dns4_0203.gif" width="403" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-3. The purdue.edu domain</h4>

Likewise, in a <a name="INDEX-110" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-111" /></a>filesystem, at the top of the
<em class="emphasis">/usr</em> directory, you'd expect to find a
node called <em class="emphasis">/usr</em>, as shown in <a href="ch02_01.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-4">Figure 2-4</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-4" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="207" alt="Figure 2-4" src="figs/dns4_0204.gif" width="302" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-4. The /usr directory</h4>

Any domain name in the subtree is considered a part of the domain.
Because a domain name can be in many subtrees, it can also be in many
domains. For example, the domain name <em class="emphasis">pa.ca.us</em>
is part of the <em class="emphasis">ca.us</em> domain and also part of the
<em class="emphasis">us</em> domain, as shown in <a href="ch02_01.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-5">Figure 2-5</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-5" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="217" alt="Figure 2-5" src="figs/dns4_0205.gif" width="373" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-5. A node in multiple domains</h4>

So in the abstract, a domain is just a subtree of the domain name
space. But if a domain is simply made up of domain names and other
domains, where are all the hosts? Domains are groups of hosts, right?</p><p>


The <a name="INDEX-112" /></a>hosts are there,
represented by domain names. Remember, domain names are just indexes
into the DNS database. The "hosts" are the domain names
that point to information about individual hosts. And a domain
contains all the hosts whose domain names are within the domain. The
hosts are related <em class="emphasis">logically</em>, often by geography
or organizational affiliation, and not necessarily by network or
address or hardware type. You might have 10 different hosts, each on
a different network and perhaps even in a different country, all in
the same domain.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-8" /></a>[8]One note of caution: don't
confuse domains in the Domain Name System with domains in
Sun's<a name="INDEX-113" /></a>
Network Information Service (NIS). Though an NIS domain also refers
to a group of hosts, and both types of domains have similarly
structured names, the concepts are quite different. NIS uses
hierarchical names, but the hierarchy ends there: hosts in the same
NIS domain share certain data about hosts and users, but they
can't navigate the NIS namespace to find data in other NIS
domains. NT domains, which provide account management and security
services, also don't have any relationship to DNS
domains.</p><p>

</blockquote>


Domain names at the leaves of the tree generally represent individual
hosts and may point to network addresses, hardware information, and
mail routing information. Domain names in the interior of the tree
can name a host <em class="emphasis">and</em> can point to information
about the domain. Interior domain names aren't restricted to
one or the other. They can represent both the domain they correspond
to and a particular host on the network. For example,
<em class="emphasis">hp.com</em> is both the name of the Hewlett-Packard
Company's domain and the domain name of the hosts that run
HP's main web server.</p><p>


The type of information retrieved when you use a domain name depends
on the context in which you use it. Sending mail to someone at
<em class="emphasis">hp.com</em> returns mail routing information, while
telneting to the domain name looks up the host information (in <a href="ch02_01.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-6">Figure 2-6</a>, for example,
<em class="emphasis">hp.com</em>'s IP address).<a name="INDEX-114" /></a></p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-6" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="166" alt="Figure 2-6" src="figs/dns4_0206.gif" width="206" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-6. An interior node with both host and structural data</h4>

A domain may have several subtrees of its own, called
<em class="emphasis">subdomains</em><a name="INDEX-115" /></a>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-9" /></a>[9]The terms <em class="emphasis">domain</em> and
<em class="emphasis">subdomain</em> are often used interchangeably, or
nearly so, in DNS and BIND documentation. Here, we use subdomain only
as a relative term: a domain is a subdomain of another domain if the
root of the subdomain is within the domain.</p><p>

</blockquote>


A simple way of deciding whether a
<a name="INDEX-116" /></a>domain is a
<a name="INDEX-117" /></a>subdomain of
another domain is to compare their domain names. A subdomain's
domain name ends with the domain name of its parent domain. For
example, the domain <em class="emphasis">la.tyrell.com</em> must be a
subdomain of <em class="emphasis">tyrell.com</em> because
<em class="emphasis">la.tyrell.com</em> ends with
<em class="emphasis">tyrell.com</em>. Similarly, it's a subdomain of
<em class="emphasis">com</em>, as is <em class="emphasis">tyrell.com</em>.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-118" /></a>Besides being referred to in relative
terms, as subdomains of other domains, domains are often referred to
by <a name="INDEX-119" /></a><em class="emphasis">level</em>. On mailing
lists and in Usenet newsgroups, you may see the terms
<em class="emphasis">top-level domain</em><a name="INDEX-120" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-121" /></a> or <em class="emphasis">second-level
domain</em><a name="INDEX-122" /></a> bandied about.
These terms simply refer to a domain's position in the domain
name space:</p><p>


<ul><li>A top-level domain is a child of the root.<p></p></li><li>A first-level domain is a child of the root (i.e., a top-level
domain).<p></p></li><li>A second-level domain is a child of a first-level domain, and so
on.<a name="INDEX-123" /></a><p></p></li></ul>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.1.3. Resource Records</h3>


The data associated with domain names is contained in
<a name="INDEX-124" /></a><em class="emphasis">resource records</em>, or
RRs. Records are divided into
<a name="INDEX-125" /></a>classes, each of
which pertains to a type of network or software. Currently, there are
classes for internets (any TCP/IP-based internet), networks based on
the Chaosnet protocols, and networks that use Hesiod software.
(Chaosnet is an old network of largely historic significance.)</p><p>


The <a name="INDEX-126" /></a>internet
class is by far the most popular. (We're not really sure if
anyone still uses the <a name="INDEX-127" /></a>Chaosnet class, and use of the
<a name="INDEX-128" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-129" /></a>Hesiod class is
confined mostly to MIT.) In this book, we concentrate on the internet
class.</p><p>


Within a class, records also come in several types, which correspond
to the different varieties of data that may be stored in the domain
name space. Different classes define different record types, though
some types are common to more than one class. For example, almost
every class defines an
<em class="emphasis">address</em><a name="INDEX-130" /></a> type. Each record type in a given class
defines a particular record syntax, which all resource records of
that class and type must adhere to. (For details on internet resource
record types and their syntaxes, see <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "DNS Message Format and Resource Records"</a>.)</p><p>


If this information seems sketchy, don't
worry -- we'll cover the records in the internet class in
more detail later. The common records are described in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, and a more comprehensive list is included as
part of <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "DNS Message Format and Resource Records"</a>.<a name="INDEX-131" /></a></p><p>
