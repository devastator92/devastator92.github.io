of DNS messages is quite straightforward -- you don't have
to deal with ASN.1<a href="#FOOTNOTE-103">[103]</a> at all, as you do with SNMP. And
you have nifty library routines to make parsing DNS messages easy.

However, you might find it handy to have a copy of RFC 1035 to look
at as we go through this chapter; at least have a copy of it nearby
when you write your own DNS programs.<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="INDEX-2276" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2277" /></a>Before you go off and write a C
program to do your DNS chore, you should write the program as a shell
script using <em class="filename">nslookup </em>or
<em class="filename">dig</em>. There are good reasons to start with a
shell script:</p><p>


<ul><li>You can write the shell script much faster than you can write the C
program.<p></p></li><li>If you're not comfortable with DNS, you can work out the
details of your program's logic with a quick shell script
prototype. When you finally write the C program, you can focus on the
additional control you have with C rather than spending your time
reworking the basic functionality.<p></p></li><li>You might find out that the shell script version does your task well
enough so that you don't have to write the C program after all.
And not only is it quicker to write shell scripts, but they're
easier to maintain if you stick with them for the long run.<p></p></li></ul>
If you prefer Perl over plain old shell programming, you can use Perl
instead. At the end of this chapter, we'll show you how to use
the Perl Net::DNS module written by Michael Fuhr.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-15-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.1.1. A Typical Problem</h3>


Before you write a program, you need a problem to solve. Let's
suppose you want your network management system to watch over your
primary master and slave name servers. You want it to notify you of
several problems: a name server that isn't running (it might
have died), a name server that is not authoritative for a zone it is
supposed to be authoritative for (the config file or zone data file
might have been messed up), or a name server that has fallen behind
in updating its zone data (the primary master's serial number
might have been decreased accidentally).</p><p>


Each of these problems is easily detectable. If a name server is not
running on a host, the host sends back an ICMP
<a name="INDEX-2278" /></a><em class="emphasis">port unreachable</em>
message. You can find this out with either a query tool or the
resolver routines. Checking whether a name server is authoritative
for a zone is easy: ask it for the
zone's<a name="INDEX-2279" /></a> SOA
record. If the answer is nonauthoritative or the name server does not
have the SOA record, there's a problem. You'll have to
ask for the SOA record in a<a name="INDEX-2280" /></a><a name="INDEX-2281" /></a><a name="INDEX-2282" /></a>
<em class="emphasis">nonrecursive</em> query so that the name server
doesn't go off and look up the SOA record from another server.
Once you have the SOA record, you can extract the serial number.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-15-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.1.2. Solving This Problem with a Script</h3>


This problem requires a program that takes the domain name of a zone
as an argument, looks up the name servers for that zone, and then
queries each of those name servers for the SOA record for the zone.
The response will show whether the name server is authoritative, and
it will show the zone's serial number. If there is no response,
the program needs to determine if there's even a name server
running on the host. Once you write this program, you should run it
on each zone you want to watch over. Since this program looks up the
name servers (by looking up the NS records for the zone), we assume
that you have listed all your name servers in NS records in your zone
data. If that's not the case, you will have to change this
program to read a list of name servers from the command line.</p><p>


Let's write the basic program as a shell script that uses
<em class="filename">nslookup</em>. First, we figure out what the output
of <em class="filename">nslookup</em> looks like so that we can parse it
with Unix tools. We'll look up NS records to find out which
name servers are supposed to be authoritative for the zone, both when
the server is authoritative for the zone that contains the NS records
and when it isn't:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  relay.hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.2

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>set type=ns</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


Find out what the response looks like when the name server is not
authoritative for the NS records:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mit.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  relay.hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.2

Non-authoritative answer:
mit.edu nameserver = STRAWB.MIT.EDU
mit.edu nameserver = W20NS.MIT.EDU
mit.edu nameserver = BITSY.MIT.EDU

Authoritative answers can be found from:
MIT.EDU nameserver = STRAWB.MIT.EDU
MIT.EDU nameserver = W20NS.MIT.EDU
MIT.EDU nameserver = BITSY.MIT.EDU
STRAWB.MIT.EDU  internet address = 18.71.0.151
W20NS.MIT.EDU   internet address = 18.70.0.160
BITSY.MIT.EDU   internet address = 18.72.0.3</pre></blockquote>


Then find out what the response looks like when the name server
<em class="emphasis">is</em> authoritative for the NS records:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>server strawb.mit.edu.</b></tt>
Default Server:  strawb.mit.edu
Address:  18.71.0.151

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mit.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  strawb.mit.edu
Address:  18.71.0.151

mit.edu nameserver = BITSY.MIT.EDU
mit.edu nameserver = STRAWB.MIT.EDU
mit.edu nameserver = W20NS.MIT.EDU
BITSY.MIT.EDU   internet address = 18.72.0.3
STRAWB.MIT.EDU  internet address = 18.71.0.151
W20NS.MIT.EDU   internet address = 18.70.0.160</pre></blockquote>


You can see from this output that we can grab the domain names of the
name servers by looking for the lines that contain
<em class="emphasis">nameserver</em> and saving the last field. When the
name server wasn't authoritative for the NS records, it printed
them twice, so we'll have to weed out duplicates.</p><p>


Next, we look up the SOA record for the zone, both when the server is
authoritative for the zone that contains the SOA record and when it
isn't. We turn off<a name="INDEX-2283" /></a> <em class="emphasis">recurse</em> so the
name server doesn't go off and query an authoritative name
server for the SOA:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  relay.hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.2

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>set type=soa</b></tt>
&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>set norecurse</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


Find out what the response looks like when the name server is not
authoritative and does not have the SOA record:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mit.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  relay.hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.2

Authoritative answers can be found from:
MIT.EDU nameserver = STRAWB.MIT.EDU
MIT.EDU nameserver = W20NS.MIT.EDU
MIT.EDU nameserver = BITSY.MIT.EDU
STRAWB.MIT.EDU  internet address = 18.71.0.151
W20NS.MIT.EDU   internet address = 18.70.0.160
BITSY.MIT.EDU   internet address = 18.72.0.3</pre></blockquote>


Then find out what the response looks like when the name server
<em class="emphasis">is</em> authoritative for the zone:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>server strawb.mit.edu.</b></tt>
Default Server:  strawb.mit.edu
Address:  18.71.0.151

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mit.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  strawb.mit.edu
Address:  18.71.0.151

mit.edu
        origin = BITSY.MIT.EDU
        mail addr = NETWORK-REQUEST.BITSY.MIT.EDU
        serial = 1995
        refresh = 3600 (1H)
        retry   = 900 (15M)
        expire  = 3600000 (5w6d16h)
        minimum ttl = 21600 (6H)</pre></blockquote>


When the name server was not authoritative for the zone, it returned
references to other name servers. If the name server had previously
looked up the SOA record and cached it, the name server would have
returned the SOA record and said that it was nonauthoritative. We
need to check for both cases. When the name server returns the SOA
record and it is authoritative, we can grab the serial number from
the line that contains <em class="emphasis">serial</em>.</p><p>


Now we need to see what <em class="filename">nslookup</em> returns when no
name server is running on a host. We'll change servers to a
host that does not normally run a name server and look up an SOA
record:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  relay.hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.2

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>server galt.cs.purdue.edu.</b></tt>
Default Server:  galt.cs.purdue.edu
Address:  128.10.2.39

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>set type=soa</b></tt>
&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mit.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  galt.cs.purdue.edu
Address:  128.10.2.39

*** galt.cs.purdue.edu can't find mit.edu.: No response from server</pre></blockquote>


Last, we need to see what <em class="filename">nslookup</em> returns if a
host is not responding. We can test this by switching name servers to
an unused IP address on our LAN:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  relay.hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.2

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>server 15.255.152.100</b></tt>
Default Server:  [15.255.152.100]
Address:  15.255.152.100

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>set type=soa</b></tt>
&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>mit.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  [15.255.152.100]
Address:  15.255.152.100

*** Request to [15.255.152.100] timed-out</pre></blockquote>


In the last two cases, the error message was written to
<em class="emphasis">stderr</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-104">[104]</a> We can make use of that fact when writing our
shell script. Now we are ready to compose the shell script.
We'll call it <em class="filename">check_soa</em>:<p></p><blockquote class="footnote"><a name="FOOTNOTE-104" /></a>[104]Not all versions of <em class="emphasis">nslookup</em> print the last error message for a timeout. Be sure to check what yours prints.<p></p></blockquote>


<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/bin/sh

Here is what the output looks like:</p><p>

If you are pressed for time, this short tool will solve your problem,
and you can go on to other work. If you find that you are checking
lots of zones and that this tool is too slow, you'll want to
convert it to a C program. Also, if you want more control over the
error messages -- rather than relying on
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> for error messages -- then
you'll have to write a C program. We'll do just that
later in this chapter.<a name="INDEX-2284" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2285" /></a></p><p>
