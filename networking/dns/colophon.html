<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>








<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p><p>

<p>The insects featured on the cover of <em class="citetitle">DNS and
BIND</em> are grasshoppers. Grasshoppers are found all over the
globe. Of over 5000 species, 100 different grasshopper species are
found in North America. Grasshoppers are greenish-brown, and range in
length from a half inch to four inches, with wingspans of up to six
inches. Their bodies are divided into three sections: the head,
thorax, and abdomen, with three pairs of legs and two pairs of
wings.</p><p>

<p>Male grasshoppers use their hind legs and forewings to produce a
"chirping" sound. Their hind legs have a ridge of small pegs that are
rubbed across a hardened vein in the forewing, causing an audible
vibration much like a bow being drawn across a string.</p><p>

<p>Grasshoppers are major crop pests, particularly when they
collect in swarms. A single grasshopper can consume 30mg of food a
day. In collections of 50 or more grasshoppers per square yard--a
density often reached during grasshopper outbreaks--grasshoppers
consume as much as a cow would per acre. In addition to consuming
foliage, grasshoppers damage plants by attacking them at vulnerable
points and causing the stems to break off.</p><p>

<p>Emily Quill was the production editor and proofreader for <em class="citetitle">DNS and
BIND, Fourth Edition</em>. Leanne Soylemez was the copyeditor, and also
provided production assistance. Catherine Morris and Matt Hutchinson
performed quality control reviews. Brenda Miller wrote the
index. Production assistance was provided by Edith Shapiro and Sada
Preisch.</p><p>
 
<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby
and Erica Corwell produced the cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1
using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p><p>
 
<p>David Futato and Melanie Wang designed the interior layout, based on a series design by Nancy Priest. Anne-Marie Vaduva converted the files from Microsoft Word to FrameMaker 5.5.6 using tools created by Mike Sierra. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book; the code font is Constant Willison. The illustrations that appear in this book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia Freehand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary.</p><p>
