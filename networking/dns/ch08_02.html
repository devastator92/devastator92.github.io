<h2 class="sect1">8.2. Adding More Name Servers</h2>


When you need to create new name servers for your zones, the simplest
recourse is to add slaves. You already know how -- we went over it
in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a> -- and once you've set up
one slave, cloning it is a piece of cake. But you can run into
trouble by adding slaves indiscriminately.</p><p>


If you run a large number of slave servers for a zone, the
<a name="INDEX-1326" />primary master name server can take quite a
beating just keeping up with the slaves' polling to check that
their zone data is current. There are a number of courses of action
to take for this problem:</p><p>


<ul><li>Make more primary master name servers</p></li><li>Increase the refresh interval so that the slaves don't check so
often</p></li><li>Direct some of the slave name servers to load from other slave name
servers</p></li><li>Create caching-only name servers (described later)</p></li><li>Create "partial-slave" name servers (also described later)</p></li></ul>
<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.2.1. Primary Master and Slave Servers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1327" /> <a name="INDEX-1328" />Creating <a name="INDEX-1329" /> <a name="INDEX-1330" />more
<a name="INDEX-1331" />primaries means extra work for you, since
you have to keep <em class="filename">/etc/named.conf</em> and the zone
data files synchronized manually. Whether or not this is preferable
to your other alternatives is your call. You can use tools like
<a name="INDEX-1332" />
<a name="INDEX-1333" /><em class="filename">rdist</em>
or <em class="filename">rsync<a href="#FOOTNOTE-59">[59]</a> </em><a name="INDEX-1334" />
<a name="INDEX-1335" />to
simplify the process of distributing the files. A<em class="filename">
</em><a name="INDEX-1336" /><em class="filename">distfile <a href="#FOOTNOTE-60">[60]</a> </em>to synchronize files between
primaries might be as simple as the following:</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-59" />[59]<em class="filename">rsync</em> is a
remote file synchronization program that transmits only the
differences between files. You can find out more about it at
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">http://rsync.samba.org</a>.</p><p>

</blockquote><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-60" />[60]The
file <em class="emphasis">rdist</em> reads to find out which files to
update.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote><pre class="code">dup-primary:

# copy named.conf file to dup'd primary

/etc/named.conf  -&gt; wormhole
    install ;

# copy contents of /var/named (zone data files, etc.) to dup'd primary

/var/named -&gt; wormhole
    install ;</pre></blockquote>


or for multiple primaries:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">dup-primary:

primaries =  ( wormhole carrie )
/etc/named.conf  -&gt; {$primaries}
    install ;

/var/named -&gt; {$primaries}
    install ;</pre></blockquote>


You can even have <em class="filename">rdist</em> trigger your name
server's reload using the <a name="INDEX-1337" /><em class="emphasis">special</em> option by
adding lines like:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">special /var/named/* "ndc reload" ;
special /etc/named.conf "ndc reload" ;</pre></blockquote>


These tell <em class="filename">rdist</em> to execute the quoted command
if any of the files change.</p><p>


Increasing your zone's <a name="INDEX-1338" />
<a name="INDEX-1339" />refresh interval is another option.
This slows down the <a name="INDEX-1340" />propagation of new information, however. In
some cases, this is not a problem. If you rebuild your zone data with
<em class="filename">h2n </em>only once each day at 1 a.m. (run from
<em class="filename">cron</em>) and then allow six hours for the data to
distribute, all the slaves will be current by 7 a.m.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-61">[61]</a> That may be
acceptable to your user population. See <a href="ch08_04.html#dns4-CHP-8-SECT-4.1">Section 8.4.1, "Changing Other SOA Values"</a> later in this chapter for
more detail.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-61" />[61]And, of course, if you're using NOTIFY, they'll
catch up much sooner than that.</p><p>

</blockquote>


You can even have some of your <a name="INDEX-1341" />slaves load from other slaves. Slave
name servers <em class="emphasis">can</em> load zone data from other slave
name servers instead of loading from a primary master name server.
The slave name server can't tell if it is loading from a
primary or from another slave. It's important only that the
name server serving the zone transfer is authoritative for the zone.
There's no trick to configuring this. Instead of specifying the
IP address of the primary in the slave's configuration file,
you simply specify the IP address of another slave.</p><p>


Here are the contents of the file <em class="filename">named.conf</em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">// this slave updates from wormhole, another
// slave
zone "movie.edu" {
                type slave;
                masters { 192.249.249.1; };
                file "bak.movie.edu";
};</pre></blockquote>


For a BIND 4 server, this would look slightly different.</p><p>


Here are the contents of the file <em class="filename">named.boot</em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">; this slave updates from wormhole, another slave
secondary   movie.edu   192.249.249.1   bak.movie.edu</pre></blockquote>


When you go to this second level of distribution, though, it can take
up to twice as long for the data to percolate from the primary master
name server to all the slaves. Remember that the <em class="firstterm">refresh
interval </em>is the period after which the slave name servers
will check to make sure that their zone data is still current.
Therefore, it can take the first-level slave servers the entire
refresh interval before they get a new copy of the zone from the
primary master server. Similarly, it can take the second-level slave
servers the entire refresh interval to get a new copy of the zone
from the first-level slave servers. The propagation time from the
primary master server to all of the slave servers can therefore be
twice the refresh interval.</p><p>


One way to avoid this is to use the <a name="INDEX-1342" /> <a name="INDEX-1343" />NOTIFY feature in BIND 8 and 9. This is on
by default, and will trigger zone transfers soon after the zone is
updated on the primary master. Unfortunately, it works only on
Version 8 and 9 BIND slaves.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-62">[62]</a> We'll discuss
NOTIFY in more detail in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-62" />[62]And, incidentally, on
the Microsoft DNS Server.</p><p>

</blockquote>


If you decide to configure your network with two (or more) tiers of
<a name="INDEX-1344" />slave name servers, be careful to avoid
updating loops. If we were to configure <em class="emphasis">wormhole</em> to update from <em class="emphasis">diehard</em> and then accidentally configure
<em class="emphasis">diehard</em> to update from
<em class="emphasis">wormhole</em>, neither would ever
get data from the primary master. They would merely check their
out-of-date serial numbers against each other and perpetually decide
that they were both<a name="INDEX-1345" /> <a name="INDEX-1346" /> up to date.<a name="INDEX-1347" /> <a name="INDEX-1348" /></p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.2.2. Caching-Only Servers</h3>


Creating <em class="firstterm">caching-only
</em><a name="INDEX-1349" /> <a name="INDEX-1350" />name
servers is another alternative when you need more servers.
Caching-only name servers are name servers not authoritative for any
zones (except <em class="emphasis">0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</em>). The name
doesn't imply that primary master and slave name servers
don't cache -- they do. The name implies that the
<em class="emphasis">only</em> function this server performs is looking up
data and caching it. As with primary master and slave name servers, a
caching-only name server needs a root hints file and a
<em class="filename">db.127.0.0 </em>file. The <em class="filename">named.conf
</em><a name="INDEX-1351" />file for a caching-only server
contains these lines:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	directory "/var/named";  // or your data directory
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
	 type master;
	file "db.127.0.0";
};

zone "." {
	type hint;
	file "db.cache";
};</pre></blockquote>


On a BIND 4 server, the <em class="filename">named.boot </em>file looks
like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">directory /var/named  ; or your data directory

primary 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa  db.127.0.0  ; for loopback address
cache   .                     db.cache</pre></blockquote>


A caching-only name server can look up domain names inside and
outside your zone, as can primary master and slave name servers. The
difference is that when a caching-only name server initially looks up
a name within your zone, it ends up asking one of the primary master
or slave name servers for your zone for the answer. A primary or
slave would answer the same question out of its authoritative data.
Which primary or slave does the caching-only server ask? As with name
servers outside your zone, it finds out which name servers serve your
zone from one of the name servers for your parent zone. Is there any
way to prime a caching-only name server's cache so it knows
which hosts run primary master and slave name servers for your zone?
No, there isn't. You can't use <em class="filename">db.cache
 -- </em>the <em class="filename">db.cache</em> file is only for
root name server hints. And actually, it's better that your
caching-only name servers find out about your authoritative name
servers from your parent zone's name servers: you keep your
zone's delegation information up to date. If you hard-wired a
list of authoritative name servers on your caching-only name servers,
you might forget to update it.</p><p>


A <a name="INDEX-1352" />caching-only name server's real value
comes after it builds up its cache. Each time it queries an
authoritative name server and receives an answer, it caches the
records in the answer. Over time, the cache will grow to include the
information most often requested by the resolvers querying the
caching-only name server. And you avoid the overhead of zone
transfers -- a caching-only name server doesn't need to do
them.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.2.3. Partial-Slave Servers</h3>


In between a caching-only name server and a slave name server is
another variation: a name server that is a slave for only a few of
the local zones. We call this a <a name="INDEX-1353" /> <a name="INDEX-1354" /><em class="firstterm">partial-slave
</em>name server<em class="firstterm">
</em>(<a name="INDEX-1355" />and
probably nobody else does). Suppose <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> had 20 of the /24-sized (the
old class C) networks and a corresponding 20 <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones. Instead of creating
a slave server for all 21 zones (all the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> subdomains plus <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>), we could create a
partial-slave server for <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> and only those <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones the host itself is
in. If the host had two network interfaces, its name server would be
a slave for three zones: <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> and the two <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones.</p><p>


Let's say we scare up the hardware for another name server.
We'll call the new host <em class="emphasis">zardoz.movie.edu</em>, with IP addresses
192.249.249.9 and 192.253.253.9. We'll create a partial-slave
name server on <em class="emphasis">zardoz</em>, with
this <em class="filename">named.conf</em><a name="INDEX-1356" /> file:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
	directory "/var/named";
};

zone "movie.edu" {
	type slave;
	masters { 192.249.249.3; };
	file "bak.movie.edu";
};

zone "249.249.192.in-addr.arpa" {
	type slave;
	masters { 192.249.249.3; };
	file "bak.192.249.249";
};

zone "253.253.192.in-addr.arpa" {
	type slave;
	masters { 192.249.249.3; };
	file "bak.192.253.253";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "db.127.0.0";
};

zone "." {
	type hint;
	file "db.cache";
};</pre></blockquote>


For a BIND 4 server, the <em class="filename">named.boot</em> file would
look like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">directory   /var/named
secondary   movie.edu                192.249.249.3 bak.movie.edu
secondary   249.249.192.in-addr.arpa 192.249.249.3 bak.192.249.249
secondary   253.253.192.in-addr.arpa 192.249.249.3 bak.192.253.253
primary     0.0.127.in-addr.arpa     db.127.0.0
cache       .                        db.cache</pre></blockquote>


This server is a slave for <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> and only two of the 20
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones. A
"full" slave would have 21 different
<em class="emphasis">zone</em> statements in
<em class="filename">named.conf</em>.</p><p>


What's so useful about a <a name="INDEX-1357" />partial-slave name server? They're
not much work to administer because their <em class="filename">named.conf
</em>files don't change much. On a name server
authoritative for all the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>zones, we'd need to add and delete <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones (and their
corresponding entries in <em class="filename">named.conf </em>) as our
network changed. That can be a surprising amount of work on a large
network.</p><p>


A partial slave can still answer most of the queries it receives,
though. Most of these queries will be for data in <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> and the two <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones. Why? Because most of
the hosts querying the name server are on the two networks it's
connected to, 192.249.249 and 192.253.253. And those hosts probably
communicate primarily with other hosts on their own network. This
generates queries for data within the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zone that corresponds to
the local network.<a name="INDEX-1358" /> <a name="INDEX-1359" /></p><p>
