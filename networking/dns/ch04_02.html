<h2 class="sect1">4.2. Setting Up Zone Data</h2>


<a name="INDEX-391" />
<a name="INDEX-392" /><a name="INDEX-393" />Our
first step in setting up the Movie U. name servers is to translate
the host table into equivalent DNS zone data. The DNS version of the
data has multiple files. One file maps all the host names to
addresses. Other files map the addresses back to host names. The
<a name="INDEX-394" />name-to-address lookup is sometimes
called <em class="emphasis">forward
mapping</em><a name="INDEX-395" /> <a name="INDEX-396" />, and
the <a name="INDEX-397" />address-to-name
lookup <em class="emphasis">reverse
mapping</em><a name="INDEX-398" />. Each network has its own file for
reverse-mapping data.</p><p>


As a convention in this book, a file that maps host names to
addresses is called
<em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em><a name="INDEX-399" />. For <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>, this file is called
<em class="emphasis">db.movie.edu</em>. The files mapping addresses to
host names are called
<em class="filename">db.ADDR</em><a name="INDEX-400" />, where ADDR is the network number without
trailing zeros or the specification of a netmask. In our example, the
files are called <em class="filename">db.192.249.249</em> and
<em class="filename">db.192.253.253</em>; there's one for each
network. The <em class="filename">db </em>is short for database.
We'll refer to the collection of <em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em>
and <em class="filename">db.ADDR </em>files as <em class="emphasis">zone data
files</em><a name="INDEX-401" />. There are a few other zone data files:
<em class="filename">db.cache </em>and <em class="filename">db.127.0.0</em>.
These files are overhead. Each name server must have them, and they
are more or less the same for each server.</p><p>


To tie all the zone data files together, a name server needs a
<a name="INDEX-402" />configuration file -- for BIND Version
4, this file is usually called <a name="INDEX-403" /><em class="filename">/etc/named.boot</em>. For
BIND Versions 8 and 9, it is usually called
<em class="filename">/etc/named.conf</em><a name="INDEX-404" />. The format of the zone data files is
common to all DNS implementations: it's called the
<em class="emphasis">master file format</em>. The format of the
configuration files, on the other hand, is specific to the name
server implementation -- in this case, BIND.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.1. The Zone Data Files</h3>


Most entries in zone data files are called <em class="emphasis">DNS
</em><a name="INDEX-405" />
<a name="INDEX-406" /><em class="emphasis">resource records</em>.
DNS lookups are <a name="INDEX-407" />case-insensitive, so you can enter names
in your zone data files in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. We
tend to use all lowercase. However, even though lookups are
case-insensitive, case is preserved. That way, if you add records for
<em class="emphasis">Tootsie.movie.edu</em> to your
zone data, people looking up <em class="emphasis">tootsie.movie.edu</em> will find the records,
but with a capital "T" in the domain name.</p><p>


Resource records must start in the first column of a line. The
resource records in the example files in this book do start in the
first column, but they may look indented because of the way the book
is formatted. In the DNS RFCs, the examples present the resource
records in a certain order. Most people have chosen to follow that
order, as we have here, but the order is not a requirement. The order
of resource records in the zone data files is as follows:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>SOA record</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-408" />Indicates
<em class="emphasis">authority</em> for this zone</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>NS record</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-409" />Lists a <em class="emphasis">name
server</em> for this zone</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Other records</i></dt>
<dd>Data about hosts in this zone</p></dd>

</dl>


Of the other records, this chapter covers:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>A</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-410" />Name-to-address mapping</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>PTR</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-411" />Address-to-name mapping</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>CNAME</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-412" />Canonical name (for aliases)</p></dd>

</dl>


Those of you who have some experience with the master file format
will no doubt look at our data and say to yourselves, "It would
have been shorter to specify it this other way...." We're
not using abbreviations or shortcuts in our zone data, at least not
initially, so that you'll understand the full syntax of each
resource record. Once you understand the long version, we'll go
back and "tighten up" the files.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.2. Comments</h3>


The zone data files are easier to read if they contain
<a name="INDEX-413" />comments and
<a name="INDEX-414" />blank lines. Comments start with a
<a name="INDEX-415" />
<a name="INDEX-416" />semicolon and finish at the end of the
line. As you might guess, the name server ignores comments and blank
lines.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.3. Setting the Zone's Default TTL</h3>


Before we start writing our zone data file, we have to find out what
version of BIND we're running. The version makes a difference
because the way you set the default time to live for a zone changed
in <a name="INDEX-417" /> <a name="INDEX-418" />BIND 8.2. Prior to BIND 8.2, the last field
in the SOA record set the default TTL for a zone. But just before
BIND 8.2 came out, RFC 2308 was published, which changed the meaning
of the final field in the SOA record to the <em class="emphasis">negative
caching TTL</em>. This is how long a remote name server can
cache <em class="emphasis">negative responses</em> about the zone, answers
that say that a particular domain name or the type of data sought for
a particular domain name doesn't exist.</p><p>


So how do you set a default TTL for a zone in BIND 8.2 and later?
With the new $TTL <em class="emphasis">control</em> statement. $TTL
specifies the time to live for all records in the file that follow
the statement (but precede any other $TTL<tt class="function">
</tt>statements) and don't have an explicit TTL.</p><p>


The name server supplies this TTL in query responses, allowing other
servers to cache the data for the TTL interval. If your data
doesn't change much, you might consider using a default TTL of
several days. One week is about the longest value that makes sense.
You can use a value as short as one hour, but we typically
don't recommend TTLs lower than that because of the amount of
DNS traffic they cause.</p><p>


Since we're running a new version of BIND, we need to set a
default TTL for our zones with a $TTL statement. Three hours seems
about right to us, so we start our zone data files with:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">$TTL 3h</pre></blockquote>


If you're running a name server older than BIND 8.2,
don't try adding a $TTL statement -- the name server
won't understand it and will treat it as a syntax error.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.4. SOA Records</h3>


The next entry (the first for pre-8.2 BIND servers) in each of these
files is the SOA (start of authority) resource record. The
<a name="INDEX-419" />SOA record
indicates that this name server is the best source of information for
the data within this zone. Our name server is
<em class="emphasis">authoritative</em> for the zone <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> because of the SOA record. An
SOA record is required in each
<em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em><a name="INDEX-420" /> and
<em class="filename">db.ADDR</em><a name="INDEX-421" /> file. There can be one, and only one, SOA
record in a zone data file.</p><p>


We added the following SOA record to the
<em class="filename">db.movie.edu</em> file:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">movie.edu. IN SOA terminator.movie.edu. al.robocop.movie.edu. (
                          1        ; Serial
                          3h       ; Refresh after 3 hours
                          1h       ; Retry after 1 hour
                          1w       ; Expire after 1 week
                          1h )     ; Negative caching TTL of 1 day</pre></blockquote>


The name <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>. must
start in the first column of the file. Make sure the name ends with a
<a name="INDEX-422" />
<a name="INDEX-423" />
<a name="INDEX-424" />trailing
dot, as ours does here, or you'll be surprised at the result!
(We'll explain later in this chapter.)</p><p>


The IN stands for Internet. This is one <em class="emphasis">class</em> of
data -- other classes exist, but none of them is currently in
widespread use. Our examples use only the <a name="INDEX-425" />IN class. The class field is optional. If
the class is omitted, the name server determines the class from the
statement in the configuration file that instructs it to read this
file. We'll see this later in the chapter, too.</p><p>


The first name after SOA (<em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em>.) is the name of
the primary master name server for the <em class="emphasis">movie.edu
</em>zone. The second name (<em class="emphasis">al.robocop.movie.edu</em>.) is the mail
address of the person in charge of the zone if you replace the first
"." with an "@". Often you'll see
<em class="emphasis">root</em><a name="INDEX-426" />,
<em class="emphasis">postmaster</em><a name="INDEX-427" />, or
<em class="emphasis">hostmaster</em><a name="INDEX-428" /> as the <a name="INDEX-429" />email address. Name servers
won't use this address -- it's meant for human
consumption. If you have a problem with a
<a name="INDEX-430" />
<a name="INDEX-431" />zone, you can send a message to
the listed email address. BIND 4.9 and later versions provide another
resource record type, RP (responsible person), for this purpose also.
The <a name="INDEX-432" />RP record is
discussed in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Maintaining BIND"</a>.</p><p>


The <a name="INDEX-433" />
<a name="INDEX-434" />parentheses allow the
SOA record to span more than one line. Most of the fields within the
parentheses of the SOA record are for use by slave name servers and
are discussed when we introduce slave name servers later in this
chapter. For now, assume these are reasonable values.</p><p>


We add similar SOA records to the beginning of the
<em class="filename">db.192.249.249</em> and
<em class="filename">db.192.253.253</em> files. In these files, we change
the first name in the SOA record from <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>. to the name of the
appropriate <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>
zone: <em class="emphasis">249.249.192.in-addr.arpa</em>. and
<em class="emphasis">253.253.192.in-addr.arpa</em>.,
respectively.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.5. NS Records</h3>


The next entries we add to each file are <a name="INDEX-435" /> <a name="INDEX-436" />NS (name server)
resource records. We add one NS record for each name server
authoritative for our zone. Here are the NS records from the
<em class="filename">db.movie.edu</em> file:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">movie.edu.  IN NS  terminator.movie.edu.
movie.edu.  IN NS  wormhole.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


These records indicate that there are two name servers for the zone
<em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>. The name servers
are on the hosts <em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em> and <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>.
<a name="INDEX-437" />Multihomed
hosts, like <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, are excellent
choices for name servers because they are
"well-connected." They are directly accessible by hosts
on more than one network and, if they also serve as routers, are not
often down because they are closely monitored. We'll cover more
on where to place your name servers in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Growing Your Domain"</a>.</p><p>


As with the SOA record, we add NS records to the
<em class="filename">db.192.249.249</em> and
<em class="filename">db.192.253.253</em> files, too.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.6. Address and Alias Records</h3>


<a name="INDEX-438" />
<a name="INDEX-439" />Next, <a name="INDEX-440" />
<a name="INDEX-441" />
<a name="INDEX-442" />we create the <a name="INDEX-443" />name-to-address
mappings. We add the following resource records to the
<em class="filename">db.movie.edu</em> file:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">;
; Host addresses
;
localhost.movie.edu.  IN A     127.0.0.1
robocop.movie.edu.    IN A     192.249.249.2

;
; Multi-homed hosts

;
; Aliases
;
bigt.movie.edu.       IN CNAME terminator.movie.edu.
dh.movie.edu.         IN CNAME diehard.movie.edu.
wh.movie.edu.         IN CNAME wormhole.movie.edu.
wh249.movie.edu.      IN A     192.249.249.1
wh253.movie.edu.      IN A     192.253.253.1</pre></blockquote>


The first two blocks are probably not a surprise. The
<a name="INDEX-444" />A stands for address, and each resource
record maps a name to an address. <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> acts as a router. It
has two addresses associated with its name and therefore two address
records. Unlike host table lookups, a DNS lookup can return more than
one address for a name; a lookup of <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> returns two. If the
requestor and name server are on the same network, some name servers
place the "closest" address first in the response for
better performance. This feature is
called<a name="INDEX-445" />
<em class="emphasis">address sorting</em><a name="INDEX-446" /> and is covered in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>. If address sorting does not apply, the
addresses are
<em class="emphasis">rotated</em><a name="INDEX-447" />
<a name="INDEX-448" /> between
queries so subsequent responses list them in a different order. This
<a name="INDEX-449" />"round robin" feature
first shows up in BIND 4.9.</p><p>


The third block has the <a name="INDEX-450" />host table aliases. For the first three
aliases, we created <a name="INDEX-451" />CNAME (canonical
name) resource records. However, we created address records for the
other two aliases (more on this in a moment). A CNAME record maps an
alias to its canonical name. The name server handles CNAME records
differently from the way aliases are handled in the host table. When
a name server looks up a name and finds a CNAME record, it replaces
the name with the canonical name and looks up the new name. For
example, when the name server looks up <em class="emphasis">wh.movie.edu</em>, it finds a CNAME record
pointing to <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>. It then looks up
<em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> and
returns both addresses.</p><p>


There is one thing to remember about aliases like <em class="emphasis">bigt.movie.edu</em> -- they should never
appear on the right-hand side of a resource record. Stated
differently, you should always use the canonical name (e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em>) in the
data portion of the resource record. Notice that the NS records we
just created use the canonical name.</p><p>


The final two entries solve a special problem. Suppose you have a
router, like <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, and you want to
check one of the interfaces. One common troubleshooting technique is
to <em class="filename">ping</em> the interface to verify that it is
responding. If you <a name="INDEX-452" /><em class="filename">ping</em> the name
<em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, the name
server returns both addresses for the name. <em class="filename">ping</em>
uses the first address in the list. But which address is first?</p><p>


With the host table, we choose the address we want by using either
<em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em> or
<em class="emphasis">wh253.movie.edu</em>; each name
referred to <em class="emphasis">one</em> of the host's addresses.
To provide an equivalent capability with DNS, we don't make
<em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em> and
<em class="emphasis">wh253.movie.edu</em> into aliases
(CNAME records). That would result in both addresses for <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> being returned when
the alias was looked up. Instead, we use address records. Now, to
check the operation of the 192.253.253.1 interface on <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, we <em class="filename">ping
wh253.movie.edu</em> since it refers to only one address. The
same applies to <em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em>.</p><p>


To state this as a general rule: if a host is
<a name="INDEX-453" />multihomed
(has more than one network interface), create an address (A) record
for each alias unique to one address. Create a CNAME record for each
alias common to all the addresses.</p><p>


Now, don't tell your users about names like <em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em> and <em class="emphasis">wh253.movie.edu</em>. Those names are meant
for system-administration purposes only. If users learn to use names
like <em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em>,
they'll be confused when the name doesn't work for them
in some places, like <em class="filename">.rhosts </em>files. That's
because these places need the name that results from looking up the
address: the canonical name, <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>.</p><p>


Since we use A (address) records for the <em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em> and <em class="emphasis">wh253.movie.edu</em> aliases, you might ask,
"Is it okay to use <a name="INDEX-454" /> <a name="INDEX-455" />address records instead of CNAME
records in <em class="emphasis">all</em> cases?" Well, using address
records instead of CNAME records doesn't cause problems with
most applications, since most applications care only about finding IP
addresses. There is one
application -- <a name="INDEX-456" /><em class="filename">sendmail -- </em>whose
behavior changes, though. <em class="filename">sendmail</em> usually
replaces aliases in mail headers with their canonical names; this
<a name="INDEX-457" /><em class="emphasis">canonicalization</em>
happens only if the names in the mail header have CNAME data
associated with them. If you don't use CNAME records for
aliases, your <em class="filename">sendmail</em> will have to understand
all the possible aliases your host might be known by, which will
require extra <em class="filename">sendmail</em> configuration on your
part.</p><p>


In addition to the problem with <em class="filename">sendmail</em>, users
might be confused when they try to figure out the canonical name to
enter in their <em class="filename">.rhosts</em> file. Looking up a name
that has CNAME data leads them to the canonical name, whereas address
data won't. In this case, users <em class="emphasis">should
</em>instead be looking up the IP address to get the canonical
name, as <em class="filename">rlogind</em> does, but users like these
never seem to be on systems we<a name="INDEX-458" /> <a name="INDEX-459" /> <a name="INDEX-460" /> administer.<a name="INDEX-461" /> <a name="INDEX-462" /></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-2.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.7. PTR Records</h3>


Next we create the
<a name="INDEX-463" />
<a name="INDEX-464" />address-to-name mappings. The file
<em class="filename">db.192.249.249</em> maps addresses to host names for
the 192.249.249/24 network. The DNS resource records used for this
mapping are <a name="INDEX-465" />
<a name="INDEX-466" />PTR (pointer) records. There is one record
for each network interface on this network. (Recall that addresses
are looked up as names in DNS. The address is reversed and
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> is appended.)</p><p>


Here are the PTR records we added for network 192.249.249/24:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">1.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR wormhole.movie.edu.
2.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR robocop.movie.edu.
3.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR terminator.movie.edu.
4.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN PTR diehard.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


There are a couple of things you should notice about this data.
First, addresses should point to only a single name: the canonical
name. Thus, 192.249.249.1 maps to <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, not to <em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em>. You
<em class="emphasis">can</em> create two PTR records, one for <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> and one for
<em class="emphasis">wh249.movie.edu</em>, but most
systems are not prepared to see more than one name for an address.
Second, even though <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> has two addresses,
you see only one of them here. That's because this file shows
only the direct connections to network 192.249.249/24, and
<em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> has only
one connection there.</p><p>


We created similar data for the 192.253.253/24 network.</p><p>

Why do name servers need this silly little file? Think about it for a
second. No one was given responsibility for network 127.0.0/24, yet
systems use it for a loopback address. Since no one has direct
responsibility, everyone who uses it is responsible for it
individually. You could omit this file and your name server would
operate. However, a lookup of 127.0.0.1 might fail because the root
name server contacted wasn't itself configured to map 127.0.0.1
to a name. You should provide the mapping yourself so there are no
surprises.</p><p>

The domain name "." refers to the root zone. Since the
root zone's name servers change over time, don't assume
this list is current. Download a new version of
<em class="filename">named.root</em>.</p><p>


How is this file kept up to date? As the network
<a name="INDEX-477" />administrator, that's
your responsibility. Some old versions of BIND did update this file
periodically. That feature was disabled, though; apparently, it
didn't work as well as the authors had hoped. Sometimes the
changed <em class="filename">db.cache </em>file is mailed to the
<a name="INDEX-478" /> <a name="INDEX-479" /><em class="emphasis">bind-users</em>
or <a name="INDEX-480" /><em class="emphasis">namedroppers</em> mailing
list. If you are on one of these lists, you are likely to hear about
changes.</p><p>


Can you put data other than root name server data in this file? You
can, but it won't be used. Originally, the name server
installed this data in its cache. However, the use of the file has
changed (subtly) though the name <a name="INDEX-481" />"cache file" stuck. The name
server stores the data in this file in a special place in memory as
the <em class="emphasis">root hints</em><em class="emphasis">.</em> It does not
discard the hints if their <a name="INDEX-482" />TTLs drop to <a name="INDEX-483" />zero, as it would with cached data.
The name server uses the <a name="INDEX-484" />hint data
to query the root name servers for the current list of root name
servers, which it caches. When the cached list of root name servers
times out, the name server again uses the hints to get a new list.</p><p>


Why does the name server bother querying a name server in the root
hints file -- probably itself a root name server -- for a list
of root name servers when it already has a list? Because that name
server almost certainly knows the <em class="emphasis">current</em> list
of root name servers, while the file may be out of date.</p><p>


What are the 3600000s for? That's an explicit time to live for
the records in the file. In older versions of this file, this number
was 99999999. Since the contents of this file were originally cached,
the name server needed to know how long to keep those records active.
99999999 seconds was just a very long time -- the root name server
data was to be kept in cache for as long as the server ran. Since the
name server now stores this data in a special place and doesn't
discard it if it times out, the TTL is unnecessary. But it's
not harmful to have the 3600000s, and it makes for interesting BIND
folklore when you pass responsibility to the next<a name="INDEX-485" /> name<a name="INDEX-486" /> <a name="INDEX-487" /> server
administrator.<a name="INDEX-488" /> <a name="INDEX-489" /></p><p>
