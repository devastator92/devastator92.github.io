<h2 class="sect1">7.2. Updating Zone Data Files</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1018" />
<a name="INDEX-1019" />Something is always changing on
your network -- new workstations arrive, you finally retire or
sell the relic, or you move a host to a different network. Each
change means that zone data files must be modified. Should you make
the changes manually? Or should you wimp out and use a tool to help
you?</p><p>


First we'll discuss how to make the changes manually. Then
we'll talk about a tool to help out: <em class="filename">h2n</em>.
Actually, we recommend that you use a tool to create the zone data
files -- we were kidding about that wimp stuff, okay? Or at least
use a tool to increment the serial number for you. The syntax of zone
data files lends itself to making mistakes. It doesn't help
that the address and pointer records are in different files, which
must agree with each other. However, even when you use a tool, it is
critical to know what goes on when the files are updated, so
we'll start with the manual method.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.2.1. Adding and Deleting Hosts</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1020" />
<a name="INDEX-1021" />After
creating your zone data files initially, it should be fairly apparent
what you need to change when you add a new host. We'll go
through the steps here in case you weren't the one to set up
those files or if you'd just like a checklist to follow. Make
these changes to your <em class="emphasis">primary</em> master name
server's zone data files. If you make the changes to your
<em class="emphasis">slave</em> name server's backup zone data
files, the slave's data will change, but the next zone transfer
will overwrite it.</p><p>


<ol><li>Update the serial number in <em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em>. The
serial number is likely to be at the top of the file, so it's
easy to do first and reduces the chance that you'll forget.</p></li><li>Add any A (address), CNAME (alias), and MX (mail exchanger) records
for the host to the <em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em> file. We added the
following resource records to the <em class="filename">db.movie.edu
</em>file when a new host (<em class="emphasis">cujo</em>) was
added to our network:</p><p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">cujo  IN  A  192.253.253.5  ; cujo's internet address
IN MX  10 cujo        ; if possible, mail directly to
cujo
IN MX  20 terminator  ; otherwise, deliver to our mail hub</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>Update the serial number and add PTR records to each
<em class="filename">db.ADDR</em> file for which the host has an address.
<em class="emphasis">cujo</em> only has one address,
on network 192.253.253/24; therefore, we added the following PTR
record to the <em class="filename">db.192.253.253</em> file:</p><p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">5  IN PTR cujo.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>Reload the primary master name server; this forces it to load the new
information:</p><p>
<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>ndc reload</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


If you've got a snazzy BIND 8.2 or newer name server, you can
reload just the zones you changed:</p><p>
<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>ndc reload movie.edu 253.253.192.in-addr.arpa</b></tt></pre></blockquote>
</li></ol>

The primary master name server will load the new zone data. Slave
name servers will load this new data sometime within the time
interval defined in the SOA record for refreshing their data.</p><p>


Sometimes your users won't want to wait for the slaves to pick
up the new zone data -- they'll want it available right
away. (Are you wincing or nodding knowingly as you read this?) Can
you force a slave to load the new information right away? With
Version 8 or 9 masters and slaves, the slaves pick up the new data
quickly because the primary master notifies the slaves of changes
within 15 minutes of the change. If your name server is 4.9 or later,
you can reload it just as you did for your primary master name
server. The reload induces the name server to refresh all of its
slave zones. If your name server is 4.8.3 or earlier, remove all the
slave's backup zone data files (or just the ones you want to
force), kill the slave server, and start up a new one. Since the
backup files are gone, the slave must immediately pull new copies of
the zones.</p><p>


To delete a
<a name="INDEX-1022" />host,
remove the resource records from the <em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em>
and from each <em class="filename">db.ADDR </em>file pertaining to that
host. Increment the serial number in each zone data file you changed
and reload your primary master name server.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.2.2. SOA Serial Numbers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1023" />Each
of the zone data files has a serial number. Every time you change the
data in a zone data file, you must increment the serial number. If
you don't increment the serial number, slave name servers for
the zone won't pick up the updated data.</p><p>


Incrementing the serial number is simple. If the original zone data
file had this <a name="INDEX-1024" />SOA record:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">movie.edu. IN SOA terminator.movie.edu. al.robocop.movie.edu. (
                                100     ; Serial
                                3h      ; Refresh
                                1h      ; Retry
                                1w      ; Expire
                                1h )    ; Negative caching TTL</pre></blockquote>


the updated zone data file would have this SOA record:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">movie.edu. IN SOA terminator.movie.edu. al.robocop.movie.edu. (
                                101     ; Serial
                                3h      ; Refresh
                                1h      ; Retry
                                1w      ; Expire
                                1h )    ; Negative caching TTL</pre></blockquote>


This simple change is the key to distributing the zone data to all of
your slaves. Failing to increment the serial number is the most
common mistake made when updating a zone. The first few times you
make a change to a zone data file, you'll remember to update
the serial number because the process is new and you're paying
close attention. After modifying the zone data file becomes second
nature, you'll make some "quickie" little change,
forget to update the serial number . . . and none of the slaves will
pick up the new zone data. That's why you should use a tool
that updates the serial number for you! It could be
<em class="filename">h2n</em> or something you write yourself, but
it's a good idea to use a tool.</p><p>


BIND does allow you to use a decimal serial number like 1.1, but we
recommend that you use only <a name="INDEX-1025" />
<a name="INDEX-1026" />integer values. Here's how BIND
Version 4 handles <a name="INDEX-1027" />
<a name="INDEX-1028" />decimal serial numbers: if there is a
decimal point in the serial number, BIND multiplies the digits to the
left of the decimal by 1000. The digits to the right of the decimal
point are then <em class="emphasis">concatenated</em> to the digits on the
left. Therefore, a number like 1.1 is converted to 10001 internally,
and 1.10 is converted to 100010. This creates certain anomalies; for
example, 1.1 is "greater" than 2, and 1.10 is
"greater" than 2.1. Because this is so counterintuitive,
we think it's best to stick with integer serial numbers.</p><p>


There are several good ways to manage integer serial numbers. The
most obvious is just to use a <a name="INDEX-1029" />counter:
increment the serial number by one each time you modify the file.
Another method is to derive the serial number from the date. For
example, you could use the eight-digit number formed by YYYYMMDD.
Suppose today is January 15, 1997. In this form, your serial number
would be 19970115. This scheme allows only one update per day,
though, and that may not be enough. Add another two digits to this
number to indicate how many times the file has been updated that day.
The first number for January 15, 1997 would then be 1997011500. The
next modification that day would change the serial number to
1997011501. This scheme allows 100 updates per day. It also has the
advantage of leaving you an indication in the zone data file of when
you last incremented the serial number. <em class="filename">h2n</em> will
generate the serial number from the date if you use the
<span class="option">-y</span> option. Whatever scheme you choose, the serial
number must fit in a 32-bit integer.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.2.3. Starting Over with a New Serial Number</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1030" />
<a name="INDEX-1031" />What do you do if the serial
number on one of your zones accidentally becomes very large and you
want to change it back to a more reasonable value? There is a way
that works with all versions of BIND, a way that works with Version
4.8.1 and later, and one that works with 4.9 and later.</p><p>


The way that always works with all versions is to purge your slaves
of any knowledge of the old serial number. Then you can start
numbering from one (or any convenient point). Here's how.
First, change the serial number on your primary master server and
restart it; now the primary master server has the new integer serial
number. Log onto one of your slave name server hosts and kill the
<em class="filename">named</em> process with the command <em class="filename">ndc
stop</em>. Remove its backup zone data files (e.g.,
<em class="filename">rm bak.movie.edu bak.192.249.249
bak.192.253.253</em>) and start up your slave name server.
Since the backup copies were removed, the slave must load a new
version of the zone data files -- picking up the new serial
numbers. Repeat this process for each slave server. If any of your
slave name servers aren't under your control, you'll have
to contact their administrators to get them to do the same.</p><p>


If all your slaves run a version of BIND newer than 4.8.1 (and we
pray you're not using 4.8.1) but older than BIND 9, you can
take advantage of the special serial number zero. If you set a
zone's serial number to <a name="INDEX-1032" />zero, each slave will transfer the zone
the next time it checks. In fact, the zone will be transferred
<em class="emphasis">every</em> time the slave checks, so don't
forget to increment the serial number once all the slaves have
synchronized on serial number zero. But there is a limit to how far
you can increment the serial number. Read on.</p><p>


The other method of fixing the serial number (with 4.9 and later
slaves) is easier to understand if we first cover some background
material. The DNS serial number is a 32-bit unsigned integer whose
value ranges from
to 4,294,967,295. The serial number uses <a name="INDEX-1033" /><em class="firstterm">sequence space
arithmetic</em>, which means that for any serial number, half
the numbers in the number space (2,147,483,647 numbers) are less than
the serial number and half the numbers are larger.</p><p>


Let's go over an example of sequence space numbers. Suppose the
serial number is 5. Serial numbers 6 through (5 + 2,147,483,647) are
larger than serial number 5 and serial numbers (5 + 2,147,483,649)
through 4 are smaller. Notice that the serial number wrapped around
to 4 after reaching 4,294,967,295. Also notice that we didn't
include the number (5 + 2,147,483,648), because this is exactly
halfway around the number space and could be larger or smaller than
5, depending on the implementation. To be safe, don't use it.</p><p>


Now back to the original problem. If your zone serial number is
25,000 and you want to start numbering at 1 again, you can speed
through the serial number space in two steps. First, add the largest
increment possible to your serial number (25,000 + 2,147,483,647 =
2,147,508,647). If the number you come up with is larger than
4,294,967,295 (the largest 32-bit value), you'll have wrap
around to the beginning of the number space by subtracting
4,294,967,296 from it. After changing the serial number, you must
wait for all of your slaves to pick up a new copy of the zone.
Second, change the zone serial number to its target value (1), which
is now <em class="emphasis">larger</em> than the current serial number
(2,147,508,647). After the slaves pick up a new copy of the zone,
you're done!</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.2.4. Additional Zone Data File Entries</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1034" /> <a name="INDEX-1035" />After you've been running a name
server for a while, you may want to add data to your name server to
help you manage your zone. Have you ever been stumped when someone
asked you <em class="emphasis">where</em> one of your hosts is? Maybe you
don't even remember what kind of host it is. Administrators
have to manage larger and larger populations of hosts these days,
making it easy to lose track of this information. The name server can
help you out. And if one of your hosts is acting up and someone
notices remotely, the name server can help them get in touch with
you.</p><p>


So far in the book, we've covered SOA, NS, A, CNAME, PTR, and
MX records. These records are critical to everyday
operation -- name servers need them to operate, and applications
look up data of these types. DNS defines many more datatypes, though.
The next most useful resource record types are TXT and RP; these can
be used to tell you a host's location and responsible person.
For a list of common (and not-so-common) resource records, see <a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "DNS Message Format and Resource Records"</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.2.4.1. General text information</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1036" />TXT stands for
TeXT. These records are simply a list of strings, each less than 256
characters in length. Versions of BIND prior to 4.8.3 do not support
TXT records. In Version 4, BIND limits the zone data file TXT record
to a single string of almost 2K of data.</p><p>


TXT records can be used for anything you want; one use is to list a
<a name="INDEX-1037" />host's location:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">cujo  IN  TXT  "Location: machine room dog house"</pre></blockquote>


BIND 8 and 9 have the same 2K limit, but you can specify the TXT
record as multiple strings:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">cujo  IN  TXT  "Location:" "machine room dog house"</pre></blockquote>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.4.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.2.4.2. Responsible Person</h3>


Domain administrators will undoubtedly develop a love/hate
relationship with the Responsible Person, or RP, record. The
<a name="INDEX-1038" />
<a name="INDEX-1039" />RP record can be attached to any domain
name, internal or leaf, and indicates who is responsible for that
<a name="INDEX-1040" />
<a name="INDEX-1041" />host or zone. This enables you to locate
the miscreant responsible for the host peppering you with DNS
queries, for example. But it also leads people to you when one of
your hosts acts up.</p><p>


The record takes two arguments as its record-specific data: an
<a name="INDEX-1042" />electronic mail address in domain name
format, and a <a name="INDEX-1043" />domain name pointing to additional data
about the contact. The electronic mail address is in the same format
the SOA record uses: it substitutes a "." for the
"@". The next argument is a domain name, which must have
a TXT record associated with it. The TXT record then contains
free-format information about the contact, like full name and phone
number. If you omit either field, you must specify the root domain
(".") as a placeholder instead.</p><p>


Here are some example RP (and associated) records:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">robocop      IN  RP   root.movie.edu.  hotline.movie.edu.
             IN  RP   richard.movie.edu.  rb.movie.edu.
hotline      IN  TXT  "Movie U. Network Hotline, (415) 555-4111"
rb           IN  TXT  "Richard Boisclair, (415) 555-9612"</pre></blockquote>


Note that TXT records for <em class="emphasis">root.movie.edu</em> and <em class="emphasis">richard.movie.edu</em> aren't
necessary, since they're only the domain name encoding of
electronic mail addresses, not real domain names.</p><p>


This resource record didn't exist when BIND 4.8.3 was
implemented, but BIND 4.9 supports it. Check the documentation for
your version of the name server to see if it supports RP before
trying to use it.<a name="INDEX-1044" /> <a name="INDEX-1045" /></p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-7-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.2.5. Generating Zone Data Files from the Host Table</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1046" />As <a name="INDEX-1047" />
<a name="INDEX-1048" />you
saw in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, we defined a process for
converting host table information into zone data. We've written
a tool in <a name="INDEX-1049" />Perl to automate this process,
called <em class="filename">h2n</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-51">[51]</a> Using a tool to generate your data has
one big advantage: there will be no syntax errors or inconsistencies
in your zone data files -- assuming we wrote
<em class="filename">h2n</em> correctly! One common inconsistency is to
have an A (address) record for a host but no corresponding PTR
(pointer) record, or the other way around. Because this data is in
separate zone data files, it is easy to err.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-51" />[51]In case you've
forgotten how to get <em class="filename">h2n</em>, see <a href="ch00_01.html">the Preface</a><em class="citetitle">" </em>in the
Preface.</p><p>

</blockquote>


What does <em class="filename">h2n</em> do? Given the<em class="filename">
/etc/hosts</em> file and some <a name="INDEX-1050" />command-line
options, <em class="filename">h2n</em> creates the data files for your
zones. As a system administrator, you keep the host table current.
Each time you modify the host table, you run <em class="filename">h2n</em>
again. <em class="filename">h2n</em> rebuilds each zone data file from
scratch, assigning each new file the next higher serial number. It
can be run manually or from <em class="filename">cron</em> each night. If
you use <em class="filename">h2n</em>, you'll never again have to
worry about forgetting to increment the serial number.</p><p>


First, <em class="filename">h2n</em> needs to know the domain name of your
forward-mapping zone and your network numbers.
(<em class="filename">h2n</em> can figure out the names of your
reverse-mapping zones from your network numbers.) These map
conveniently into the zone data filenames: <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> zone data goes in
<em class="filename">db.movie</em>, and network 192.249.249/24 data goes
into <em class="filename">db.192.249.249</em>. The domain name of your
forward-mapping zone and your network number are specified with the
<span class="option">-d</span> and <span class="option">-n</span> options, as follows:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>-d domain name</i></dt>
<dd>The domain name of your forward-mapping zone.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-n network number</i></dt>
<dd>The network number of your network. If you are generating files for
several networks, use several <span class="option">-n</span> options on the
command line. Omit trailing zeros and netmask specifications from the
network numbers.</p></dd>

</dl>


The <em class="filename">h2n</em> command requires the <span class="option">-d
</span>flag and at least one <span class="option">-n</span> option; they have
no default values. For example, to create the data file for the zone
<em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>, which consists of
two networks, give the command:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>h2n -d movie.edu -n 192.249.249 -n 192.253.253</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


For greater control over the data, you can use other options:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>-s server</i></dt>
<dd>The name servers for the NS records. As with <span class="option">-n</span>, use
several <span class="option">-s</span> options if you have multiple primary
master or slave name servers. A Version 8 or 9 server will NOTIFY
this list of servers when a zone changes. The default is the host on
which you run <em class="filename">h2n</em>.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-h host</i></dt>
<dd>The host for the MNAME field of the SOA record.
<em class="emphasis">host</em> must be the primary master name server to
ensure proper operation of the NOTIFY feature. The default is the
host on which you run <em class="filename">h2n</em>.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-u user</i></dt>
<dd>The mail address of the person in charge of the zone data. This
defaults to <em class="emphasis">root</em> on the host on which you run
<em class="filename">h2n</em>.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-o other</i></dt>
<dd>Other SOA values, not including the serial number, as a
colon-separated list. These default to 10800:3600:604800:86400.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-f file</i></dt>
<dd>Read the <em class="filename">h2n</em> options from the named
<em class="emphasis">file</em> rather than from the command line. If you
have lots of options, keep them in a file.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-v 4|8</i></dt>
<dd>Generate configuration files for BIND 4 or 8; Version 4 is the
default. Since BIND 9's configuration file format is basically
the same as BIND 8's, you can use -<em class="emphasis">v 8</em> for
a BIND 9 name server.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>-y</i></dt>
<dd>Generate the serial number from the date.</p></dd>

</dl>


Here is an example that uses all the options mentioned so far:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>h2n -f opts</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


Contents of file <em class="filename">opts</em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">-d movie.edu
-n 192.249.249
-n 192.253.253
-s terminator.movie.edu
-s wormhole
-u al
-h terminator
-o 10800:3600:604800:86400
-v 8
-y</pre></blockquote>


If an option requires a host name, you can provide either a full
domain name (e.g., <em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em>) or just the
host's name (e.g., <em class="emphasis">terminator</em>). If you give the host name
only, <em class="filename">h2n</em> forms a complete domain name by adding
the domain name given with the <span class="option">-d</span> option. (If a
trailing dot is necessary, <em class="filename">h2n</em> adds it too.)</p><p>


There are more options to <em class="filename">h2n</em> than we've
shown here. For the complete list of options, you'll have to
look at the manpage.</p><p>


Of course, some kinds of resource records aren't easy to
generate from <em class="filename">/etc/hosts  -- </em>the necessary
data simply isn't there. You may need to add these records
manually. But since <em class="filename">h2n</em> always rewrites zone
data files, won't your changes be overwritten?</p><p>


Well, <em class="filename">h2n</em> provides a "back door" for
inserting this kind of data. Put these special records in a file
named <a name="INDEX-1051" /><em class="filename">spcl.DOMAIN</em>, where
<em class="emphasis">DOMAIN</em> is the first label of the domain name of
your zone. When <em class="filename">h2n</em> finds this file, it will
"include" it by adding the line:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">$INCLUDE spcl.DOMAIN</pre></blockquote>


to the end of the <em class="filename">db.DOMAIN</em> file. (The $INCLUDE
statement is described later in this chapter.) For example, the
administrator of <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>
may add extra MX records into the file
<em class="filename">spcl.movie</em> so that users can mail to <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> directly instead of sending
mail to hosts within <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>. Upon finding this file,
<em class="filename">h2n</em> would put the line:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">$INCLUDE spcl.movie</pre></blockquote>


at the end of the zone data file<a name="INDEX-1052" /> <a name="INDEX-1053" />
<em class="filename">db.movie</em>.<a name="INDEX-1054" /></p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">7.2.6. Keeping the Root Hints Current</h3>


As we explained in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, the
<a name="INDEX-1055" />
<a name="INDEX-1056" /> <a name="INDEX-1057" />
<a name="INDEX-1058" />root hints file tells your name server
where the servers for the root zone are. It must be updated
periodically. The root name servers don't change very often,
but they do change. A good practice is to check your root hints file
every month or two. In <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, we told you to
get the file by FTPing to ftp.rs.internic.net. And that's
probably the best way to keep current.</p><p>


If you have a copy of <a name="INDEX-1059" />
<a name="INDEX-1060" /><em class="filename">dig</em>,
a utility that works a lot like <em class="filename">nslookup</em> and is
included in the BIND distribution, you can retrieve the current list
of root name servers just by running:<a name="INDEX-1061" /> <a name="INDEX-1062" /></p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>dig @a.root-servers.net  .  ns &gt; db.cache</b></tt></pre></blockquote>
