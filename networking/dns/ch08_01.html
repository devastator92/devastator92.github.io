<h2 class="sect1">8.1. How Many Name Servers?</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1279" /></a>We set up two name servers in
<a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>. Two servers are as few as you'll
ever want to run. Depending on the size of your network, you may need
to run many more than just two servers. It is not uncommon to run
from five to seven servers, with one of them off-site. How many name
servers are enough? You'll have to decide that based on your
network. Here are some guidelines to help out:</p><p>


<ul><li>Run at least one name server on each network or subnet you have. This
removes routers as a point of failure. Make the most of any
multihomed hosts you have, since they are (by definition) attached to
more than one network.<p></p></li><li>If you have a file server and some diskless nodes, run a name server
on the file server to serve this group of machines.<p></p></li><li>Run name servers near, but not necessarily on, large multiuser
computers. The users and their processes probably generate a lot of
queries, and as an administrator, you will work harder to keep a
multiuser host up. But balance their needs against the risk of
running a name server -- a security-critical server -- on a
system that lots of people have access to.<p></p></li><li>Run at least one name server <a name="INDEX-1280" /></a>off-site. This makes your data available
when your network isn't. You might argue that it's
useless to look up an address when you can't reach the host.
Then again, the off-site name server may be available if your network
is reachable, but your other name servers are down. If you have a
close relationship with an organization on the Internet -- say
another university or a business partner -- they may be willing to
run a slave for you.<p></p></li></ul>
<a href="ch08_01.html#dns4-CHP-8-FIG-1">Figure 8-1</a> shows a sample topology and a brief
analysis to show you how this might work.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-8-FIG-1" /></a><div class="figure"><img height="310" alt="Figure 8-1" src="figs/dns4_0801.gif" width="427" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-1. Sample network topology</h4>

Notice that if you follow our guidelines, there are still a number of
places you could choose to run a name server. Host <em class="emphasis">d</em>, the file server for hosts <em class="emphasis">a</em>, <em class="emphasis">b</em>, <em class="emphasis">c</em>, and <em class="emphasis">e</em>, could run a name server. Host
<em class="emphasis">g</em>, a big, multiuser host, is
another good candidate. But probably the best choice is host
<em class="emphasis">f</em>, the smaller host with
interfaces on both networks. You'll need to run only one name
server instead of two, and it'll run on a closely watched host.
If you want more than one name server on either network, you can also
run one on <em class="emphasis">d</em> or <em class="emphasis">g</em>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.1.1. Where Do I Put My Name Servers?</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1281" /></a>In addition to giving you a rough idea of
how many name servers you'll need, these criteria should also
help you decide <em class="emphasis">where</em> to run name servers (e.g.,
on file servers and multihomed hosts). But there are other important
considerations when choosing the right
<a name="INDEX-1282" /></a>host.</p><p>


Other factors to keep in mind are the host's connectivity, the
software it runs (BIND and otherwise), maintaining the homogeneity of
your name servers, and security:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>Connectivity</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1283" /></a>It's important that name servers be
well-connected. Having a name server running on the fastest, most
reliable host on your network won't do you any good if the host
is mired in some backwater subnet of your network behind a slow,
flaky serial line. Try to find a host close to your link to the
Internet (if you have one), or find a well-connected Internet host to
act as a slave for your zone. And on your own network, try to run
name servers near the hubs of your network.</p><p>

It's doubly important that your primary master name server be
well connected. The primary needs good connectivity to all the slaves
that update from it, for reliable zone transfers. And, like any name
server, it'll benefit from fast, reliable networking.</p><p>

</dd>

<dt><i>Software</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1284" /></a>Another factor to consider in choosing a
host for a name server is the software the host runs. Software-wise,
the best candidate for a name server is a host running a
vendor-supported version of BIND 8.2.3 or 9.1.0 and a robust
implementation of TCP/IP (preferably based on 4.3 or 4.4 BSD
Unix's networking -- we're Berkeley snobs). You can
compile your own 8.2.3 or 9.1.0 BIND from the
sources -- it's not hard, and the latest versions are very
reliable -- but you'll probably have a tough time getting
your vendor to support it. If you don't absolutely need a
feature of BIND 8, you may be able to get away with running your
vendor's port of older BIND code, like 4.9.7, which will give
you the benefit of your vendor's support, for what that's
worth.<p></p></dd>


<dt><i>Homogeneity</i></dt>
<dd>One last thing to take into account is
the<a name="INDEX-1285" /></a> homogeneity of your name servers. As much
as you might believe in "open systems," hopping between
different versions of Unix can be frustrating and confusing. Avoid
running name servers on lots of different platforms, if you can. You
can waste a lot of time porting your scripts (or ours!) from one
operating system to another or looking for the location of
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> or <em class="filename">named.conf</em> on
three different Unixes. Moreover, different vendors' versions
of Unix tend to support different versions of BIND, which can cause
all sorts of frustration. If you need the security features of BIND 8
or 9 on all your name servers, for example, choose a platform that
supports BIND 8 or 9 for all your name servers.<p></p></dd>


<dt><i>Security</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-1286" /></a>Since you would undoubtedly prefer that
hackers not commandeer your name server to assist them in attacking
your own hosts or other networks across the Internet, it's
important to run your name server on a secure host. Don't run a
name server on a big, multiuser system if you can't trust its
users. If you have certain computers that are dedicated to hosting
network services but don't permit general logins, those are
good candidates for running name servers. If you have only one or a
few really secure hosts, consider running the primary master name
server on one of those, since its compromise would be more
significant than the compromise of the slaves.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


Though these are really secondary considerations -- it's
more important to have a name server on a given subnet than to have
it running on the perfect host -- do keep these criteria in mind
when making a choice.<a name="INDEX-1287" /></a></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-8-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.1.2. Capacity Planning</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1288" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1289" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1290" /></a>If you have heavily populated networks or
users who do a lot of name server-intensive work, you may find that
you need more name servers than we've recommended to handle the
load. Or our recommendations may be fine for a little while, but as
people add hosts to your nets or install new name server-intensive
programs, you may find your name servers bogged down by queries.</p><p>


Just which tasks are "name server-intensive"? Surfing the
<a name="INDEX-1291" /></a>Web can be name server-intensive. Sending
<a name="INDEX-1292" /></a>electronic mail, especially to large
mailing lists, can be name server-intensive. Programs that make lots
of <a name="INDEX-1293" /></a>remote procedure calls to different hosts
can be name server-intensive. Even running certain graphical user
environments can tax your name server. X Windows-based user
environments, for example, query the name server to check access
lists (among other things).</p><p>


The astute (and precocious) among you may be asking, "But how
do I know when my name servers are overloaded? What do I look
for?" An excellent question!</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1294" /></a>Memory
utilization is probably the most important aspect of a name
server's operation to monitor. <em class="filename">named </em>can
get very large on a name server that is authoritative for many zones.
If <em class="filename">named </em>'s size, plus the size of the
other processes you run, exceeds the size of your host's real
memory, your host may swap furiously ("thrash") and not
get anything done. Even if your host has more than enough memory to
run all its processes, large name servers are slow to start and slow
to spawn new <em class="filename">named</em> processes (e.g., to handle
zone transfers). Another problem, peculiar to BIND 4: since a BIND 4
name server<em class="filename"> </em>creates new
<em class="filename">named</em> processes to handle zone transfers,
it's quite possible to have more than one <em class="filename">named
</em>process running at one time -- one answering queries
and one or more servicing zone transfers. If your BIND 4 master name
server already consumes 5 or 10 megabytes of memory, count on two or
three times that amount being used occasionally.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1295" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1296" /></a>Another criterion you can use to measure
the load on your name server is the load the
<em class="filename">named</em> process places on the host's CPU.
Correctly configured name servers don't use much CPU time, so
high CPU usage is often symptomatic of a configuration error.
Programs such as <a name="INDEX-1297" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1298" /></a><em class="filename">top
</em>can help you characterize your name server's average
CPU utilization.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-54">[54]</a>
Unfortunately, there are no absolute rules when it comes to
acceptable CPU utilization. We offer a rough rule of thumb, though:
5% average CPU utilization is probably acceptable; 10% is a bit high,
unless the host is dedicated to providing name service.<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-54" /></a>[54]<em class="filename">top</em> is a very
handy program, written by Bill LeFebvre, that gives you a continuous
report of which processes are sucking up the most CPU time on your
host. The most recent version of <em class="filename">top</em> is
available via anonymous FTP from <a href="ftp://eecs.nwu.edu/">ftp://eecs.nwu.edu</a> as file
<em class="filename">/pub/top/top-3.4.tar.Z</em>.</p><p>

</blockquote>


To get an idea of what normal figures are, here's what
<em class="filename">top</em> might show for a relatively quiet name
server:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">last pid: 14299; load averages: 0.11, 0.12, 0.12       18:19:08
68 processes: 64 sleeping, 3 running, 1 stopped
Cpu states: 11.3% usr, 0.0% nice, 15.3% sys, 73.4% idle, 0.0% intr, 0.0% ker

   89 root       1    0  2968K 2652K sleep  5:01  0.00%  0.00% named</pre></blockquote>


Okay, that's <em class="emphasis">really</em> quiet. Here's
what <em class="filename">top</em> shows on a busy (though not overloaded)
name server:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">load averages: 0.30, 0.46, 0.44                  system: relay 16:12:20
39 processes: 38 sleeping, 1 waiting
Cpu states: 4.4% user, 0.0% nice, 5.4% system, 90.2% idle, 0.0% unk5, 0.0% unk6, 
0.0% unk7, 0.0% unk8

   PID USERNAME PRI NICE  SIZE   RES   STATE   TIME  WCPU   CPU  COMMAND
 21910 root       1    0  2624K  2616K sleep 146:21  0.00% 1.42% /etc/named</pre></blockquote>


<a name="INDEX-1299" /></a>Another
statistic to look at is the number of <a name="INDEX-1300" /></a>queries the name server receives per
minute (or second, if you have a busy name server). Again, there are
no absolutes here: a fast Pentium III running NetBSD can probably
handle thousands of queries per second without breaking a sweat,
while an older Unix host might have problems with more than a few
queries a second.</p><p>


To check the volume of queries your name server is receiving,
it's easiest to look at the name server's internal
<a name="INDEX-1301" /></a>statistics,
which you can configure the server to write to
<em class="emphasis">syslog</em><a name="INDEX-1302" /></a> at regular intervals.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-55">[55]</a>
For example, you could configure your name server to dump statistics
every hour (actually, that's the default for BIND 8 servers),
and compare the number of queries received between hours:<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-55" /></a>[55]Some
older BIND name servers need coercion to dump their statistics: the
ABRT signal (IOT on older systems). BIND 4.9 name servers
automatically dump stats every hour, but 4.9.4 through 4.9.7 name
servers, once again, need to be coerced with ABRT.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
        statistics-interval 60;
};</pre></blockquote>


BIND 9 name servers don't support the
<em class="emphasis">statistics-interval</em> substatement, but you can
use <em class="filename">rndc </em>to tell a BIND 9 name server to dump
statistics on the hour, for example in <em class="filename">crontab </em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">0 * * * *  /usr/local/sbin/rndc stats</pre></blockquote>


You should pay special attention to <a name="INDEX-1303" /></a>peak periods. Monday
morning is often busy, because many people like to respond to mail
they've received over the weekend first thing on Mondays.</p><p>


You might also want to take a sample starting just after lunch, when
people are returning to their desks and getting back to
work -- all at about the same time. Of course, if your
organization is spread across several time zones, you'll have
to use your own good judgment to determine a busy time.</p><p>


Here's a snippet from the <em class="emphasis">syslog</em> file on a
BIND 8.2.3 name server:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Aug  1 11:00:49 terminator named[103]: NSTATS 965152849 959476930 A=8 NS=1

The number of queries received is dumped in the
<a name="INDEX-1304" /></a><em class="emphasis">RQ</em> field (in
bold). To calculate the number of queries received in the hour, just
subtract the first <em class="emphasis">RQ</em> value from the second one:
458332 - 458031 = 301.</p><p>


Even if your host is fast enough to handle the number of queries it
receives, you should make sure that the <a name="INDEX-1305" /></a>DNS traffic isn't placing an undue
load on your network. On most <a name="INDEX-1306" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1307" /></a>LANs, DNS traffic is too
small a proportion of the network's bandwidth to worry about.
Over slow leased lines or dialup connections, though, DNS traffic
could consume enough bandwidth to merit concern.</p><p>


For a rough estimate of the volume of <a name="INDEX-1308" /></a>DNS
traffic on your LAN, multiply the number of queries received (RQ)
plus the number of answers sent (<a name="INDEX-1309" /></a>SAns) in an hour by 800 bits (100
bytes, a rough average size for a DNS message), and divide by 3600
(seconds per hour) to find the bandwidth utilized. This should give
you a feeling for how much of your network's bandwidth is
consumed by DNS traffic.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-56">[56]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-56" /></a>[56]For a nice package that
automates the analysis of BIND's statistics, look for Nigel
<a name="INDEX-1310" /></a>Campbell's

in the DNS Resources Directory's tools page, <a href="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/tools.html">http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/tools.html</a>.</p><p>

</blockquote>


To give you an idea of what's normal, the last
<a name="INDEX-1313" /></a>NSFNET traffic report (in April 1995)
showed that DNS traffic constituted just over 5% of the total traffic
volume (in bytes) on their backbone. The NSFNET's figures were
based upon actual traffic sampling, not calculations like ours using
the name server's statistics.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-57">[57]</a> If you want to get a more accurate idea of
the traffic your name server is receiving, you can always do your own
traffic sampling with a LAN protocol analyzer.<a name="INDEX-1314" /></a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-57" /></a>[57]We're not
sure how representative of the current state of the Internet these
numbers are, but it's extremely difficult to wheedle equivalent
numbers out of the commercial backbone providers that succeeded the
NSFNET.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<a name="INDEX-1315" /></a>Once <a name="INDEX-1316" /></a>you've found
that your name servers are overworked, what then? First, it's a
good idea to make sure your name servers aren't being bombarded
with queries by a misbehaving program. To do that, you'll need
to find out where all the queries are coming from.</p><p>


If you're running a BIND 4.9 or 8.1.2 name server, you can find
out which resolvers and name servers are querying your name server
just by dumping the statistics. These name servers keep statistics on
a host-by-host basis, which is really useful in tracking down heavy
users of your name server. BIND 8.2 or newer name servers don't
keep these statistics by default; to induce them to keep host-by-host
statistics, use the <em class="firstterm">host-statistics
</em>substatement in your <em class="emphasis">options</em>
statement, like this:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-58">[58]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-58" /></a>[58]BIND 9 doesn't support
the <em class="emphasis">host-statistics</em> substatement -- or
keeping per-host statistics, for that matter -- as of
9.1.0.</p><p>

For example, take these statistics:</p><p>

After the <em class="emphasis">Global</em> entry, each host is broken out
by IP address in brackets. Looking at the legend, you can see that
the first field in each record is RQ, or queries received. That gives
us a good reason to look at hosts 15.17.232.8, 15.17.232.16, and
15.17.232.94, which appear to be responsible for about 88% of our
queries.</p><p>


If you're running an older name server, the only way to find
out which resolvers and name servers are sending all those darned
queries is to turn on name server
<a name="INDEX-1317" /></a>debugging.
(We'll cover this in depth in <a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, "Reading BIND Debugging Output"</a>.)
All you're really interested in is the source IP addresses of
the queries your name server is receiving. When poring over the
debugging output, look for hosts sending repeated queries, especially
for the same or similar information. That may indicate a
misconfigured or buggy program running on the host, or a foreign name
server pelting your name server with queries.<a name="INDEX-1318" /></a></p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1319" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1320" /></a>If all the queries appear legitimate,
add a new name server. Don't put the name server just anywhere,
though; use the information from the debugging output to help you
decide where best to run one. In cases where DNS traffic is gobbling
up your Ethernet, it won't help to choose a host at random and
create a name server there. You need to consider which hosts are
sending all the queries, then figure out how to best provide them
name service. <a name="INDEX-1321" /></a>Here are some hints to help you
decide:</p><p>


<ul><li>Look for queries from resolvers on hosts that share the same file
server. You could run a name server on the file server.<p></p></li><li>Look for queries from resolvers on large, multiuser hosts. You could
run a name server there.<p></p></li><li>Look for queries from resolvers on another subnet. Those resolvers
should be configured to query a name server on their local subnet. If
there isn't one on that subnet, create one.<p></p></li><li>Look for queries from resolvers on the same bridged segment (assuming
you use bridging). If you run a name server on the bridged segment,
the traffic won't need to be bridged to the rest of the
network.<p></p></li><li>Look for queries from hosts connected to each other via another,
lightly loaded network. You could run a name server on the
other<a name="INDEX-1322" /></a>
network.<a name="INDEX-1323" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1324" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1325" /></a><p></p></li></ul>
