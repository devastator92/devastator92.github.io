<h2 class="sect1">1.5. Must I Use DNS?</h2>


<a name="INDEX-78" />Despite the usefulness of the Domain
Name System, there are still some situations in which it
doesn't pay to use it. There are other name resolution
mechanisms besides DNS, some of which may be a standard part of your
operating system. Sometimes the overhead involved in managing zones
and their name servers outweighs the benefits. On the other hand,
there are circumstances in which you have no other choice but to set
up and manage name servers. Here are some guidelines to help you make
that decision:</p><p>
<a name="INDEX-79" />

<dl>
<dt><i>If you're connected to the Internet . . . </i></dt>
<dd> . . . DNS is a must. Think of DNS as the
lingua franca of the Internet: nearly all of the Internet's
network services use DNS. That includes the World Wide Web,
electronic mail, remote terminal access, and file transfer.</p><p>

On the other hand, this doesn't necessarily mean that you have
to set up and run <a name="INDEX-80" />zones <em class="emphasis">by</em> yourself <em class="emphasis">for</em> yourself. If you have only a handful of
hosts, you may be able to find an existing zone to become part of
(see <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Where Do I Start?"</a> ). Or you may be able to find
someone else to host your zones for you. If you pay an Internet
service provider for your Internet connectivity, ask if they'll
host your zone for you, too. Even if you aren't already a
customer, there are companies who will help out, for a price.</p><p>


If you have a little more than a handful of hosts, or a lot more,
then you'll probably want your own zone. And if you want direct
control over your zone and your name servers, then you'll want
to manage it yourself. Read on!</p></dd>

<dt><i>If you have your own TCP/IP-based internet . . . </i></dt>
<dd>. . . you probably want DNS. By an
<a name="INDEX-81" />internet, we don't mean just a
single Ethernet of workstations using TCP/IP (see the next section
for that); we mean a fairly complex "network of
networks." Maybe you have a forest of Appletalk nets and a
handful of Apollo token rings.</p><p>
If your internet is basically homogeneous and your hosts don't
need DNS (say you have a big DECnet or OSI internet), then you may be
able to do without it. But if you've got a variety of hosts,
and especially if some of those run some variety of Unix,
you'll want DNS. It'll simplify the distribution of host
information and rid you of any kludgy host table distribution schemes
you may have cooked up.</p><p>
</dd>

<dt><i>If you have your own local area network or site network . . . </i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-82" /> . . .
and that network isn't connected to a larger network, you can
probably get away without using DNS. You might consider using
Microsoft's <a name="INDEX-83" />Windows Internet Name Service (WINS),
<a name="INDEX-84" />host tables, or Sun's
<a name="INDEX-85" /> <a name="INDEX-86" />Network
Information Service (NIS) product.</p><p>

But if you need distributed administration or have trouble
maintaining the consistency of data on your network, DNS may be for
you. And if your network is likely to be connected to another network
soon, like your corporate internet or the Internet itself,
you'd be wise to set up your zones now.</p><p>
