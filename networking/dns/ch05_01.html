<em>And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
herself, in a dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats
eat bats?" and sometimes "Do bats eat cats?" for,
you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it
didn't much matter which way she put it.</em></p><p>


<a name="INDEX-652" /></a> <a name="INDEX-653" /></a>I'll bet you're drowsy, too,
after that looong chapter. Thankfully, this chapter discusses a topic
that should be very interesting to you system administrators and
postmasters: how DNS impacts electronic mail. And even if it
isn't interesting to you, at least it's shorter than the
last chapter.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-654" /></a>One
of the advantages of the Domain Name System over
<a name="INDEX-655" /></a>host tables is its support of
advanced <a name="INDEX-656" /></a>mail
routing. When mailers had only the <em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em>
file (and its derivative, <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>) to work
with, the best they could do was to attempt delivery to a
host's IP address. If that failed, they could either defer
delivery of the message and try again later, or bounce the message
back to the sender.</p><p>


DNS offers a mechanism for specifying backup hosts for mail delivery,
and also for allowing hosts to assume mail handling responsibilities
for other hosts. This lets diskless hosts that don't run
mailers, for example, have mail addressed to them processed by their
server.</p><p>


DNS, unlike host tables, allows arbitrary names to represent
electronic mail destinations. You can -- and most organizations
on the Internet do -- use the domain name of your main
<a name="INDEX-657" /></a>forward-mapping zone as an
<a name="INDEX-658" /></a>email
destination. Or you can add domain names to your zone that are purely
email destinations and don't represent any particular host. A
single logical email destination may also represent several mail
servers. With host tables, mail destinations were hosts, period.</p><p>


Taken all together, these features give administrators much more
flexibility in configuring electronic mail on their networks.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-CHP-5-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">5.1. MX Records</h2>


<a name="INDEX-659" /></a>DNS uses a single type of resource
record to implement enhanced mail routing: the MX record. Originally,
the MX record's function was split between two records, the
<a name="INDEX-660" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-661" /></a>MD (mail destination) and
<a name="INDEX-662" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-663" /></a>MF (mail forwarder) records. MD
specified the final destination to which a message addressed to a
given domain name should be delivered; MF specified a host that would
forward mail on to the eventual destination, should that destination
be unreachable.</p><p>


Early experience with DNS on the ARPAnet showed that separating the
functions didn't work very well. A mailer needed both the MD
and MF records attached to a domain name (if both existed) to decide
where to send mail -- one or the other alone wouldn't do.
But an explicit lookup of one type or another (either MD or MF) would
cause a name server to cache just that record type. So mailers either
had to do two queries, one for MD and one for MF records, or they
could no longer accept cached answers. This meant that the overhead
of running mail was higher than that of running other services, which
was eventually deemed unacceptable.</p><p>


The two records were integrated into a single record type, MX, to
solve this problem. Now a mailer just needed all the MX records for a
particular domain name destination to make a mail routing decision.
Using cached MX records was fine, as long as the TTLs matched.</p><p>


MX records specify a <a name="INDEX-664" /></a> <a name="INDEX-665" /></a><em class="firstterm">mail exchanger</em> for
a domain name; this is a host that will process
<em class="emphasis">or</em> forward mail for the domain name (through a
firewall, for example). "<a name="INDEX-666" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-667" /></a>Processing"
the mail means either delivering it to the individual it's
addressed to or gatewaying it to another mail transport, like X.400
or Microsoft Exchange.
"<a name="INDEX-668" /></a>Forwarding"
means sending it to its final destination or to another mail
exchanger "closer" to the destination via SMTP, the
Internet's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Sometimes, forwarding
the mail involves queuing it for some amount of time, too.</p><p>


In order to prevent <a name="INDEX-669" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-670" /></a>mail
routing loops, the MX record has an extra parameter besides the
domain name of the mail exchanger: a <a name="INDEX-671" /></a><em class="firstterm">preference value</em>.
The preference value is an unsigned 16-bit number (between
and 65535) that indicates the mail exchanger's priority. For
example, the MX record:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">peets.mpk.ca.us.    IN    MX    10 relay.hp.com.</pre></blockquote>


specifies that <em class="emphasis">relay.hp.com</em>
is a mail exchanger for <em class="emphasis">peets.mpk.ca.us</em> at preference value 10.</p><p>


Taken together, the preference values of a destination's mail
exchangers determine the order in which a mailer should use them. The
preference value itself isn't important, only its relationship
to the values of other mail exchangers: is it higher or lower than
the values of this destination's other mail exchangers? Unless
there are other records involved:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">plange.puntacana.dr.  IN  MX  1 listo.puntacana.dr.
plange.puntacana.dr.  IN  MX  2 hep.puntacana.dr.</pre></blockquote>


does exactly the same thing as:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">plange.puntacana.dr.  IN  MX  50  listo.puntacana.dr.
plange.puntacana.dr.  IN  MX  100 hep.puntacana.dr.</pre></blockquote>


Mailers should attempt delivery to the mail exchangers with the
<em class="emphasis">lowest</em> preference values first. It may seems a
little counterintuitive at first that the most preferred mail
exchanger has the lowest preference value. But since the preference
value is an unsigned quantity, this lets you specify a
"best" mail exchanger at preference value 0.</p><p>


If delivery to the most preferred mail exchanger(s) fails, mailers
should attempt delivery to less preferred mail exchangers (those with
higher preference values) in order of increasing preference value.
That is, mailers should try more preferred mail exchangers before
they try less preferred mail exchangers. More than one mail exchanger
may share the same preference value, too, giving the mailer its
choice of which to send to first.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-28">[28]</a> The mailer must try all the mail exchangers at a given
preference value before proceeding to the next higher value.<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-28" /></a>[28]The newest version
of <em class="filename">sendmail</em>, Version 8, will actually choose
randomly among mail exchangers with the same preference.</p><p>

</blockquote>


For example, the MX records for <em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em>
might be:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">oreilly.com.    IN    MX    0  ora.oreilly.com.
oreilly.com.    IN    MX    10 ruby.oreilly.com.
oreilly.com.    IN    MX    10 opal.oreilly.com.</pre></blockquote>


Interpreted together, these MX records instruct mailers to attempt
delivery to <em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em> by
sending to:</p><p>


<ol><li><em class="emphasis">ora.oreilly.com</em> first<p></p></li><li>Either <em class="emphasis">ruby.oreilly.com</em> or
<em class="emphasis">opal.oreilly.com</em> next, and
finally<p></p></li><li>The remaining preference 10 mail exchanger (the one not used in step
2)<p></p></li></ol>
Of course, once the mailer successfully delivers the mail to one of
<em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em>'s mail
exchangers, it can stop. A mailer successfully delivering <em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em> mail to <em class="emphasis">ora.oreilly.com</em> doesn't need to
try <em class="emphasis">ruby.oreilly.com</em> or
<em class="emphasis">opal.oreilly.com</em>.</p><p>


Note that <em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em>
isn't a particular host; it's the domain name of
O'Reilly &amp; Associates' main <a name="INDEX-672" /></a>forward-mapping zone. O'Reilly &amp;
Associates uses the domain name as the email destination for everyone
who works there. It's much easier for correspondents to
remember the single email destination <em class="emphasis">oreilly.com</em> than to remember which
host -- <em class="emphasis">ruby.oreilly.com</em>?
<em class="emphasis">amber.oreilly.com</em>? -- each employee
has an email account on.</p><p>


This requires, of course, that the mailer on <em class="emphasis">ora.oreilly.com</em> keep track of which host
each user at O'Reilly &amp; Associates has an email account on.
That's usually done by maintaining a master
<em class="filename">aliases</em> file on <em class="emphasis">ora.oreilly.com</em> that forwards email from
<em class="emphasis">ora.oreilly.com</em> to its
eventual destination.</p><p>


What if a destination doesn't have any MX records, but it has
one or more <a name="INDEX-673" /></a>A records? Will a mailer
simply not deliver mail to that destination? Actually, you can
compile recent versions of
<a name="INDEX-674" /></a><em class="filename">sendmail</em>
to do just that. Most vendors, however, have compiled their
<em class="filename">sendmail</em>s to be more forgiving: if no MX records
exist but one or more A records do, they'll at least attempt
delivery to the address. Version 8 of <em class="filename">sendmail</em>
compiled "out of the box" will try the address of a mail
destination without MX records. Check your vendor's
documentation if you're not sure whether your mail server will
send mail to destinations with only address records. Even though
nearly all mailers deliver mail to a destination with just an address
record and no MX records, it's still a good idea to have at
least one MX record for each legitimate mail destination. When it has
mail to deliver, <em class="filename">sendmail</em> always looks up the MX
records for a destination <em class="emphasis">first</em>. If the
destination doesn't have any MX records, a name
server -- usually one of your authoritative name
servers -- still must answer that query, and then
<em class="filename">sendmail</em> goes on to look up A records. That
takes extra time, slows mail delivery, and adds a little load to your
zone's authoritative name servers. If you simply add an MX
record for each destination pointing to a domain name that maps to
the same address that an address lookup would return,
<em class="filename">sendmail</em> has to send only one query, and the
mailer's local name server caches the MX record for future
use.<a name="INDEX-675" /></a></p><p>
