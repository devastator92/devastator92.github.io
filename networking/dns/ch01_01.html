<em>The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?" he asked.</p><p>
"Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely,
"and go on till you come to the end: then stop."</em></p><p>


It's important to know a little
<a name="INDEX-10" /></a>ARPAnet history to
understand the Domain Name System. DNS was developed to address
particular problems on the ARPAnet, and the Internet -- a
descendant of the ARPAnet -- remains its main user.</p><p>


If you've been using the Internet for years, you can probably
skip this chapter. If you haven't, we hope it'll give you
enough background to understand what motivated the development of
DNS.</p><p>

      <h2 class="sect1"><a name="ahead-1"></a>1.1. A (Very) Brief History of the 
        Internet</h2>


<a name="INDEX-11" /></a>In the late 1960s, the U.S. Department of
Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA (later
<a name="INDEX-12" /></a>DARPA), began funding
the ARPAnet, an experimental wide area computer network that
connected important research organizations in the United States. The
original goal of the ARPAnet was to allow government contractors to
share expensive or scarce computing resources. From the beginning,
however, users of the ARPAnet also used the network for
collaboration. This collaboration ranged from sharing files and
software and exchanging electronic mail -- now
commonplace -- to joint development and research using shared
remote computers.</p><p>


The <a name="INDEX-13" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-14" /></a>TCP/IP
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite was
developed in the early 1980s and quickly became the standard
host-networking protocol on the ARPAnet. The inclusion of the
protocol suite in the University of California at Berkeley's
popular <a name="INDEX-15" /></a> <a name="INDEX-16" /></a>BSD
Unix operating system was instrumental in democratizing
internetworking. BSD Unix was virtually free to universities. This
meant that internetworking -- and ARPAnet connectivity -- was
suddenly available cheaply to many more organizations than were
previously attached to the ARPAnet. Many computers being connected to
the ARPAnet were connected to local area networks (LANs), too, and
very shortly the other computers on the LANs were communicating via
the ARPAnet as well.</p><p>


The network grew from a handful of hosts to tens of thousands of
hosts. The original ARPAnet became the backbone of a confederation of
local and regional networks based on TCP/IP, called the
<em class="emphasis">Internet</em>.</p><p>


In 1988, however, DARPA decided the experiment was over. The
Department of Defense began dismantling the ARPAnet. Another network,
funded by the National Science Foundation and called the
<a name="INDEX-17" /></a>NSFNET,
replaced the ARPAnet as the backbone of the Internet.</p><p>


Even more recently, in the spring of 1995, the Internet made a
transition from using the publicly funded NSFNET as a
<a name="INDEX-18" /></a>backbone to using
multiple commercial backbones, run by long-distance carriers like MCI
and Sprint, and long-time commercial internetworking players like
PSINet and UUNET.</p><p>


Today, the Internet connects millions of hosts around the world. In
fact, a significant proportion of the non-PC computers in the world
are connected to the Internet. Some of the new commercial backbones
can carry a volume of many gigabits per second, tens of thousands of
times the bandwidth of the original ARPAnet. Tens of millions of
people use the network for communication and collaboration daily.</p><p>
