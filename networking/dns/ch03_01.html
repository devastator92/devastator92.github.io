<em>"What do you call yourself?" the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet voice it had!</p><p>


"I wish I knew!" thought poor Alice. She answered, rather
sadly, "Nothing, just now."</p><p>


"Think again," it said: "that won't do."</p><p>


Alice thought, but nothing came of it. "Please, would you tell
me what you call yourself?" she said timidly. "I think
that might help a little."</p><p>


"I'll tell you, if you come a little further on,"
the Fawn said. "I can't remember here."</em></p><p>


Now that you understand the theory behind the Domain Name System, we
can attend to more practical matters. Before you set up your zones,
you may need to get the BIND software. Usually, it's included
as a standard part of most Unix-based operating systems. Often,
though, you'll want to seek out a more recent version with all
the latest functionality and security enhancements.</p><p>


Once you've got BIND, you need to decide on a domain name for
your main zone -- which may not be quite as easy as it sounds,
since it entails finding an appropriate place in the Internet
namespace. That decided, you need to contact the administrators of
the parent of the zone whose domain name you've chosen.</p><p>


One thing at a time, though. Let's talk about where to get BIND.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-CHP-3-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">3.1. Getting BIND</h2>


<a name="INDEX-245" /></a> <a name="INDEX-246" /></a> <a name="INDEX-247" /></a>If
you plan to set up your own zones and run name servers for them,
you'll need the BIND software first. Even if you're
planning on having someone else host your zones, it's helpful
to have the software around. For example, you can use your local name
server to test your data files before giving them to the
administrator of your remote name servers.</p><p>


Most commercial <a name="INDEX-248" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-249" /></a>Unix vendors ship
BIND with the rest of their standard TCP/IP networking software. And
the networking software is usually included with the operating
system, so you get BIND free. Even if the networking software is
priced separately, you've probably already bought it, since you
clearly do enough networking to need DNS, right?</p><p>


If you don't have a version of BIND for your flavor of Unix,
though, or if you want the latest, greatest version, you can always
get the source code. As luck would have it, it's freely
distributed. The source code for the most up-to-date versions of BIND
as of this writing (the BIND 8.2.3 and 9.1.0 releases) is available
via anonymous <a name="INDEX-250" /></a>FTP from the
Internet Software Consortium's web site,
ftp.isc.org, in
<em class="emphasis">/isc/bind/src/cur/bind-8/bind-src.tar.gz</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/isc/bind9/9.1.0/bind-9.1.0.tar.gz,
</em>respectively. Compiling these releases on most common Unix
platforms is relatively straightforward.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-17">[17]</a> The ISC includes a list of Unix-ish operating systems
that BIND is known to compile on in the file
<em class="filename">src/INSTALL</em>, including several versions of
Linux, Digital Unix, and Solaris 2. There's also a list of
other Unix-ish and not-so-Unix-ish (MPE, anyone?) operating systems
that BIND has supported in the past and that these most recent
versions of BIND will probably compile on without much
effort.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-18">[18]</a>
Regardless of which category your operating system falls into, we
strongly recommend reading all of the sections of
<em class="filename">src/INSTALL</em> relevant to your OS. We also include
instructions on compiling BIND 8.2.3 and 9.1.0 on RedHat Linux 6.2 as
<a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Compiling and Installing BIND on Linux"</a>. It's a remarkably short appendix.<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-17" /></a>[17]Compiling
early versions of BIND 9 (before 9.1.0) can be a little tricky, since
these versions require <em class="filename">pthreads </em>and many OSes
sport broken <em class="filename">pthreads </em>implementations. BIND
9.1.0 and later can be built without <em class="filename">pthreads </em>by
running <em class="filename">configure - -disable-threads</em>.</p><p>

</blockquote><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-18" /></a>[18]We know for a fact that BIND 8.2.3 compiles
cleanly on several of these operating systems.</p><p>

</blockquote>


Some of you may already have a version of <a name="INDEX-251" /></a>BIND that came with your operating system,
but you're wondering whether you need the latest, greatest
version of BIND. What does it have to offer that earlier versions of
BIND don't? Here's an overview:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>Security fixes</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-252" /></a>Arguably
the most important reason to run the newest BIND is that only the
most recent versions are patched against most attacks, some of them
widely known. BIND 8.2.3 and BIND 9.1.0 are resistant to all
well-known attacks, while BIND 4.9.8 can withstand an important
subset of them. Earlier versions of BIND have many widely known
vulnerabilities. If you're running a name server on the
Internet, we strongly recommend that you run BIND 8.2.3, BIND 9.1.0,
at the very least BIND 4.9.8, or whatever the current released
version is as you read this.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Security features</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-253" /></a>BIND 8 and
BIND 9 support access lists on queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates. BIND 4.9 servers support access lists on queries and zone
transfers, and earlier versions of BIND don't support access
lists at all. Certain name servers, particularly those running on
bastion hosts or other security-critical hosts, may require these
features.</p><p>


We cover these features in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Security"</a>.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>DNS UPDATE</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-254" /></a>BIND 8 and BIND 9 support the
<a name="INDEX-255" /></a>Dynamic Update standard described in RFC
2136. This allows authorized agents to update zone data by sending
special update messages to add or delete resource records. BIND 4
servers don't support Dynamic Update.</p><p>


We cover Dynamic Update in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>DNS NOTIFY</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-256" /></a>BIND 8 and BIND 9 support
<a name="INDEX-257" /></a>zone change
notification, which allows the primary master name server for a zone
to notify the zone's slaves when the serial number has
incremented. BIND 4 servers don't support NOTIFY.</p><p>


We describe NOTIFY in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Incremental zone transfer</i></dt>
<dd>BIND 8.2.3 and BIND 9 support <a name="INDEX-258" /></a> <a name="INDEX-259" /></a> <a name="INDEX-260" /></a>incremental zone transfer, which
allows slave name servers to request just the changes to a zone from
their master servers. This makes zone transfers faster and more
efficient, and is particularly important for large, dynamic zones.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Configuration syntax</i></dt>
<dd>The <a name="INDEX-261" /></a>configuration syntax used by BIND 8 and
BIND 9 is completely different from BIND 4's. While the new
configuration syntax is more flexible and more powerful, it also
requires learning a brand-new system for configuring BIND. But then,
you have this book to help you through that.</p><p>


We introduce the BIND 8 and BIND 9 configuration syntax in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, and describe it throughout the rest of the
book.<p></p></dd>

</dl>


We've also provided a summary of the capabilities of four
popular versions of BIND (4.9.8, 8.1.2, 8.2.3, and 9.1.0) as <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "BIND Compatibility Matrix"</a>. If you're not sure which version is
right for you or if you need some exotic BIND feature you're
not sure is supported yet in BIND 9, take a look at the appendix.</p><p>


If, after reading through this list and checking the appendix,
you're convinced you need BIND 8 or BIND 9's features and
neither a BIND 8 nor BIND 9 name server comes with your operating
system, download the source code and build your own.</p><p>

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.1. Handy Mailing Lists and Usenet Newsgroups</h3>


<a name="INDEX-262" /></a>Instructions
on how to port BIND to every other version of Unix could consume
another book this size, so we'll have to refer you to the
<a name="INDEX-263" /></a>BIND users mailing list
(<em class="email">bind-users@isc.org </em>) or the corresponding
<a name="INDEX-264" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-265" /></a>Usenet newsgroup (<em class="emphasis">comp.protocols.dns.bind</em>) for further help.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-19">[19]</a> For
BIND 9, there's a separate mailing list,
<em class="email">bind9-users@isc.org</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-20">[20]</a> The folks who read and contribute to
the BIND users mailing lists can be enormously helpful in your
porting efforts. Before sending mail to the list asking whether a
particular port is available, though, be sure to check the searchable
archive of the mailing list at
<a href="http://www.isc.org/ml-archives/bind-users">http://www.isc.org/ml-archives/bind-users</a>. Also,
take a look at the ISC's BIND web page at <a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND">http://www.isc.org/products/BIND</a><a name="INDEX-266" /></a>
for notes or links specific to your operating system, and check
Andras Salamon's DNS Resource Directory for precompiled BIND
<a name="INDEX-267" /></a>software.
The directory currently has a short list of precompiled binaries at
<a href="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/bind.html">http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/bind.html</a>.<p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-19" /></a>[19]To ask a question on an Internet mailing list,
all you need to do is send a message to the mailing list's
address. If you'd like to join the list, however, you have to
send a message to the list's maintainer first, requesting that
he or she add your electronic mail address to the list. Don't
send this request to the list itself -- that's considered
rude. The Internet convention is that you can reach the maintainer of
a mailing list by sending mail to <em class="email">list-request@domain</em>,
where <em class="email">list@domain</em> is the address of the mailing list.
So, for example, you can reach the BIND users mailing list's
administrator by sending mail to
<em class="email">bind-users-request@isc.org</em>.</p><p>

</blockquote><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-20" /></a>[20]Most of the BIND
9 developers read the <em class="emphasis">bind9-users</em> mailing list
exclusively.</p><p>

</blockquote>


Another mailing list you might be interested in is the<em class="emphasis">
namedroppers</em> list. Folks on the
<a name="INDEX-268" /></a><em class="emphasis">namedroppers</em> mailing
list are involved in the IETF working group that develops extensions
to the <a name="INDEX-269" /></a>DNS specifications, DNSEXT. For example,
the discussion of a new, proposed DNS record type would probably take
place on <em class="emphasis">namedroppers</em> instead of the BIND
mailing list. For more information on DNSEXT's charter, see
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/dnsext-charter.html">http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/dnsext-charter.html</a>.</p><p>


The address for the <em class="emphasis">namedroppers</em> mailing list is
<em class="email">namedroppers@ops.ietf.org</em>, and it is gatewayed
into the Internet newsgroup <em class="emphasis">comp.protocols.dns.std</em>. To join the
<em class="emphasis">namedroppers</em> mailing list, send mail to
<em class="email">namedroppers-request@ops.ietf.org</em> with the text
"subscribe namedroppers" as the body of the message.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-3-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.2. Finding IP Addresses</h3>


<a name="INDEX-270" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-271" /></a>You'll
notice that we gave you a number of domain names of hosts that have
FTPable software, and that the mailing lists we mentioned include
domain names. That should underscore the importance of DNS: see what
valuable software and advice you can get with the help of DNS?
Unfortunately, it's also something of a chicken-and-egg
problem: you can't send email to an address with a domain name
in it unless you've got DNS set up, so how can you ask someone
on the list how to set DNS up?</p><p>


Well, we could give you the IP addresses for all the hosts we
mentioned, but since IP addresses change often (in publishing
timescales, anyway), we'll show you how you can
<em class="emphasis">temporarily</em> use someone else's name server
to find the information instead. As long as your host has Internet
connectivity and the <a name="INDEX-272" /></a><em class="emphasis">nslookup</em> program,
you can retrieve information from the Internet namespace. To look up
the IP address for <em class="emphasis">ftp.isc.org</em>, for example, you
could use:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup ftp.isc.org. 207.69.188.185</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


This instructs <em class="emphasis">nslookup</em> to query the name server
running on the host at the IP address 207.69.188.185 to find the IP
address for <em class="emphasis">ftp.isc.org</em>, and should produce
output like:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Server:  ns1.mindspring.com
Address:  207.69.188.185

Name:    isrv4.pa.vix.com
Address: 204.152.184.27
Aliases:  ftp.isc.org</pre></blockquote>


Now you can FTP to ftp.isc.org's IP address, 204.152.184.27.</p><p>


How did we know that the host at IP address 207.69.188.185 runs a
name server? Our ISP, Mindspring, told us -- it's one of
their name servers. If your ISP provides name servers for its
customers' use (and most do), use one of them. If your ISP
doesn't provide name servers (shame on them!), you can
<em class="emphasis">temporarily</em> use one of the name servers listed
in this book. As long as you use it only to look up a few IP
addresses or other data, the administrators probably won't
mind. It's considered very rude, however, to point your
resolver or query tool at someone else's name server
permanently.</p><p>


Of course, if you already have access to a host with Internet
connectivity <em class="emphasis">and</em> DNS configured, you can use it
to FTP the stuff you need.</p><p>


Once you've got a working version of BIND, you're ready
to start thinking about your domain name.<a name="INDEX-273" /></a> <a name="INDEX-274" /></a> <a name="INDEX-275" /></a></p><p>
