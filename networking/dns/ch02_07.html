<h2 class="sect1">2.7. Caching</h2>


<a name="INDEX-234" />
<a name="INDEX-235" />The whole resolution process
may seem awfully convoluted and cumbersome to someone accustomed to
simple searches through the host table. Actually, though, it's
usually quite fast. One of the features that speeds it up
considerably is <em class="emphasis">caching</em>.</p><p>


A name server processing a recursive query may have to send out quite
a few queries to find an answer. However, it discovers a lot of
information about the domain name space as it does so. Each time
it's referred to another list of name servers, it learns that
those name servers are authoritative for some zone, and it learns the
addresses of those servers. And at the end of the resolution process,
when it finally finds the data the original querier sought, it can
store that data for future reference. With Version 4.9 and all
Version 8 and 9 BINDs, name servers even implement
<a name="INDEX-236" /><em class="emphasis">negative caching</em>:
if an authoritative name server responds to a query with an answer
that says the domain name or datatype in the query doesn't
exist, the local name server will temporarily cache that information,
too. Name servers cache all this data to help speed up successive
queries. The next time a resolver queries the name server for data
about a domain name the name server knows something about, the
process is shortened quite a bit. If the name server has cached the
answer, positive or negative, it simply returns the answer to the
resolver. Even if it doesn't have the answer cached, it may
have learned the identities of the name servers that are
authoritative for the zone the domain name is in and be able to query
them directly.</p><p>


For example, say our name server has already looked up the address
<em class="emphasis">eecs.berkeley.edu</em>. In the process, it cached the
names and addresses of the <em class="emphasis">eecs.berkeley.edu</em> and
<em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em> name servers (plus
<em class="emphasis">eecs.berkeley.edu</em>'s IP address). Now if a
resolver were to query our name server for the address of
<em class="emphasis">baobab.cs.berkeley.edu</em>, our name server could
skip querying the <a name="INDEX-237" />root
name servers. Recognizing that <em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em> is
the closest ancestor of <em class="emphasis">baobab.cs.berkeley.edu</em>
that it knows about, our name server would start by querying a
<em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em> name server, as shown in <a href="ch02_07.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-16">Figure 2-16</a>. On the other hand, if our name server had
discovered that there was no address for
<em class="emphasis">eecs.berkeley.edu</em>, the next time it receives a
query for the address, it could simply respond appropriately from its
cache.</p><p>

In addition to speeding up resolution, caching obviates a name
server's need to query the root name servers to answer queries
it can't answer locally. This means that it's not as
dependent on the roots, and the roots won't suffer as much from
all its queries.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.7.1. Time to Live</h3>


Name servers can't cache data forever, of course. If they did,
changes to that data on the authoritative name servers would never
reach the rest of the network. Remote name servers would just
continue to use cached data. Consequently, the administrator of the
zone that contains the data decides on a <a name="INDEX-238" /> <a name="INDEX-239" /> <a name="INDEX-240" /><em class="emphasis">time to live</em>,
or TTL, for the data. The time to live is the amount of time that any
name server is allowed to cache the data. After the time to live
expires, the name server must discard the cached data and get new
data from the authoritative name servers. This also applies to
negatively cached data; a name server must time out a negative answer
after a period, too, in case new data has been added on the
authoritative name servers.</p><p>


Deciding on a time to live for your data is essentially deciding on a
trade-off between
<a name="INDEX-241" />performance and consistency. A small TTL
helps ensure that data in your zones is consistent across the
network, because remote name servers will time it out more quickly
and be forced to query your authoritative name servers more often for
new data. On the other hand, it tends to increase the load on your
name servers and lengthen resolution time for information in your
zones.</p><p>


A large TTL shortens the average time it takes to resolve information
in your zones because the data can be cached longer. The drawback is
that your information will be inconsistent for a longer time if you
make changes to your data on your name servers.</p><p>


But enough of this theory -- you're probably antsy to get on
with this. There's some homework necessary before you can set
up your zones and your name servers, though, and we'll assign
it in the next<a name="INDEX-242" /> <a name="INDEX-243" /> chapter.<a name="INDEX-244" /></p><p>
