<h2 class="sect1">16.8. DNS and Windows 2000</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2443" /> <a name="INDEX-2444" />Windows 2000 can use standard dynamic
updates to register hosts in DNS. For a Windows 2000 client,
<em class="firstterm">registration</em> means adding a name-to-address
mapping and an address-to-name mapping for that client, information
Windows clients formerly registered with WINS servers. For a Windows
2000 server, registration involves adding records to a zone to tell
clients which services it's running and where (on which host
and port). For example, a Windows 2000 Domain Controller uses dynamic
update to add an SRV record telling Windows 2000 clients where the
Windows 2000 domain's Kerberos service is running.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.8.1. How Windows 2000 Uses Dynamic Update</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2445" />So
what gets added when a client registers? Let's reboot a Windows
2000 client in the Special Effects Lab and see.</p><p>


Our client is called <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em>. It has the fixed IP
address 192.253.254.13 (it doesn't get its address from our
DHCP server). At boot time, the dynamic update routines on the client
go through the following steps:</p><p>


<ol><li>Look up the SOA record for <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em> on the local name
server. Though there isn't an SOA record for that domain name,
the authority section of the response includes the SOA record of the
zone that contains <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em>, which is <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em>.</p></li><li>Look up the address of the name server in the MNAME field of the SOA
record, <em class="emphasis">bladerunner.fx.movie.edu</em>.</p></li><li>Send a dynamic update to <em class="emphasis">bladerunner.fx.movie.edu</em> with two
prerequisites: that <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em>isn't an alias (i.e., doesn't own a CNAME
record) and that it doesn't already have an address record
pointing to 192.253.254.13. The dynamic update contains no update
section; it's just a probe to see what's out there.</p></li><li>If <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em>already points to its address, stop. Otherwise, send
another dynamic update to <em class="emphasis">bladerunner.fx.movie.edu</em> with the
prerequisites that <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em>isn't an alias and doesn't have an address
record already. If the prerequisites are satisfied, the update adds
an address record pointing <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em> to 192.253.254.13. If
<em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em> already
has an address record, the client sends an update to delete that
address record and add its own.</p></li><li>Look up the SOA record for <em class="emphasis">254.253.192.in-addr.arpa</em>.</p></li><li>Look up the address of the name server in the MNAME field of the SOA
record (though since the MNAME field contains <em class="emphasis">bladerunner.fx.movie.edu</em>, which we
looked up recently, and Windows 2000 has a caching resolver, this
shouldn't require another query).</p></li><li>Send a dynamic update to <em class="emphasis">bladerunner.fx.movie.edu</em> with the
prerequisite that <em class="emphasis">13.254.253.192.in-addr.arpa</em> isn't
an alias. If the prerequisite is satisfied, the update adds a PTR
record mapping 192.253.254.13 back to <em class="emphasis">mummy.fx.movie.edu</em>. If <em class="emphasis">13.254.253.192.in-addr.arpa</em> is an alias,
stop.</p></li></ol>
If we'd been using the Microsoft DHCP Server from Windows 2000,
the DHCP server, by default, would have added the PTR record.
There's also an option in the DHCP server's MMC-based
management interface that allows the administrator to specify that
the DHCP server add both the PTR record and the A record. If the DHCP
server had added the A record, though, it wouldn't have set a
prerequisite.</p><p>


Servers, particularly Windows 2000 Domain Controllers, register lots
of information in DNS using dynamic update, both when they're
first set up and periodically thereafter. (The
<em class="emphasis">netlogon</em> service, for example, registers its SRV
records <em class="emphasis">hourly</em> !) This allows clients to locate
services on whichever host and port they're running. Since we
just set up a Windows 2000 domain called <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em>, let's take a look at
the records that our Domain Controller, <em class="emphasis">matrix.fx.movie.edu</em>, added:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">$ORIGIN fx.movie.edu.
@                         600       A       192.253.254.14
_kerberos._tcp.dc._msdcs  600       SRV     0 100 88   matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs      600       SRV     0 100 389  matrix.fx.movie.edu.

gc._msdcs                 600       A       192.253.253.14
_ldap._tcp.gc._msdcs      600       SRV     0 100 3268 matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_ldap._tcp.pdc._msdcs     600       SRV     0 100 389  matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_gc._tcp                  600       SRV     0 100 3268 matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_kerberos._tcp            600       SRV     0 100 88   matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_kpasswd._tcp             600       SRV     0 100 464  matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_ldap._tcp                600       SRV     0 100 389  matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_kerberos._udp            600       SRV     0 100 88   matrix.fx.movie.edu.
_kpasswd._udp             600       SRV     0 100 464  matrix.fx.movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


Whoa! That's a lot of records!</p><p>


These records tell Windows 2000 clients where the services offered by
the Domain Controller, including Kerberos and LDAP, are
running.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-107">[107]</a> You can see from the SRV records that
they're all running on <em class="emphasis">matrix.fx.movie.edu</em>, our only Domain
Controller. If we had another Domain Controller, you'd see
nearly twice as many SRV records.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-107" />[107]For an explanation of the function of each
of these records, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article
Q178169.</p><p>

</blockquote>


The owner names of all the SRV records end in <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em>, the name of the Windows
2000 domain. If we'd called our Windows 2000 domain <em class="emphasis">effects.movie.edu</em>, the dynamic update
routines would have updated the zone containing the domain name
<em class="emphasis">effects.movie.edu</em>,
<em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>. Of course, that
would really clutter up <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>, since it has other delegated
subdomains running Windows 2000. Consequently, we made sure we named
our Windows 2000 domain after our zone.</p><p>

<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.8.2. Problems with Windows 2000 and BIND</h3>


While Microsoft's decision to replace WINS with DNS was noble,
the implementation poses some problems for folks who run
<a name="INDEX-2446" />BIND name servers. First, Windows 2000
clients and DHCP servers have a nasty habit of deleting address
records owned by the same domain name as the clients or servers. For
example, if we let the users in the Special Effects Lab configure
their own computers and choose their computers' names, and one
user happened to use a name that was already taken, maybe by one of
our rendering servers, his computer would try to delete the
conflicting address record (that of the rendering server) and add its
own. That's not very sociable.</p><p>


Luckily, that behavior can be corrected on the client. The client
does, in fact, check to see whether the domain name it's using
already owns an address record by setting the prerequisite in step 4.
(It just deletes it if it does exist, by default.) But you can follow
the instructions in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q246804 to tell
the client not to delete conflicting records. The price? A client
can't differentiate between an address being used by a
different host with the same domain name and an address that formerly
belonged to it, so if the client changes addresses, it can't
automatically update the zone.</p><p>


If you elect to have your DHCP server handle all registration, you
don't have the option of leaving conflicting addresses alone.
The DHCP server doesn't use prerequisites to detect collisions;
it just unceremoniously deletes conflicting address records.</p><p>


Given the limitations of having the DHCP server handle all of the
registering, why would anyone consider it? Because if you allow any
client to register itself and you can only use primitive, IP
address-based access lists to authorize dynamic updates, you are
allowing <em class="emphasis">any client's address</em> to
dynamically update your zones. Savvier users of those clients could
easily fire off a few custom-made dynamic updates to change your
zone's MX records or the address of your web server.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.8.3. Secure Dynamic Update</h3>


Surely Microsoft doesn't just live with these problems, right?
No, not with the Microsoft DNS Server. The Microsoft DNS Server
supports GSS-TSIG, a dialect of TSIG (which we covered in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Security"</a>). A client that uses GSS-TSIG retrieves a TSIG
key from a Kerberos server, then uses it to sign a dynamic update.
The use of GSS, the Generic Security Service, to retrieve the key
means that an administrator doesn't need to hardcode a key on
each of his clients.</p><p>


Since the name of the TSIG key the client uses to sign the update is
just the domain name of the client, the name server can make sure
that only the client that added an address can delete it later,
simply by tracking the domain name of the TSIG key used to add a
given record. Only an updater with the same TSIG key is allowed to
delete that record.</p><p>


Windows 2000 clients try <a name="INDEX-2447" />GSS-<a name="INDEX-2448" />TSIG-signed dynamic updates if their
unsigned dynamic updates are refused. You can also configure them to
send signed updates first by following the instructions in Knowledge
Base article Q246804, mentioned earlier.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.8.3.1. BIND and GSS-TSIG</h3>


Unfortunately, <a name="INDEX-2449" />BIND name servers don't yet support
GSS-TSIG, so you can't use Windows 2000's secure dynamic
update with BIND. A forthcoming version of BIND 9, however, is
scheduled to support GSS-TSIG. Once BIND does support GSS-TSIG,
you'll be able to use all of the update policy rules described
in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a> to control which keys can update
which records. A simple set of rules that says:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">zone "fx.movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db.fx.movie.edu";
	update-policy {
		grant *.fx.movie.edu. self *.fx.movie.edu. A;
		grant matrix.fx.movie.edu. self matrix.fx.movie.edu. ANY;
		grant matrix.fx.movie.edu. subdomain fx.movie.edu. SRV;
	};
};</pre></blockquote>


may be enough to let Windows 2000 clients and servers register what
they need in your zone.<a name="INDEX-2450" /></p><p>
</div>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.8.4. What to Do?</h3>


In the meantime, how do you handle the proliferation of Windows 2000
on your network? Well, Microsoft would advise you to
"upgrade" all of your name servers to the Windows 2000
version of the Microsoft DNS Server. But if you like BIND -- and
we do -- you'd probably like some other options.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.8.4.1. Handling Windows 2000 clients</h3>


The first (and probably most common) option for handling your Windows
2000 clients is to create a delegated subdomain for all of them to
live in. We might call ours <em class="emphasis">win.fx.movie.edu</em>. Within <em class="emphasis">win.fx.movie.edu</em>, anything goes: clients
can stomp on other clients' addresses and someone may send a
bunch of hand-crafted dynamic updates to add bogus records to the
zone. The intent is to create a sandbox (or jail, if you prefer) that
the clients can't break out of and that they can trash if they
want to. If you have kids, you have an intuitive understanding of
this concept.</p><p>


By default, a Windows 2000 client will try to register itself in a
forward-mapping zone with the same name as its Windows 2000 domain.
So we'll have to do some extra configuration to tell our
clients to register in <em class="emphasis">win.fx.movie.edu</em>instead of in <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em>. In particular, we'll
have to go to a window that resides at <em class="emphasis">My
Computer-&gt;Properties-&gt;Network
Identification-&gt;Properties-&gt;More</em>, uncheck
<em class="emphasis">Change primary DNS suffix when domain membership
changes</em>, and type <em class="emphasis">win.fx.movie.edu</em> in the field labeled
<em class="emphasis">Primary DNS suffix of this computer</em>. On
<em class="emphasis">all</em> our clients.</p><p>


Another possibility is to leave your clients in your main production
zone (for our lab, that's <em class="emphasis">fx.movie.edu</em>) but to allow dynamic
updates only from the address of the DHCP server. Then you configure
your DHCP server to assume responsibility for maintaining both A
records and PTR records. (You can add A and PTR records for hosts
that don't use DHCP manually.)</p><p>


In this scenario, it's more difficult for the little imps to
send their custom dynamic updates to your name server, since it
involves spoofing the address of the DHCP server. It's still
possible that someone will bring up a client with a domain name that
conflicts with an existing domain name in the zone, though.</p><p>
</div>



<a name="dns4-CHP-16-SECT-8.4.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.8.4.2. Handling Windows 2000 servers</h3>


The main server you need to accommodate is the Domain Controller (or
Controllers, if you have more than one). The DC wants to add the
passel of SRV records we showed earlier. If it can't add them
at setup time, it'll write the records, in master file format,
to a file called <em class="filename">System32\Config\netlogon.dns</em>
under the system root.</p><p>


First, you'll need to determine which zone you need to update.
That's just a matter of finding the zone that would contain the
Windows 2000 domain name. If your Windows 2000 domain has the same
name as an existing zone, of course, that's the zone to update.
Otherwise, just keep stripping off the leading labels of your Windows
2000 domain until you get to the domain name of a zone.</p><p>


Once you've got the zone that you need to update, you need to
decide how to proceed. If you don't mind letting your Domain
Controller dynamically update your zone, just add an appropriate
<em class="emphasis">allow-update</em> substatement to the
<em class="emphasis">zone</em> statement and you're done. If
you'd rather not allow your DC complete control of the zone,
you can leave dynamic updates disabled and let the DC create the
<em class="filename">netlogon.dns</em> file. Then use an $INCLUDE control
statement to read the contents of the file into your zone data file:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">$INCLUDE netlogon.dns</pre></blockquote>


If neither of these options appeals to you, because you want the DC
to be able to change its SRV records but don't want it mangling
your zone, you've still got a trick up your sleeve. You can
take advantage of the funny format of the owner names in SRV records
and create delegated subdomains called (in our case) <em class="emphasis">_udp.fx.movie.edu</em>, <em class="emphasis">_tcp.fx.movie.edu</em>, <em class="emphasis">_sites.fx.movie.edu</em>, and <em class="emphasis">_msdcs.fx.movie.edu</em>. We'll have to
turn off name checking for <em class="emphasis">_msdcs.fx.movie.edu</em>, since the Domain
Controller wants to add an address record to the zone in addition to
a slew of SRV records. Then let the DC dynamically update these
zones, but not your main zone:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">acl dc { 192.253.254.13; };

zone "_udp.fx.movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db._udp.fx.movie.edu";
	allow-update { dc; };
};

zone "_tcp.fx.movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db._tcp.fx.movie.edu";
	allow-update { dc; };
};

zone "_sites.fx.movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db._udp.fx.movie.edu";
	allow-update { dc; };
};

zone "_msdcs.fx.movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db._udp.fx.movie.edu";
	allow-update { dc; };
	check-names ignore;
};</pre></blockquote>


Now you've got the best of both worlds: dynamic registration of
services with a safe production zone.<a name="INDEX-2451" /> <a name="INDEX-2452" /></p><p>
