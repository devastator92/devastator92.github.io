<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>


You may not know much about the<a name="INDEX-1" /> Domain Name
System -- yet -- but whenever you use the Internet, you
 use
DNS. Every time you send electronic mail or surf the World Wide Web,
you rely on the Domain Name System.</p><p>


You see, while you, as a human being, prefer to remember the
<em class="emphasis">names</em> of computers, computers like to address
each other by number. On an internet, that number is 32 bits long, or
between zero and four billion or so.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> That's easy
for a computer to remember because computers have lots of memory
ideal for storing numbers, but it isn't nearly as easy for us
humans. Pick 10 phone numbers out of the phone book at random and
then try to remember them. Not easy? Now flip to the front of the
phone book and attach random area codes to the phone numbers.
That's about how difficult it would be to remember 10 arbitrary
internet addresses.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" />[1]And, with IP
Version 6, it's a whopping 128 bits long, or between zero and a
decimal number with 39 digits.</p><p>

</blockquote>


This is part of the reason we need the Domain Name System. DNS
handles mapping between host names, which we humans find convenient,
and between internet addresses, which computers deal with. In fact,
DNS is the standard mechanism on the Internet for advertising and
accessing all kinds of information about hosts, not just addresses.
And DNS is used by virtually all internetworking software, including
electronic mail, remote terminal programs such as Telnet, file
transfer programs such as FTP, and web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p><p>


Another important feature of DNS is that it makes host information
available all over the Internet. Keeping information about hosts in a
formatted file on a single computer only helps users on that
computer. DNS provides a means of retrieving information remotely
from anywhere on the network.</p><p>


More than that, DNS lets you distribute the management of host
information among many sites and organizations. You don't need
to submit your data to some central site or periodically retrieve
copies of the "master" database. You simply make sure
your section, called a <em class="emphasis">zone</em>, is up to date on
your <em class="emphasis">name servers</em>. Your name servers make your
zone's data available to all the other name servers on the
network.</p><p>


Because the database is distributed, the system also needs the
ability to locate the data you're looking for by searching a
number of possible locations. The Domain Name System gives name
servers the intelligence to navigate through the database and find
data in any zone.</p><p>


Of course, DNS does have a few problems. For example, the system
allows more than one name server to store data about a zone, for
redundancy's sake. But inconsistencies can crop up between
copies of the zone data.</p><p>


But the <em class="emphasis">worst</em> problem with DNS is that despite
its widespread use on the Internet, there's really very little
<a name="INDEX-2" />documentation about managing and
maintaining it. Most administrators on the Internet make do with the
documentation their vendors see fit to provide and with whatever they
can glean from following the Internet mailing lists and Usenet
newsgroups on the subject.</p><p>


This lack of documentation means that the understanding of an
enormously important internet service -- one of the linchpins of
today's Internet -- is either handed down from administrator
to administrator like a closely guarded family recipe, or relearned
repeatedly by isolated programmers and engineers. New administrators
of zones suffer through the same mistakes made by countless others.</p><p>


Our aim with this book is to help remedy this situation. We realize
that not all of you have the time or the desire to become DNS
experts. Most of you, after all, have plenty to do besides managing
your zones and name servers: system administration, network
engineering, or software development. It takes an awfully big
institution to devote a whole person to DNS. We'll try to give
you enough information to let you do what you need to do, whether
that's running a small zone or managing a multinational
monstrosity, tending a single name server or shepherding a hundred of
them. Read as much as you need to know now, and come back later if
you need to learn more.</p><p>


DNS is a big topic -- big enough to require two authors,
anyway -- and we've tried to present it as sensibly and
understandably as possible. The first two chapters give you a good
theoretical overview and enough practical information to get by, and
later chapters fill in the nitty-gritty details. We provide a roadmap
up front to suggest a path through the book appropriate for your job
or interest.</p><p>


When we talk about actual DNS software, we'll concentrate
almost exclusively on BIND, the Berkeley Internet Name Domain
software, which is the most popular implementation of the DNS specs
(and the one we know best). We've tried to distill our
experience in managing and maintaining zones with BIND into this
book. (One of our zones, incidentally, was once one of the largest on
the Internet, but that was a long time ago.) Where possible,
we've included the real programs we use in administration, many
of them rewritten into Perl for speed and efficiency.</p><p>


We hope this book will help you get acquainted with DNS and BIND if
you're just starting out, refine your understanding if
you're already familiar with them, and provide valuable insight
and experience even if you know 'em like the back of your hand.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-PREF-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Versions</h2>


<a name="INDEX-3" />The
fourth edition of this book deals with the new 9.1.0 and 8.2.3
versions of BIND as well as the older 4.9 versions. While 9.1.0 and
8.2.3 are the most recent versions as of this writing, they
haven't made their way into many vendors' versions of
Unix yet, partly because both versions have only recently been
released and many vendors are wary of using such new software. We
also occasionally mention other versions of BIND, especially 4.8.3,
because many vendors continue to ship code based on this older
software as part of their Unix products. Whenever a feature is
available only in the 4.9, 8.2.3, or 9.1.0 version, or when there is
a difference in the behavior of the versions, we try to point out
which version does what.</p><p>


We use <a name="INDEX-4" /><em class="emphasis">nslookup</em>, a name
server utility program, very frequently in our examples. The version
we use is the one shipped with the 8.2.3 BIND code. Older versions of
<em class="emphasis">nslookup</em> provide much, but not quite all, of the
functionality in the 8.2.3 <em class="emphasis">nslookup</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a> We've used commands common to most
<em class="emphasis">nslookup</em> sin most of our
examples; when this was not possible, we tried to note it.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-2" />[2]This is also true of the version of <em class="filename">nslookup
</em>shipped with BIND 9. See <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "nslookup and dig"</a>, for
details.</p><p>
