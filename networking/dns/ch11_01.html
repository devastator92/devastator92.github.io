<a name="INDEX-1804" /></a><a name="INDEX-1805" /></a>Why should you care about DNS security? Why go to the trouble of securing a service that mostly maps names to addresses? Let us tell you a story.</p><p>


In July 1997, during two periods of several days, users around the
Internet who typed <em class="emphasis">www.internic.net</em> into their web browsers thinking they were going to the InterNIC's web site instead
ended up at a web site belonging to the AlterNIC. (The AlterNIC runs
an alternate set of root name servers that delegate to additional
top-level domains with names like <em class="emphasis">med</em> and <em class="emphasis">porn</em>.)
How'd it happen? Eugene Kashpureff, then affiliated with the
AlterNIC, had run a program to "poison" the caches of
major name servers around the world, making them believe that
<em class="emphasis">www.internic.net</em>'s address
was actually the address of the AlterNIC web server.</p><p>


Kashpureff hadn't made any attempt to disguise what he had
done; the web site that users reached was plainly the
AlterNIC's, not the InterNIC's. But imagine someone
poisoning your name server's cache to direct <em class="emphasis">www.amazon.com</em> or <em class="emphasis">www.wellsfargo.com</em> to his own web server,
conveniently well outside local law enforcement jurisdiction.
Further, imagine your users typing in their credit card numbers and
expiration dates. Now you get the idea.</p><p>


Protecting your users against these kinds of attacks requires DNS
security. DNS security comes in several flavors. You can secure
transactions -- the queries, responses, and other messages your
name server sends and receives. You can secure your name server,
refusing queries, zone transfer requests, and dynamic updates from
unauthorized addresses, for example. You can even secure zone data by
digitally signing it.</p><p>


Since DNS security is one of the most complicated topics in DNS,
we'll start you off easy and build up to the hard stuff.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-CHP-11-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">11.1. TSIG</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1806" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1807" /></a>BIND 8.2 introduced a
new mechanism for securing DNS messages called <em class="emphasis">transaction
signatures</em>, or TSIG for short. TSIG uses shared secrets
and a one-way hash function to authenticate DNS messages,
particularly responses and updates.</p><p>


TSIG, now codified in <a name="INDEX-1808" /></a>RFC 2845, is relatively simple to
configure, lightweight for resolvers and name servers to use, and
flexible enough to secure DNS messages (including zone transfers) and
dynamic updates. (Contrast this with the DNS Security Extensions,
which we'll discuss at the end of this chapter.)</p><p>


With TSIG configured, a name server or updater adds a TSIG record to
the additional data section of a DNS message. The TSIG record
"signs" the DNS message, proving that the message's
sender had a cryptographic key shared with the receiver and that the
message wasn't modified after it left the sender.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-81">[81]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-81" /></a>[81]Cryptography wonks may argue that TSIG "signatures"
aren't really signatures in a cryptographic sense because they
don't provide nonrepudiation. Since either holder of the shared
key can create a signed message, the recipient of a signed message
can't claim that only the sender could have sent it (the
recipient could have forged it himself).</p><p>

</blockquote>


<a name="dns4-CHP-11-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.1. One-Way Hash Functions</h3>


TSIG provides authentication and data integrity through the use of a
special type of mathematical formula called a <em class="emphasis">one-way hash
function</em><a name="INDEX-1809" /></a>. A one-way
hash function, also known as a <a name="INDEX-1810" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1811" /></a>cryptographic checksum or message
digest, computes a fixed-size hash value based on arbitrarily large
input. The magic of a one-way hash function is that each bit of the
hash value depends on each and every bit of the input. Change a
single bit of the input and the hash value changes dramatically and
unpredictably -- so unpredictably that it's
"computationally infeasible" to reverse the function and
find an input that produces a given hash value.</p><p>


TSIG uses a one-way hash function called MD5. In particular, it uses
a variant of <a name="INDEX-1812" /></a>MD5 called
HMAC-MD5. HMAC-MD5 works in a keyed mode in which the 128-bit hash
value depends not only on the input, but also on a key.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-11-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.2. The TSIG Record</h3>


We won't cover the <a name="INDEX-1813" /></a>TSIG record's syntax in detail
because you don't need to know it: TSIG is a
"meta-record" that never appears in zone data and is
never cached by a resolver or name server. A signer adds the TSIG
record to a DNS message, and the recipient removes and verifies the
record before doing anything further, such as caching the data in the
message.</p><p>


You should know, however, that the TSIG record includes a hash value
computed over the entire DNS message as well as some additional
fields. (When we say "computed over," we mean that the
raw, binary DNS message and the additional fields are fed through the
HMAC-MD5 algorithm to produce the hash value.) The hash value is
keyed with a secret shared between the signer and the verifier.
Verifying the hash value proves both that the DNS message was signed
by a holder of the shared secret and that it wasn't modified
after it was signed.</p><p>


The additional fields in the TSIG record include the time the DNS
message was signed. This helps combat replay attacks, in which a
hacker captures a signed, authorized transaction (say a dynamic
update deleting an important resource record) and replays it later.
The recipient of a signed DNS message checks the time signed to make
sure it's within the allowable "fudge" (another
field in the TSIG record).</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-11-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.3. Configuring TSIG</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1814" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1815" /></a>Before
using TSIG for authentication, we need to configure one or more TSIG
keys on either end of the transaction. For example, if we want to use
TSIG to secure zone transfers between the master and slave name
servers for <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>, we
need to configure both name servers with a common key:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">key terminator-wormhole.movie.edu. {
	algorithm hmac-md5;
	secret "skrKc4Twy/cIgIykQu7JZA==";
};</pre></blockquote>


The argument to the <em class="emphasis">key</em> statement in this
example, <em class="emphasis">terminator-wormhole.movie.edu</em>, is
actually the name of the key, though it looks like a domain name.
(It's encoded in the DNS message in the same format as a domain
name.) The TSIG RFC suggests you name the key after the two hosts
that use it. The RFC also suggests that you use different keys for
each pair of hosts.</p><p>


It's important that the name of the key -- not just the
binary data the key points to -- be identical on both ends of the
transaction. If it's not, the recipient tries to verify the
TSIG record and finds it doesn't know the key that the TSIG
record says was used to compute the hash value. That causes errors
like the following:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Nov 21 19:43:00 wormhole named-xfer[30326]: SOA TSIG verification from server 
[192.249.249.1], zone movie.edu: message had BADKEY set (17)</pre></blockquote>


The algorithm, for now, is always <em class="emphasis">hmac-md5</em>. The
secret is the base 64 encoding of the binary key. You can create a
base 64-encoded key using the <em class="filename">dnssec-keygen
</em>program included in BIND 9 or the
<em class="filename">dnskeygen</em> program included in BIND 8.
Here's how you'd create a key using
<em class="filename">dnssec-keygen</em>, the easier of the two to use:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 128 -n HOST terminator-wormhole.movie.edu.</b></tt>
Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446</pre></blockquote>


The <span class="option">-a</span> option takes as an argument the name of the
algorithm the key will be used with. (That's necessary because
<em class="filename">dnssec-keygen </em>can generate other kinds of keys,
as we'll see in the DNSSEC section.) <span class="option">-b</span> takes
the length of the key as its argument; the RFC recommends using keys
128 bits long. <span class="option">-n</span> takes as an argument HOST, the
type of key to generate. (DNSSEC uses ZONE keys.) The final argument
is the name of the key.</p><p>


<em class="filename">dnssec-keygen </em>and <em class="filename">dnskeygen
</em>both create files in their working directories that
contain the keys generated. <em class="filename">dnssec-keygen </em>prints
the base name of the files to its standard output. In this case,
<em class="filename">dnssec-keygen</em> created the files
<em class="filename">Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446.key
</em>and<em class="filename">
Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446.private</em>. You can
extract the key from either file. The funny numbers (157 and 28446),
in case you're wondering, are the key's DNSSEC algorithm
number (157 is HMAC-MD5) and the key's fingerprint (28446), a
hash value computed over the key to identify it. The fingerprint
isn't particularly useful in TSIG, but DNSSEC supports multiple
keys per zone, so identifying which key you mean by its fingerprint
is important.</p><p>


<em class="filename">Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446.key
</em>contains:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">terminator-wormhole.movie.edu. IN KEY 512 3 157 skrKc4Twy/cIgIykQu7JZA==</pre></blockquote>


and<em class="filename"> Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446.private
</em>contains:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Private-key-format: v1.2
Algorithm: 157 (HMAC_MD5)
Key: skrKc4Twy/cIgIykQu7JZA==</pre></blockquote>


You can also choose your own key and encode it in base 64 using
<em class="filename">mmencode</em> :</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>mmencode</b></tt><i class="lineannotation">
foobarbaz</i>
Zm9vYmFyYmF6</pre></blockquote>


Since the actual binary key is, as the substatement implies, a
secret, we should take care in transferring it to our name servers
(e.g., by using <em class="filename">ssh</em>) and make sure that not just
anyone can read it. We can do that by making sure our
<em class="filename">named.conf </em>file isn't world-readable or by
using the <em class="emphasis">include</em> statement to read the
<em class="emphasis">key</em> statement from another file, which
isn't world-readable:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">include "/etc/dns.keys.conf";</pre></blockquote>


There's one last problem that we see cropping up frequently
with TSIG: <a name="INDEX-1816" /></a>time synchronization. The timestamp in the
TSIG record is useful for preventing replay attacks, but it tripped
us up initially because the clocks on our name servers weren't
synchronized. That produced error messages like the following:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Nov 21 19:56:36 wormhole named-xfer[30420]: SOA TSIG verification from server 
[192.249.249.1], zone movie.edu: BADTIME (-18)</pre></blockquote>


We quickly remedied the problem using <a name="INDEX-1817" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1818" /></a>NTP, the network time protocol.<a name="INDEX-1819" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1820" /></a><a href="#FOOTNOTE-82">[82]</a><p></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-82" /></a>[82]See the Time Synchronization Server web site at <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp</a> for information on NTP.</p><p>

</blockquote>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-11-SECT-1.4" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.4. Using TSIG</h3>


<a name="INDEX-1821" /></a>Now that
we've gone to the trouble of configuring our name servers with
TSIG keys, we should probably configure them to use those keys for
something. In BIND 8.2 and later name servers, we can secure queries,
responses, zone transfers, and dynamic updates with TSIG.</p><p>


The key to configuring this is the <em class="emphasis">server</em>
statement's <em class="emphasis">keys</em><a name="INDEX-1822" /></a> substatement, which tells a name
server to sign queries and zone transfer requests sent to a
particular remote name server. This <em class="emphasis">server
</em>substatement, for example, tells the local name server,
<em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, to sign
all such requests sent to 192.249.249.1 (<em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em>) with the key <em class="emphasis">terminator-wormhole.movie.edu</em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">server 192.249.249.1 {
	keys { terminator-wormhole.movie.edu.; };
};</pre></blockquote>


Now, on <em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em>, we can restrict zone transfers to those signed with the <em class="emphasis">terminator-wormhole.movie.edu</em> key:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">zone "movie.edu" {
	type master;
	file "db.movie.edu";
	allow-transfer { key terminator-wormhole.movie.edu.; };
};</pre></blockquote>


<em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em> also signs the zone transfer, which allows <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> to verify it.</p><p>


You can also restrict <a name="INDEX-1823" /></a>dynamic updates with TSIG by using the
<em class="emphasis">allow-update</em> <a name="INDEX-1824" /></a>and
<em class="emphasis">update-policy</em> <a name="INDEX-1825" /></a>substatements, as we showed you in the
last chapter.</p><p>


The <em class="filename">nsupdate</em><a name="INDEX-1826" /></a> programs shipped with BIND 8.2 and later
support sending TSIG-signed dynamic updates. If you have the key
files created by <em class="filename">dnssec-keygen</em> lying around, you
can specify either of those as an argument to
<em class="filename">nsupdate</em>'s <span class="option">-k</span> option.
Here's how you'd do that with BIND 9's version of
<em class="filename">nsupdate </em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nsupdate -k Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446.key</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


or:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nsupdate -k Kterminator-wormhole.movie.edu.+157+28446.private</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


With the BIND 8.2 or later <em class="filename">nsupdate</em>, the syntax
is a little different: <span class="option">-k</span> takes a directory and a
key name as an argument, separated by a colon:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nsupdate -k /var/named:terminator-wormhole.movie.edu</b></tt>.</pre></blockquote>


If you don't have the files around (maybe you're running
<em class="filename">nsupdate</em> from another host), you can still
specify the key name and the secret on the command line with the BIND
9 <em class="filename">nsupdate </em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nsupdate -y terminator-wormhole.movie.edu.:skrKc4Twy/cIgIykQu7JZA==</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


The name of the key is the first argument to the <span class="option">-y</span>
option, followed by a colon and the base 64-encoded secret. You
don't need to quote the secret since base 64 values can't
contain shell metacharacters, but you can if you like.</p><p>


Michael <a name="INDEX-1827" /></a>Fuhr's
<a name="INDEX-1828" /></a>Net::DNS Perl module also lets you send
TSIG-signed dynamic updates and zone transfer requests. For more
information on <a name="INDEX-1829" /></a>Net::DNS,
see <a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "Programming with the Resolver and Name Server Library Routines"</a>.</p><p>


Now that we've got a handy mechanism for securing DNS
transactions, let's talk about securing our whole name
server.<a name="INDEX-1830" /></a></p><p>
