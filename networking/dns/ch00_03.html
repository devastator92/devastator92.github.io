<h2 class="sect1">0.3. Organization</h2>


This book is organized to more or less follow the evolution of a zone
and its administrator. <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "Background"</a> and <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "How Does DNS Work?"</a> discuss
Domain Name System theory. <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Where Do I Start?"</a>
through <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring Hosts"</a> help you decide whether or not
to set up your own zones, then describe how to go about it should you
choose to. The middle of the book, <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Maintaining BIND"</a> through <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Security"</a>, describe
how to maintain your zones, configure hosts to use your name servers,
plan for the growth of your zones, create subdomains, and secure your
name servers. Finally, <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "nslookup and dig"</a> through
<a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Miscellaneous"</a> deal with troubleshooting tools, common
problems, and the lost art of programming with the resolver library
routines.</p><p>


Here's a more detailed, chapter-by-chapter breakdown:</p><p>


<a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "Background"</a>, provides a little historical
perspective and discusses the problems that motivated the development
of DNS, and then presents an overview of DNS theory.</p><p>


<a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "How Does DNS Work?"</a>, goes over DNS theory in more detail,
including the organization of the DNS namespace, domains, zones, and
name servers. We also introduce important concepts like name
resolution and caching.</p><p>


<a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Where Do I Start?"</a>, covers how to get the BIND software if
you don't already have it, what to do with it once you've
got it, how to figure out what your domain name should be, and how to
contact the organization that can delegate your zone to you.</p><p>


<a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Setting Up BIND"</a>, details how to set up your first two
BIND name servers, including creating your name server database,
starting up your name servers, and checking their operation.</p><p>


<a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "DNS and Electronic Mail"</a>, deals with DNS's MX record, which
allows administrators to specify alternate hosts to handle a given
destination's mail. This chapter covers mail routing strategies
for a wide variety of networks and hosts, including networks with
Internet firewalls and hosts without direct Internet connectivity.</p><p>


<a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring Hosts"</a>, explains how to configure a BIND
resolver. We also include notes on the idiosyncrasies of many major
Unix vendors' resolver implementations, as well as the Windows
95, NT, and 2000 resolvers.</p><p>


<a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Maintaining BIND"</a>, describes the periodic maintenance that
administrators need to perform to keep their zones running smoothly,
such as checking name server health and authority.</p><p>


<a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Growing Your Domain"</a>, covers how to plan for the growth and
evolution of your zones, including how to get big and how to plan for
moves and outages.</p><p>


<a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Parenting"</a>, explores the joys of becoming a parent
zone. We explain when to become a parent (create subdomains), what to
call your children, how to create them (!), and how to watch over
them.</p><p>


<a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>, goes over some less-often-used name
server configuration options that can help you tune your name
server's operation and ease administration.</p><p>


<a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Security"</a><em class="emphasis">,</em> describes how to
secure your name server and how to configure your name servers to
deal with Internet firewalls, and also describes two new security
enhancements to DNS: the DNS Security Extensions and Transaction
Signatures.</p><p>


<a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "nslookup and dig"</a>, shows the ins and outs of the most
popular tools for doing DNS debugging, including techniques for
digging obscure information out of remote name servers.</p><p>


<a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13, "Reading BIND Debugging Output"</a>, is the Rosetta Stone of BIND's
debugging information. This chapter will help you make sense of the
cryptic debugging information that BIND emits, which in turn will
help you understand your name server better.</p><p>


<a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Troubleshooting DNS and BIND"</a>, covers many common DNS and BIND
problems and their solutions, and describes a number of less common,
harder-to- diagnose scenarios.</p><p>


<a href="ch15_01.html">Chapter 15, "Programming with the Resolver and Name Server Library Routines"</a>, demonstrates how to use BIND's
resolver routines to query name servers and retrieve data from within
a C program or a Perl script. We include a useful (we hope!) program
to check the health and authority of your name servers.</p><p>


<a href="ch16_01.html">Chapter 16, "Miscellaneous"</a>, ties up all the loose ends. We cover
DNS wildcards, hosts and networks with intermittent Internet
connectivity via dialup, network name encoding, experimental record
types, and Windows 2000.</p><p>


<a href="appa_01.html">Appendix A, "DNS Message Format and Resource Records"</a>, contains a byte-by-byte breakdown of
the formats used in DNS queries and responses, as well as a
comprehensive list of the currently defined resource record types.</p><p>


<a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B, "BIND Compatibility Matrix"</a>, contains a matrix showing the most
important features of the most popular BIND releases.</p><p>


<a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "Compiling and Installing BIND on Linux"</a>, contains step-by-step instructions on
how to compile the 8.2.3 version of BIND on Linux.</p><p>


<a href="appd_01.html">Appendix D, "Top-Level Domains"</a>, lists the current top-level domains in
the Internet's domain name space.</p><p>


<a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "BIND Name Server and Resolver Configuration"</a>, summarizes the syntax and semantics of
each of the parameters available for configuring name servers and
resolvers.</p><p>
