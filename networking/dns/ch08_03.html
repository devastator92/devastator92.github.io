<h2 class="sect1">8.3. Registering Name Servers</h2>


<a name="INDEX-1360" />
<a name="INDEX-1361" />When you get around to setting up more
and more name servers, a question may strike you -- do I need to
register <em class="emphasis">all</em> of my primary master and slave name
servers with my parent zone? No, only those servers you want to make
available to name servers outside your zone need to be registered
with your parent. For example, if you run nine name servers for your
zone, you may choose to tell the parent zone about only four of them.
Within your network, you use all nine servers. Five of those nine
servers, however, are queried only by resolvers on hosts that are
configured to query them (in <em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>, for
example). Their parent zone's name servers don't delegate
to them, so they'll never be queried by remote name servers.
Only the four servers registered with your parent zone are queried by
other name servers, including caching-only and partial-slave name
servers on your network. This setup is shown in <a href="ch08_03.html#dns4-CHP-8-FIG-2">Figure 8-2</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-8-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="334" alt="Figure 8-2" src="figs/dns4_0802.gif" width="436" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-2. Registering only some of your name servers</h4>

Besides being able to pick and choose which of your name servers are
hammered by outside queries, there's a technical motivation for
registering only some of your zone's name servers:
there's a limit to how many servers will fit in a
<a name="INDEX-1362" />UDP
response message. In practice, around 10 name server records should
fit. Depending on the data (how many servers are in the same domain),
you could get more or fewer.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-63">[63]</a>
There's not much point in registering more than 10 name
servers, anyway -- if none of the 10 servers can be reached,
it's unlikely the destination host can be reached.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-63" />[63]The<sup class="superscript">
</sup>domain names of the Internet's root name servers
were changed because of this. All of the roots were moved into the
same domain, <em class="filename">root-servers.net</em>, to take the most
advantage of domain name compression and store information about as
many roots as possible in a single UDP packet.</p><p>

</blockquote>


<a name="INDEX-1363" /> <a name="INDEX-1364" />If you set up a new
authoritative name server and decide it should be registered, make a
list of the parents of the zones it's authoritative for.
You'll need to contact the administrators for each of these
parent zones. For example, let's say we want to register the
name server we just set up on <em class="emphasis">zardoz.movie.edu</em>. In order to get this
slave registered in all the right zones, we'll need to contact
the administrators of <em class="emphasis">edu</em>and <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>. (For help determining who
runs your parent zones, turn back to <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Where Do I Start?"</a> )</p><p>


When you contact the administrators of a parent zone, be sure to
follow the process they specify (if any) on their web site. If
there's no standard modification process, you'll have to
send them the domain name of the zone (or zones) that the new name
server is authoritative for. If the new name server is in the new
zone, you'll also need to give them the IP address(es) of the
new name server. In fact, if there's no official format for
submitting the information, it's often best just to send your
parent the complete list of registered name servers for the zone,
plus any addresses necessary, in zone data file format. That avoids
any potential confusion.</p><p>


Since our networks were originally assigned by the InterNIC, we used
the web-based process at <a href="http://www.arin.net/cgi-bin/amt.pl">http://www.arin.net/cgi-bin/amt.pl</a> to change
our registration. (If we'd preferred to do things manually, we
could have sent them the form at <a href="http://www.arin.net/regserv/templates/modifytemplate.txt">http://www.arin.net/regserv/templates/modifytemplate.txt</a>.)
If they hadn't had a template for us to use, our message to the
administrator of <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> might have read something
like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Howdy!

I've just set up a new slave name server on
zardoz.movie.edu for the 249.249.192.in-addr.arpa
and 253.253.192.in-addr.arpa zones.  Would you
please add NS records for this name server to the
in-addr.arpa zone?  That would make our delegation
information look like:

253.253.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS terminator.movie.edu.
253.253.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS wormhole.movie.edu.
253.253.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS zardoz.movie.edu.

249.249.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS terminator.movie.edu.
249.249.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS wormhole.movie.edu.
249.249.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS zardoz.movie.edu.

Thanks!

Notice that we specified explicit TTLs on the NS and A records?
That's because our parent name servers aren't
authoritative for those records; <em class="emphasis">our</em> name
servers are. By including them, we're indicating our choice of
a TTL for our zone's delegation. Of course, our parent may have
other ideas about what the TTL should be.</p><p>


In this case, glue data -- A records for each of the name
servers -- isn't necessary, since the domain names of the
name servers aren't within the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones. They're within
<em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>, so a name server
that was referred to <em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em> or <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> could still find
their addresses by following delegation to the <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> name servers.</p><p>


Is a <a name="INDEX-1365" />partial-slave name server a good name
server to register with your parent zone? Actually, it's not
ideal, because it's only authoritative for some of your
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones.
Administratively, it may be easier to register only servers that back
up <em class="emphasis">all</em> the local zones; that way, you
don't need to keep track of which name servers are
authoritative for which zones. All of your parent zones can delegate
to the same set of name servers: your primary master and your
"full" slaves.</p><p>


However, if you don't have many name servers or if you're
good at remembering which name servers are authoritative for what, go
ahead and register a partial-slave.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1366" />Caching-only name servers, on the other
hand, must <em class="emphasis">never</em> be registered. A caching-only
name server rarely has complete information for any given zone, just
the bits and pieces of it that it has looked up recently. If a parent
zone's name server were mistakenly to refer a foreign name
server to a caching-only name server, the foreign name server would
send the caching-only name server a nonrecursive query. The
caching-only name server might have the data cached, but then again,
it might not. If it didn't have the data, it would refer the
querier to the best name servers it knew (those closest to the domain
name in the query) -- which might include the caching-only name
server itself! The poor foreign name server might never get an
answer. This kind of misconfiguration -- actually, delegating a
zone to any name server not authoritative for that zone -- is
known <a name="INDEX-1367" />
<a name="INDEX-1368" />as <a name="INDEX-1369" /><em class="firstterm">lame
delegation</em>.<a name="INDEX-1370" /> <a name="INDEX-1371" /></p><p>
