<em>"It seems very pretty," she said when she had finished
it, "but it's rather hard to understand!" (You see
she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she
couldn't make it out at all.) "Somehow it seems to fill
my head with ideas -- only I don't exactly know what they
are!"</em></p><p>


<a name="INDEX-388" /></a>If you
have been diligently reading each chapter of this book, you're
probably anxious to get a name server running. This chapter is for
you. Let's set up a couple of name servers. Others of you may
have read the table of contents and skipped directly to this chapter.
(Shame on you!) If you are one of those people, be aware that we may
use concepts from earlier chapters and expect you to understand them
already.</p><p>


There are several factors that influence how you should set up your
name servers. The biggest is what sort of access you have to the
<a name="INDEX-389" /></a>Internet: complete access (e.g., you can
FTP to ftp.uu.net), limited
access (restricted by a security firewall), or no access at all. This
chapter assumes you have complete access. We'll discuss the
other cases in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Security"</a>.</p><p>


In this chapter, we set up two name servers for a few fictitious
zones as an example for you to follow in setting up your own zones.
We cover the topics in this chapter in enough detail to get your
first two name servers running. Subsequent chapters fill in the holes
and go into greater depth. If you already have your name servers
running, skim through this chapter to familiarize yourself with the
terms we use or just to verify that you didn't miss something
when you set up your servers.</p><p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">4.1. Our Zone</h2>


<a name="INDEX-390" /></a>Our fictitious zone serves a college. Movie
University studies all aspects of the film industry and researches
novel ways to distribute films. One of our most promising projects
involves research into using IP as a film distribution medium. After
visiting our registrar's web site, we have decided on the
domain name <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>. A
recent grant has enabled us to connect to the Internet.</p><p>


Movie U. currently has two Ethernets, and we have plans to add
another network or two. The Ethernets have network numbers
192.249.249/24 and 192.253.253/24. A portion of our host table
contains the following entries:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">127.0.0.1      localhost

# These are our killer machines

192.249.249.2  robocop.movie.edu robocop
192.249.249.3  terminator.movie.edu terminator bigt
192.249.249.4  diehard.movie.edu diehard dh

# These machines are in horror(ible) shape and will be replaced
# soon.

192.253.253.2  misery.movie.edu misery
192.253.253.3  shining.movie.edu shining
192.253.253.4  carrie.movie.edu carrie

# A wormhole is a fictitious phenomenon that instantly transports
# space travelers over long distances and is not known to be
# stable.  The only difference between wormholes and routers is
# that routers don't transport packets as instantly--especially
# ours.
