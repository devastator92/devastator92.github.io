<h2 class="sect1">12.7. Troubleshooting nslookup Problems</h2>


<a name="INDEX-2042" />
<a name="INDEX-2043" /><a name="INDEX-2044" />The last
thing you want is to have problems with your troubleshooting tool.
Unfortunately, some types of failures render
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> nearly useless. Other types of
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> failures are (at best) confusing,
because they don't give you any clear information to work with.
While there may be a few problems with <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
itself, most of the problems you encounter will be caused by name
server configuration and operation. We'll cover these problems
here.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.1. Looking Up the Right Data</h3>


This isn't really a problem per se, but it can be awfully
confusing. If you use <em class="filename">nslookup</em> to look up a type
of record for a domain name, and the domain name exists but records
of the type you're looking for don't, you'll get an
error like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  0.0.0.0

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>movie.edu.</b></tt>

*** No address (A) records available for movie.edu.</pre></blockquote>


So what types of records do exist? Just <em class="emphasis">set
type=any</em> to find out:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>set type=any</b></tt>
&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>movie.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  0.0.0.0

movie.edu
      origin = terminator.movie.edu
      mail addr = al.robocop.movie.edu
      serial = 42
      refresh = 10800 (3H)
      retry   = 3600 (1H)
      expire  = 604800 (7D)
      minimum ttl = 86400 (1D)
movie.edu    nameserver = terminator.movie.edu
movie.edu    nameserver = wormhole.movie.edu
movie.edu    nameserver = zardoz.movie.edu
movie.edu    preference = 10, mail exchanger = postmanrings2x.movie.edu
postmanrings2x.movie.edu        internet address = 192.249.249.66</pre></blockquote>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.2. No Response from Server</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2045" />What could have gone wrong if
your name server can't look up its own name?</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  0.0.0.0

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>terminator</b></tt>
Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  0.0.0.0

*** terminator.movie.edu can't find terminator: No response from server</pre></blockquote>


The<a name="INDEX-2046" /> "no response from server"
error message means exactly that: the resolver didn't get back
a response. <em class="filename">nslookup</em> doesn't necessarily
look up anything when it starts up. If you see that the address of
your name server is 0.0.0.0, then <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
grabbed the system's host name (what the
<em class="filename">hostname</em> command returns) for the
<em class="emphasis">Default Server</em> field and gave you its prompt.
It's only when you try to look something up that you find out
there is no name server responding. In this case, it's pretty
obvious that there's no server running -- a name server
ought to be able to look up its own name. If you are looking up some
remote information, though, the name server could fail to respond
because it's still trying to look up the data and
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> gave up waiting. How can you tell the
difference between a name server that isn't running and a name
server that is running but didn't respond? You can use the
<em class="emphasis">ls</em> command to figure it out:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  0.0.0.0

<i class="lineannotation">&gt; </i><tt class="userinput"><b>ls foo.</b></tt>   <i class="lineannotation">  -- Try to list a nonexistent zone</i>
*** Can't list domain foo.: No response from server</pre></blockquote>


In this case, no name server is running. If the host couldn't
be reached, the error would be "timed out." If a name
server is running, you'll see the following error message:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  0.0.0.0

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>ls foo.</b></tt>
[terminator.movie.edu]
*** Can't list domain foo.: No information</pre></blockquote>


That is, unless there's a top-level <em class="emphasis">foo</em> zone in your world.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.3. No PTR Record for Name Server's Address</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2047" /><a name="INDEX-2048" />Here's one of
<em class="filename">nslookup</em>'s most
annoying problems: something went wrong, and
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> exited on startup:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>

*** Can't find server name for address 192.249.249.3: Non-existent host/domain
*** Default servers are not available</pre></blockquote>


The<a name="INDEX-2049" /><a name="INDEX-2050" /> "nonexistent
domain" message means that the name <em class="emphasis">3.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa</em> doesn't
exist. In other words, <em class="filename">nslookup</em> couldn't
map 192.249.249.3, the address of its name server, to a domain name.
But didn't we just say that <em class="filename">nslookup
</em>doesn't look up anything when it starts up? In the
configuration we showed you before, <em class="filename">nslookup
</em>didn't look up anything, but that's not a
rule. If you create a <em class="filename">resolv.conf</em> that includes
one or more <em class="emphasis">nameserver</em> directives,
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> tries to reverse map the address to get
the name server's domain name. In the preceding example, there
<em class="emphasis">is</em> a name server running on 192.249.249.3, but
it said there are no PTR records for the address 192.249.249.3.
Obviously, the reverse-mapping zone is messed up, at least for the
domain name <em class="emphasis">3.49.249.192.in-addr.arpa</em>.</p><p>


The "default servers are not available" message in the
example is misleading. After all, there is a name server there to say
the address doesn't exist. More often, you'll see the
error "no response from server" if the name server
isn't running on the host or the host can't be reached.
Only then does the "default servers are not available"
message make sense.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.4. Query Refused</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2051" /><a name="INDEX-2052" />Refused queries can cause problems at
startup, and they can cause lookup failures during a session.
Here's what it looks like when <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
exits on startup because of a refused query:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
*** Can't find server name for address 192.249.249.3: Query refused
*** Default servers are not available
%</pre></blockquote>


This one has two possible causes. Either your name server does not
support inverse queries (older <em class="filename">nslookup </em>s only)
or an access list is preventing the lookup.</p><p>


Old versions of <em class="filename">nslookup</em> (pre-4.8.3) used
an<a name="INDEX-2053" /><a name="INDEX-2054" />
inverse query on startup. Inverse queries were never widely
used -- <em class="filename">nslookup</em> was one of the few
applications that did use them. In BIND 4.9, support for inverse
queries was dropped, which broke old <em class="filename">nslookup </em>s.
To accommodate these old clients, a new configuration file option was
added.</p><p>


In BIND 4, the directive looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options fake-iquery</pre></blockquote>


In BIND 8, the statement looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options { fake-iquery yes; };</pre></blockquote>


(BIND 9 doesn't support <em class="emphasis">fake-iquery</em> as of
9.1.0.)</p><p>


This causes your name server to respond to the inverse query with a
"fake" response that is good enough to let
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> continue.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-97">[97]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-97" />[97]The fake
response to an inverse query for, say, the domain name that owns the
address 192.249.249.3 is just the address in square brackets,
[192.249.249.3].</p><p>

</blockquote>


<a name="INDEX-2055" /><a name="INDEX-2056" />Access lists can also
cause <em class="filename">nslookup</em> startup problems. When
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> attempts to find the domain name of its
name server (using a PTR query, not an inverse query), the query can
be refused. If you think the problem is an access list, make sure you
allow the host you're running on to query the name server.
Check any <em class="emphasis">secure_zone</em> TXT
records or <em class="emphasis">allow-query</em> substatements for the IP
address of the local host or the loopback address, if you're
running <em class="filename">nslookup</em> on the same host as the name
server.</p><p>


Access lists can do more than cause <em class="filename">nslookup</em> to
fail to start up. They can also cause lookups and zone transfers to
fail in the middle of a session when you point
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> at a remote name server. This is what
you would see:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
Default Server:  hp.com
Address:  15.255.152.4

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>server terminator.movie.edu</b></tt>
Default Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  192.249.249.3

&gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>carrie.movie.edu.</b></tt>
Server:  terminator.movie.edu
Address:  192.249.249.3

*** terminator.movie.edu can't find carrie.movie.edu.: Query refused

<i class="lineannotation">&gt; </i><tt class="userinput"><b>ls movie.edu</b></tt>                   --This attempts a zone transfer
[terminator.movie.edu]
*** Can't list domain movie.edu: Query refused
&gt;</pre></blockquote>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.5. First resolv.conf Name Server Not Responding</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2057" />Here is another twist on the last
problem:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup</b></tt>
*** Can't find server name for address 192.249.249.3: No response from server
Default Server:  wormhole.movie.edu
Address:  192.249.249.1</pre></blockquote>


This time, the first name server listed in
<em class="filename">resolv.conf</em> did not respond. We had a second
<em class="emphasis">nameserver</em> directive
in<a name="INDEX-2058" /> <em class="filename">resolv.conf</em>, though,
and the second server did respond. From now on,
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> will send queries only to <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>; it won't try
the name server at 192.249.249.3 again.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.6. Finding Out What Is Being Looked Up</h3>


<a name="INDEX-2059" />We've been waving our
hands in the last examples, claiming that
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> was looking up the name server's
address, but we didn't prove it. Here is our proof. This time,
when we started up <em class="filename">nslookup</em>, we turned on
<em class="emphasis">d2</em> debugging from the command line. This causes
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> to print out the query messages it
sent, as well as printing out when the query timed out and was
retransmitted:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>nslookup -d2</b></tt>
------------
SendRequest(  ), len 44
    HEADER:
        opcode = QUERY, id = 1, rcode = NOERROR
        header flags:  query, want recursion
        questions = 1,  answers = 0,  authority records = 0,
        additional = 0

    QUESTIONS:
        3.249.249.192.in-addr.arpa, type = PTR, class = IN

------------
timeout (5 secs)
timeout (10 secs)
timeout (20 secs)
timeout (40 secs)
SendRequest failed

*** Can't find server name for address 192.249.249.3: No response from server
*** Default servers are not available</pre></blockquote>


As you can see by the timeouts, it took 75 seconds for
<em class="filename">nslookup</em> to give up. Without the debugging
output, you wouldn't have seen anything printed to the screen
for 75 seconds; it'd look as if <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
had hung.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-12-SECT-7.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.7. Unspecified Error</h3>


You can run into a rather unsettling problem called
an<a name="INDEX-2060" /><a name="INDEX-2061" /> "unspecified error."
We have an example of this error here. We've included only the
tail end of the output, since we just want to talk about the error at
this point (you'll find the whole <em class="filename">nslookup</em>
session that produced this segment in <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Troubleshooting DNS and BIND"</a>):</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Authoritative answers can be found from:
(root)  nameserver = NS.NIC.DDN.MIL
(root)  nameserver = B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
(root)  nameserver = E.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
(root)  nameserver = D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
(root)  nameserver = F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
(root)  nameserver = C.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
(root)  nameserver =
*** Error: record size incorrect (1050690 != 65519)

*** relay.hp.com can't find .: Unspecified error</pre></blockquote>


<a name="INDEX-2062" />What
happened here is that there was too much data to fit into a UDP
datagram. The name server stopped filling in the response when it ran
out of room. The name server didn't set the truncation bit in
the response packet, or <em class="filename">nslookup</em> would have
retried the query over a TCP connection; the name server must have
decided that enough of the "important" information fit.
You won't see this kind of error very often. You'll see
it if you create too many NS records for a zone, so don't
create too many. (Advice like this makes you wonder why you bought
this book, right?) How many is "too many" depends on how
well the domain names in the packet can be "compressed,"
which, in turn, depends on how many name servers' names end in
the same domain name. The root name servers were renamed to end in
<em class="emphasis">root-servers.net</em> for this
very reason -- this allows more root name servers (13) on the
Internet. As a rule of thumb, don't go over 10 NS records. As
for what caused <em class="emphasis">this</em> error, you'll just
have to read <a href="ch14_01.html">Chapter 14, "Troubleshooting DNS and BIND"</a>. Those of you who just read
<a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Parenting"</a>, may know already.<a name="INDEX-2063" /> <a name="INDEX-2064" /></p><p>
