<em>The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the
other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at
the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white
kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr -- no doubt
feeling that it was all meant for its good.</em></p><p>


<a name="INDEX-1427" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1428" /></a> <a name="INDEX-1429" /></a>Once your domain
reaches a certain size, or you decide you need to distribute the
management of parts of your domain to various entities within your
organization, you'll want to divide the domain into subdomains.
These subdomains will be the children of your current domain in the
namespace; your domain will be the parent. If you delegate
responsibility for your subdomains to another organization, each
becomes its own zone, separate from its parent zone. We like to call
the management of your subdomains -- your
children -- <em class="emphasis">parenting</em>.</p><p>


Good parenting starts with carving up your domain sensibly, choosing
appropriate names for your subdomains, and delegating the subdomains
to create new zones. A responsible parent also works hard at
maintaining the relationship between his zone and its children; he
ensures that delegation from parent to child is current and correct.</p><p>


Good parenting is vital to the success of your network, especially as
name service becomes critical to navigating between sites. Incorrect
delegation to a child zone's name servers can render a site
effectively unreachable, while the loss of
<a name="INDEX-1430" /></a>connectivity to the parent zone's
name servers can leave a site unable to reach any hosts outside the
local zone.</p><p>


In this chapter we present our views on when to create subdomains,
and we go over how to create and delegate them in some detail. We
also discuss management of the parent-child relationship and,
finally, how to manage the process of carving up a large domain into
smaller subdomains with a minimum of disruption and inconvenience.</p><p>

<a name="INDEX-1431" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1432" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1433" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1434" /></a>Far be it from us to
<em class="emphasis">tell</em> you when you should become a parent, but we
will be so bold as to offer you some guidelines. You may find some
compelling reason to implement subdomains that isn't on our
list, but here are some of the most common reasons:</p><p>


<ul><li>A need to delegate or distribute management of your domain to a
number of organizations<p></p></li><li>The large size of your domain -- dividing it would make it easier
to manage and reduce the load on your authoritative name servers<p></p></li><li>A need to distinguish hosts' organizational affiliation by
including them in particular subdomains<p></p></li></ul>
Once you've decided to have children, the next question to ask
yourself is, naturally, how many children to have.</p><p>
