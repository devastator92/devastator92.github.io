<h2 class="sect1">4.8. Running a Slave Name Server</h2>


<a name="INDEX-604" />You
need to set up another name server for robustness. You can (and
probably will eventually) set up more than two authoritative name
servers for your zones. Two name servers are the minimum -- if you
have only one name server and it goes down, no one can look up domain
names. A second name server splits the load with the first server or
handles the whole load if the first server is down. You
<em class="emphasis">could</em> set up another primary master name server,
but we don't recommend it. Instead, set up a slave name server.
You can always change a slave name server into a primary master name
server later if you decide to expend the extra effort it takes to run
multiple primary master name servers.</p><p>


How does a <a name="INDEX-605" /> <a name="INDEX-606" />server know if
it's the primary master or a slave for a zone? The
<em class="filename">named.conf</em><a name="INDEX-607" /> file tells the name
server whether it is the primary master or a slave on a per-zone
basis. The NS records don't tell us which server is the primary
master for a zone and which servers are slaves -- they only say
who the servers are. (Globally, DNS doesn't care; as far as the
actual name resolution goes, slave servers are as good as primary
master servers.)</p><p>


What's the difference between a primary master name server and
a slave name server? The crucial difference is where the server gets
its data. A primary master name server reads its data from zone data
files. A slave name server loads its data over the network from
another name server. This process is called a
<a name="INDEX-608" /><em class="emphasis">zone transfer</em>.</p><p>


A slave name server is not limited to loading zones from a primary
mastername server; it can also load from
another slave server.</p><p>


The big advantage of slave name servers is that you maintain only one
set of zone data files for a zone, the ones on the primary master
name server. You don't have to worry about synchronizing the
files among name servers; the slaves do that for you. The caveat is
that a slave does not resynchronize instantly -- it polls to see
if its zone data is current. The polling interval is one of those
numbers in the SOA record that we haven't explained yet. (BIND
Versions 8 and 9 support a mechanism to speed up the distribution of
zone data, which we'll describe later.)</p><p>


A slave name server doesn't need to retrieve all its zone data
over the network; the overhead files, <em class="filename">db.cache</em>
and <em class="filename">db.127.0.0</em>, are the same as on a primary
master, so keep a local copy on the slave. That means that a slave
name server is a primary master for <em class="emphasis">0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</em>. Well, you
<em class="emphasis">could</em> make it a slave for <em class="emphasis">0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</em>, but that
zone's data never changes -- it may as well be a primary
master.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-8.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.1. Setup</h3>


<a name="INDEX-609" />
<a name="INDEX-610" />To
set up your slave name server, create a directory for the zone data
files on the slave name server host (e.g., <em class="filename">/var/named
</em>) and copy over the files
<em class="filename">/etc/named.conf</em>, <em class="filename">db.cache</em>,
and <em class="filename">db.127.0.0 </em>:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>rcp /etc/named.conf </b></tt>host:<tt class="userinput"><b>/etc</b></tt>
# <tt class="userinput"><b>rcp db.cache db.127.0.0 </b></tt>host:db-file-directory</pre></blockquote>


You must modify
<em class="filename">/etc/named.conf</em><a name="INDEX-611" /> on the slave name server host. For BIND
4, change every occurrence of <em class="emphasis">primary</em> to
<em class="emphasis">secondary</em> except for the <em class="emphasis">0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</em> zone. Before the
filename on each of these lines, add the IP address of the primary
master server you just set up. For example, if the original BIND 4
configuration file line was this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">primary  movie.edu      db.movie.edu</pre></blockquote>


then the modified line looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">secondary  movie.edu      192.249.249.3 db.movie.edu</pre></blockquote>


If the original BIND 8 or 9 configuration file line was:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">zone "movie.edu" in {
      type master;
      file "db.movie.edu";
};</pre></blockquote>


change <em class="emphasis">master</em> to <em class="emphasis">slave</em> and
add a <em class="emphasis">masters</em> line with the IP address of the
master server:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">zone "movie.edu" in {
      type slave;
      file "bak.movie.edu";
      masters { 192.249.249.3; };
};</pre></blockquote>


This tells the name server that it is a slave for the zone
<em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em> and that it should
track the version of this zone kept on the name server at
192.249.249.3. The slave name server keeps a backup copy of this zone
in the local file <em class="filename">bak.movie.edu</em>.</p><p>


For Movie U., we set up our slave name server on <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>. Recall that the
configuration file on <em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em> (the primary
master) looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">directory /var/named

primary  movie.edu                db.movie.edu
primary  249.249.192.in-addr.arpa db.192.249.249
primary  253.253.192.in-addr.arpa db.192.253.253
primary  0.0.127.in-addr.arpa     db.127.0.0
cache    .                        db.cache</pre></blockquote>


We copy <em class="filename">/etc/named.conf</em>,
<em class="filename">db.cache</em>, and <em class="filename">db.127.0.0</em> to
<em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, and edit
the configuration file as previously described. The BIND 4
configuration file on <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> now looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">directory /var/named

secondary  movie.edu                192.249.249.3 bak.movie.edu
secondary  249.249.192.in-addr.arpa 192.249.249.3 bak.192.249.249
secondary  253.253.192.in-addr.arpa 192.249.249.3 bak.192.253.253
primary    0.0.127.in-addr.arpa     db.127.0.0
cache      .                        db.cache</pre></blockquote>


The equivalent BIND 8 or 9 configuration file looks like this:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">options {
        directory "/var/named";
};

zone "movie.edu" in {
        type slave;
        file "bak.movie.edu";
        masters { 192.249.249.3; };
};

zone "249.249.192.in-addr.arpa" in {
        type slave;
        file "bak.192.249.249";
        masters { 192.249.249.3; };
};

zone "253.253.192.in-addr.arpa" in {
        type slave;
        file "db.192.253.253";
        masters { 192.249.249.3; };
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" in {
        type master;
        file "db.127.0.0";
};

zone "." in {
        type hint;
        file "db.cache";
};</pre></blockquote>


This causes the name server on <em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em> to load <em class="emphasis">movie.edu</em>, <em class="emphasis">249.249.192.in-addr.arpa</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">253.253.192.in-addr.arpa</em>
over the network from the name server at 192.249.249.3 (<em class="emphasis">terminator.movie.edu</em>). It also saves a
backup copy of these files in <em class="filename">/var/named</em>. You
may find it handy to isolate the backup zone data files in a
subdirectory. We name them with a unique prefix like
<em class="filename">bak</em>, since on rare occasions, we may have to
delete all of the backup files manually. It's also helpful to
be able to tell at a glance that they're backup zone data files
so that we're not tempted to edit them. We'll cover more
on backup files later.</p><p>


Now start up the <a name="INDEX-612" />
<a name="INDEX-613" />slave name server. Check for
<a name="INDEX-614" /> <a name="INDEX-615" />error messages in the
<a name="INDEX-616" /><em class="filename">syslog</em> file as you did
for the primary master server. As on the primary master, the command
to start up a name server is:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>/usr/sbin/named</b></tt></pre></blockquote>


One extra check to make on the slave that you didn't have to
make on the primary master is to see that the name server created the
backup files. Shortly after we started our slave name server on
<em class="emphasis">wormhole.movie.edu</em>, we saw
<em class="filename">bak.movie.edu</em>,
<em class="filename">bak.192.249.249</em>, and
<em class="filename">bak.192.253.253</em> appear in the
<em class="filename">/var/named</em> directory. This means the slave has
successfully loaded these zones from the primary master and saved a
backup copy.</p><p>


To complete setting up your slave name server, try looking up the
same domain names you looked up after you started the primary master
server. This time, you must run <a name="INDEX-617" /> <a name="INDEX-618" /><em class="filename">nslookup</em> on
the host running the slave name server so that the slave server is
queried. If your slave is working fine, add the proper lines to your
system <a name="INDEX-619" />
<a name="INDEX-620" />startup files so that the slave name
server is started when your system boots up and
<em class="filename">hostname(1)</em><a name="INDEX-621" />
is set to a domain name.<a name="INDEX-622" /> <a name="INDEX-623" /></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-8.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.2. Backup Files</h3>


<a name="INDEX-624" /> <a name="INDEX-625" /> <a name="INDEX-626" />Slave
<a name="INDEX-627" />name servers are not
<em class="emphasis">required</em> to save a backup copy of the zone data.
If there is a backup copy, the slave server reads it on startup and
later checks with the master server to see if the master server has a
newer copy instead of loading a new copy of the zone immediately. If
the master server has a newer copy, the slave pulls it over and saves
it in the backup file.</p><p>


Why save a backup copy? Suppose the master name server is down when
the slave starts up. The slave will be unable to transfer the zone
and therefore won't function as a name server for that zone
until the master server is up. With a backup copy, the slave has zone
data, although it might be slightly out of date. Since the slave does
not have to rely on the master server always being up, it's a
more robust setup.</p><p>


To run without a backup copy, omit the filename at the end of the
<em class="emphasis">secondary</em> lines in the BIND 4 configuration
file. In BIND 8 or 9, remove the <em class="emphasis">file</em> line.
However, we recommend configuring all your slave name servers to save
backup copies. There is very little extra cost to saving a backup
zone data file, but there is a very high cost if you get caught
without a backup file when you need it most.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-8.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.3. SOA Values</h3>


<a name="INDEX-628" />Remember <a name="INDEX-629" />this SOA record?</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">movie.edu. IN SOA terminator.movie.edu. al.robocop.movie.edu. (
                          1        ; Serial
                          3h       ; Refresh after 3 hours
                          1h       ; Retry after 1 hour
                          1w       ; Expire after 1 week
                          1h )     ; Negative caching TTL of 1 day</pre></blockquote>


We never explained what the values between the parentheses were for.</p><p>


The serial number applies to all the data within the zone. We chose
to start our serial number at 1, a logical place to start. But many
people find it more useful to use the date in the serial number
instead, like 1997102301. This format is YYYYMMDDNN, where YYYY is
the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, and NN is a count of how
many times the zone data was modified that day. These fields
won't work in any other order, since no other order gives a
value that always increases as the date changes. This is critical:
whatever format you choose, it's important that the serial
number always increase when you update your zone data.</p><p>


When a slave name server contacts a master server for zone data, it
first asks for the serial number on the data. If the slave's
serial number for the zone is lower than the master server's,
the slave's zone data is out of date. In this case, the slave
pulls a new copy of the zone. If a slave starts up and there is no
backup file to read, it will always load the zone. As you might
guess, when you modify the zone data files on the primary master, you
must increment the serial number. Updating your zone data files is
covered in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Maintaining BIND"</a>.</p><p>


The next four fields specify various time intervals, in seconds by
default:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>refresh</i></dt>
<dd>The <a name="INDEX-630" />refresh
interval tells a slave for the zone how often to check that the data
for this zone is up to date. To give you an idea of the system load
this feature causes, a slave makes one SOA query per zone per refresh
interval. The value we chose, three hours, is reasonably aggressive.
Most users will tolerate a delay of half a working day for things
like zone data to propagate when they are waiting for their new
workstation to become operational. If you provide one-day service for
your site, you could consider raising this value to eight hours. If
your zone data doesn't change very often or if all of your
slaves are spread over long distances (as the root name servers are),
consider a value that is even longer, say 24 hours.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>retry</i></dt>
<dd>If the slave fails to reach the master name server after the refresh
interval (the host could be down), it starts trying to connect every
<em class="emphasis">retry</em><a name="INDEX-631" /> seconds. Normally, the retry interval
is shorter than the refresh interval, but it doesn't have to
be.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>expire</i></dt>
<dd>If the slave fails to contact the master name server for
<em class="emphasis">expire</em> seconds, the slave expires the zone.
Expiring the zone means that the slave stops giving out answers about
the zone because the zone data is too old to be useful. Essentially,
this field says that at some point, the data is so old that giving
out no data is better than giving out stale data. Expire times on the
order of a week are common -- longer (up to a month) if you
frequently have problems reaching your updating source. The
<a name="INDEX-632" />expiration time
should always be much larger than the retry and refresh intervals; if
the expire time is smaller than the refresh interval, your slaves
will expire the zone before trying to load new data.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>negative caching TTL</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-633" />
<a name="INDEX-634" />TTL stands for <em class="firstterm">time to
live</em>. This value applies to all negative responses from
the name servers authoritative for the zone.</p></dd>

</dl>



<a name="ch04-35-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP: </b>
On versions of BIND before BIND 8.2, the last field in the SOA record
is <em class="emphasis">both</em> the default time to live and the
negative caching time to live for the zone.</p><p>

</blockquote>

Those of you who have read earlier versions of this book may have
noticed the change in the format we used for the SOA record's
numeric fields. Once upon a time, BIND only understood units of
seconds for the four fields we just described. (Consequently, a whole
generation of administrators know that there are 608400 seconds in a
week.) Now, with all but the oldest BIND name servers (4.8.3), you
can specify units besides seconds for these fields and as arguments
to the TTL control statement, as we saw early in this chapter. For
example, you can specify a three-hour refresh interval with
<em class="emphasis">3h</em>, <em class="emphasis">180m</em>, or even
<em class="emphasis">2h60m</em>. You can also use <em class="emphasis">d</em>
for days and <em class="emphasis">w</em> for weeks.</p><p>


The right values for your <a name="INDEX-635" />SOA record depend upon the
needs of your site. In general, longer times cause less load on your
name servers and can delay the propagation of changes; shorter times
increase the load on your name servers and speed up the propagation
of changes. The values we use in this book should work well for most
sites. RFC 1537 recommends the following values for top-level name
servers:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Refresh        24 hours
Retry           2 hours
Expire         30 days
Default TTL     4 days</pre></blockquote>


There is one implementation feature you should be aware of. Older
versions (pre-4.8.3) of BIND slaves stop answering queries during a
zone load. As a result, BIND was modified to spread out the zone
loads, reducing the periods of unavailability. So, even if you set a
low refresh interval, your slaves may not check as often as you
request. BIND attempts a certain number of zone loads and then waits
15 minutes before trying another batch.</p><p>


Now that we've told you all about how slave name servers poll
to keep their data up to date, BIND 8 and 9 change how zone data
propagates! The polling feature is still there, but BIND 8 and 9 add
a notification when zone data changes. If both your primary master
server and your slaves run BIND 8 or 9, the primary master
<a name="INDEX-636" />notifies the
slave that a zone has changed within 15 minutes of loading a new copy
of that zone. The notification causes the slave server to shorten the
refresh interval and attempt to load the zone immediately.
We'll discuss this more in<a name="INDEX-637" /> <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>.<a name="INDEX-638" /></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-4-SECT-8.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.8.4. Multiple Master Servers</h3>


<a name="INDEX-639" />Are there
other ways to make your slave name server's configuration more
robust? Yes -- you can specify up to 10 IP addresses of
<a name="INDEX-640" />master servers. In a BIND 4 configuration
file, just add them after the first IP address and before the backup
filename. In a BIND 8 or 9 configuration file, add them after the
first IP address and separate them with semicolons:</p><p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">masters { 192.249.249.3; 192.249.249.4; };</pre></blockquote>


The slave will query the master server at each IP address in the
order listed until it gets a response. Through BIND 8.1.2, the slave
would always transfer the zone from the first master name server to
respond if that master had a higher <a name="INDEX-641" />serial number. The slave would try
successive master servers only if the previous master didn't
respond. From BIND 8.2 on, however, the slave actually queries all of
the master name servers listed and transfers the zone from the one
with the highest serial number. If multiple master servers tie for
the highest serial number, the slave transfers the zone from the
first of those masters in the list.</p><p>


The original intent of this feature was to allow you to list all the
IP addresses of the host running the primary master name server for
the zone if that host were multihomed. But since there is no check to
determine whether the contacted server is a primary master or a
slave, you can list the IP addresses of hosts running slave servers
for the zone if that makes sense for your setup. That way, if the
first master server is down or unreachable, your slave can transfer
the zone from another master name server.<a name="INDEX-642" /></p><p>
