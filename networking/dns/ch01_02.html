<h2 class="sect1">1.2. On the Internet and internets</h2>


<a name="INDEX-19" />
<a name="INDEX-20" />A word on
"the Internet" and "internets" in general is
in order. In print, the difference between the two seems slight: one
is always capitalized, one isn't. The distinction in meaning,
however, <em class="emphasis">is</em> significant. The Internet, with a
capital "I," refers to the network that began its life as
the ARPAnet and continues today as, roughly, the confederation of all
TCP/IP networks directly or indirectly connected to commercial U.S.
backbones. Seen close up, it's actually quite a few different
networks -- commercial TCP/IP backbones, corporate and U.S.
government TCP/IP networks, and TCP/IP networks in other
countries -- interconnected by routers and high-speed digital
circuits.</p><p>


A lowercase internet, on the other hand, is simply any network made
up of multiple smaller networks using the same internetworking
protocols. An internet (little "i") isn't
necessarily connected to the Internet (big "I"), nor does
it necessarily use TCP/IP as its internetworking protocol. There are
isolated corporate internets, and there are Xerox XNS-based internets
and DECnet-based internets.</p><p>


The relatively new term
"<a name="INDEX-21" />
<a name="INDEX-22" />
<a name="INDEX-23" />intranet" is really just a
marketing term for a TCP/IP-based "little i"
<a name="INDEX-24" />internet,
used to emphasize the use of technologies developed and introduced on
the Internet within a company's internal corporate network. On
the other hand, an
"<a name="INDEX-25" />extranet"
is a TCP/IP-based internet that connects partner companies to each
other, or a company to its distributors, suppliers, and customers.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-1-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.1. The History of the Domain Name System</h3>


<a name="INDEX-26" />Through
the 1970s, the ARPAnet was a small, friendly community of a few
hundred hosts. A single file, <a name="INDEX-27" /><em class="emphasis">HOSTS.TXT</em>, contained
all the information you needed to know about those hosts: it held
name-to-address mappings for every host connected to the ARPAnet. The
familiar Unix host table,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em><a name="INDEX-28" />, was derived from
<em class="emphasis">HOSTS.TXT</em> (mostly by deleting fields that Unix
didn't use).</p><p>


<em class="emphasis">HOSTS.TXT</em> was maintained by SRI's
<a name="INDEX-29" /><em class="emphasis">Network
Information Center</em> (dubbed "the
<a name="INDEX-30" />NIC") and distributed from a
single host, <a name="INDEX-31" />SRI-NIC.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a> ARPAnet administrators typically
emailed their changes to the NIC, and periodically FTPed to SRI-NIC
and grabbed the current <em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em>. Their changes
were compiled into a new <em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em> once or twice
a week. As the ARPAnet grew, however, this scheme became unworkable.
The size of <em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em> grew in proportion to the
growth in the number of ARPAnet hosts. Moreover, the traffic
generated by the update process increased even faster: every
additional host meant not only another line in
<em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em>, but potentially another host updating
from SRI-NIC.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-4" />[4]SRI is the former
Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California. SRI conducts
research into many different areas, including computer
networking.</p><p>

</blockquote>


And when the ARPAnet moved to the TCP/IP protocols, the population of
the network exploded. Now there was a host of problems with
<em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em>:</p><p>


<dl>
<dt><i>Traffic and load</i></dt>
<dd>The toll on SRI-NIC, in terms of the network
<a name="INDEX-32" />traffic and
<a name="INDEX-33" />processor
load involved in distributing the file, was becoming unbearable.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Name collisions</i></dt>
<dd><a name="INDEX-34" />
<a name="INDEX-35" /><a name="INDEX-36" />No two hosts in
<em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em> could have the same name. However,
while the NIC could assign addresses in a way that guaranteed their
uniqueness, it had no authority over host names. There was nothing to
prevent someone from adding a host with a conflicting name and
breaking the whole scheme. Someone adding a host with the same name
as a major mail hub, for example, could disrupt mail service to much
of the ARPAnet.</p></dd>

</dl>


<dl>
<dt><i>Consistency</i></dt>
<dd>Maintaining consistency of the file across an expanding network
became harder and harder. By the time a new
<em class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</em> reached the farthest shores of the
enlarged ARPAnet, a host across the network had changed addresses, or
a new host had sprung up that users wanted to reach.</p></dd>

</dl>


The essential problem was that the <em class="emphasis">HOSTS.TXT</em>
mechanism didn't scale well. Ironically, the success of the
ARPAnet as an experiment led to the failure and obsolescence of
<em class="emphasis">HOSTS.TXT</em>.</p><p>


The ARPAnet's governing bodies chartered an investigation into
a successor for <em class="emphasis">HOSTS.TXT</em>. Their goal was to
create a system that solved the problems inherent in a unified
<a name="INDEX-37" />host table
system. The new system should allow local administration of data, yet
still make that data globally available. The decentralization of
administration would eliminate the single-host bottleneck and relieve
the traffic problem. And local management would make the task of
keeping data up to date much easier. The new system should use a
hierarchical namespace to name hosts, thus ensuring the uniqueness of
names.</p><p>


Paul <a name="INDEX-38" />Mockapetris, then of USC's
Information Sciences Institute, was responsible for designing the
architecture of the new system. In 1984, he released
<a name="INDEX-39" />RFCs 882 and
883, which described the Domain Name System. These RFCs were
superseded by <a name="INDEX-40" />
<a name="INDEX-41" />RFCs 1034 and 1035,
the current specifications of the Domain Name System.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a> RFCs
1034 and 1035 have now been augmented by many other RFCs, describing
potential DNS security problems, implementation problems,
administrative gotchas, mechanisms for dynamically updating name
servers and securing zone data, and more.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-5" />[5]RFCs are <a name="INDEX-42" />Request for
Comments documents, part of the relatively informal procedure for
introducing new technology on the Internet. RFCs are usually freely
distributed and contain fairly technical descriptions of the
technology, often intended for implementors.</p><p>
