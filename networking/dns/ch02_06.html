<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Resolution</h2>


<a name="INDEX-191" />
<a name="INDEX-192" />Name servers are
adept at retrieving data from the domain name space. They have to be,
given the limited intelligence of most resolvers. Not only can they
give you data from zones for which they're authoritative, they
can also search through the domain name space to find data for which
they're not authoritative. This process is called
<em class="emphasis">name resolution</em> or simply
<em class="emphasis">resolution</em>.</p><p>


Because the namespace is structured as an inverted tree, a name
server needs only one piece of information to find its way to any
point in the tree: the domain names and addresses of the root name
servers (is that more than one piece?). A name server can issue a
query to a root name server for any domain name in the domain name
space, and the root name server starts the name server on its way.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.1. Root Name Servers</h3>


The <a name="INDEX-193" />
<a name="INDEX-194" />root name servers know where the
authoritative name servers for each of the top-level zones are. (In
fact, some of the root name servers are authoritative for the generic
top-level zones.) Given a query about any domain name, the root name
servers can provide at least the names and addresses of the name
servers that are authoritative for the top-level zone that the domain
name ends in. And the top-level name servers can provide the list of
the authoritative name servers for the second-level zone that the
domain name ends in. Each name server queried gives the querier
information about how to get "closer" to the answer
it's seeking, or it provides the answer itself.</p><p>


The root name servers are clearly important to
<a name="INDEX-195" />resolution. Because they're so
important, DNS provides mechanisms -- such as caching, which
we'll discuss a little later -- to help offload the root
name servers. But in the absence of other information, resolution has
to start at the root name servers. This makes the root name servers
crucial to the operation of DNS; if all the Internet root name
servers were unreachable for an extended period, all resolution on
the Internet would fail. To protect against this, the Internet has 13
root name servers (as of this writing) spread across different parts
of the network. For example, one is on PSINet, a commercial Internet
backbone; one is on the NASA Science Internet; two are in Europe; and
one is in Japan.</p><p>


Being the focal point for so many queries keeps the roots busy; even
with 13, the <a name="INDEX-196" />traffic to each root name
server is very high. A recent informal poll of root name server
administrators showed some roots receiving thousands of queries per
second.</p><p>


Despite the load placed on root name servers, resolution on the
Internet works quite well. <a href="ch02_06.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-12">Figure 2-12</a> shows the
resolution process for the address of a real host in a real domain,
including how the process corresponds to traversing the domain name
space tree.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-12" /><div class="figure"><img height="411" alt="Figure 2-12" src="figs/dns4_0212.gif" width="468" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-12. Resolution of girigiri.gbrmpa.gov.au on the Internet</h4>

The local name server queries a root name server for the address of
<em class="emphasis">girigiri.gbrmpa.gov.au</em> and is referred to the
<em class="emphasis">au</em> name servers. The local name server asks an
<em class="emphasis">au</em> name server the same question, and is
referred to the <em class="emphasis">gov.au</em> name servers. The
<em class="emphasis">gov.au</em> name server refers the local name server
to the <em class="emphasis">gbrmpa.gov.au</em> name servers. Finally, the
local name server asks a <em class="emphasis">gbrmpa.gov.au</em> name
server for the address and gets the answer.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.2. Recursion</h3>


<a name="INDEX-197" />You may have noticed a big difference in
the amount of work done by the name servers in the previous example.
Four of the name servers simply returned the best answer they already
had -- mostly referrals to other name servers -- to the queries
they received. They didn't have to send their own queries to
find the data requested. But one name server -- the one queried by
the resolver -- had to follow successive referrals until it
received an answer.</p><p>


Why couldn't the local name server simply have referred the
resolver to another name server? Because a stub resolver
wouldn't have had the intelligence to follow a referral. And
how did the name server know not to answer with a referral? Because
the resolver issued a <a name="INDEX-198" />recursive query.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-199" />Queries come in two flavors,
<em class="emphasis">recursive</em> and
<em class="emphasis">iterative</em><a name="INDEX-200" />
<a name="INDEX-201" /> (or
<a name="INDEX-202" /><em class="emphasis">nonrecursive</em>).
Recursive queries place most of the burden of resolution on a single
name server. <em class="emphasis">Recursion</em>, or <em class="emphasis">recursive
resolution</em>, is just a name for the resolution process used
by a name server when it receives recursive queries. As with
recursive algorithms in programming, the name server repeats the same
basic process (querying a remote name server and following any
referrals) until it receives an answer.
<em class="emphasis">Iteration</em><a name="INDEX-203" />,
or <em class="emphasis">iterative
resolution</em><a name="INDEX-204" />, described in the next section,
refers to the resolution process used by a name server when it
receives iterative queries.</p><p>


In recursion, a resolver sends a recursive query to a name server for
information about a particular domain name. The queried name server
is then obliged to respond with the requested data or with an error
stating that data of the requested type doesn't exist or that
the domain name specified doesn't exist.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a> The name server can't just refer
the querier to a different name server because the query was
recursive.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-14" />[14]BIND 8
name servers can be configured to ignore or refuse recursive queries;
see <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "Security"</a>, for how and why you'd want to
do this.</p><p>

</blockquote>


If the queried name server isn't authoritative for the data
requested, it will have to query other name servers to find the
answer. It could send recursive queries to those name servers,
thereby obliging them to find the answer and return it (and passing
the buck). Or it could send iterative queries and possibly be
referred to other name servers "closer" to the domain
name it's looking for. Current implementations are polite and
do the latter, following the referrals until an answer is
found.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-15">[15]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-15" />[15]The exception is a name server configured to
forward all unresolved queries to a designated name server, called a
forwarder. See <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10, "Advanced Features"</a>, for more information on
using forwarders.</p><p>

</blockquote>


A name server that receives a recursive query that it can't
answer itself will query the "closest known" name
servers. The <a name="INDEX-205" /> <a name="INDEX-206" />closest known name servers are the
servers authoritative for the zone closest to the domain name being
looked up. For example, if the name server receives a recursive query
for the address of the domain name
<em class="emphasis">girigiri.gbrmpa.gov.au</em>, it will first check
whether it knows which name servers are authoritative for
<em class="emphasis">girigiri.gbrmpa.gov.au</em>. If it does, it will send
the query to one of them. If not, it will check whether it knows the
name servers for <em class="emphasis">gbrmpa.gov.au</em>, and after that
<em class="emphasis">gov.au</em>, and then <em class="emphasis">au</em>. The
default, where the check is guaranteed to stop, is the root zone,
since every name server knows the domain names and addresses of the
root name servers.</p><p>


Using the closest known name servers ensures that the resolution
process is as short as possible. A <em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em>
name server receiving a recursive query for the address of
<em class="emphasis">waxwing.ce.berkeley.edu</em> shouldn't have to
consult the root name servers; it can simply follow delegation
information directly to the <em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> name
servers. Likewise, a name server that has just looked up a domain
name in <em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> shouldn't have to
start resolution at the roots to look up another
<em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> (or
<em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em>) domain name; we'll show how
this works in <a href="ch02_07.html#dns4-CHP-2-SECT-7">Section 2.7, "Caching"</a>.</p><p>


The name server that receives the recursive query always sends the
same query that the resolver sends it, for example, for the address
of <em class="emphasis">waxwing.ce.berkeley.edu</em>. It never sends
explicit queries for the name servers for
<em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> or
<em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em>, though this information is also
stored in the namespace. Sending explicit queries could cause
problems: there may be no <em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> name
servers (that is, <em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> may be part of
the <em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em> zone). Also, it's always
possible that an <em class="emphasis">edu</em> or
<em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em> name server already knows
<em class="emphasis">waxwing.ce.berkeley.edu</em>'s address. An
explicit query for the <em class="emphasis">berkeley.edu</em> or
<em class="emphasis">ce.berkeley.edu</em> name servers would miss this
information.<a name="INDEX-207" /></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.3. Iteration</h3>


<a name="INDEX-208" />
<a name="INDEX-209" />Iterative resolution, on the other
hand, doesn't require nearly as much work on the part of the
queried name server. In iterative resolution, a name server simply
gives the best answer <em class="emphasis">it already knows</em> back to
the querier. No additional querying is required. The queried name
server consults its local data (including its cache, which we talk
about shortly), looking for the data requested. If it doesn't
find the answer there, it finds the names and addresses of the name
servers closest to the domain name in the query in its local data,
and returns that as a referral to help the querier continue the
resolution process. Note that the referral includes <em class="emphasis">all
</em>of the name servers listed in the local data; it's
up to the querier to choose which one to query next.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.4. Choosing Between Authoritative Name Servers</h3>


Some of the card-carrying Mensa members in our reading audience may
be wondering how the <a name="INDEX-210" />name server that receives the recursive
query chooses between the name servers authoritative for the zone.
For example, we said that there are 13 root name servers on the
Internet today. Does the name server simply query the one that
appears first in the referral? Does it choose randomly?</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-211" /> <a name="INDEX-212" /> <a name="INDEX-213" />BIND name servers use a metric called
<em class="emphasis">roundtrip time</em>, or RTT,to
choose between name servers authoritative for the same zone.
Roundtrip time is a measurement of how long a remote name server
takes to respond to queries. Each time a <a name="INDEX-214" />BIND name server sends a query to a remote
name server, it starts an internal stopwatch. When it receives a
response, it stops the stopwatch and makes a note of how long that
remote name server took to respond. When the name server must choose
which of a group of authoritative name servers to query, it simply
chooses the one with the lowest RTT.</p><p>


Before a BIND name server has queried a name server, it gives it a
random RTT value, but lower than any real-world RTT. This ensures
that the BIND name server queries all of the name servers
authoritative for a given zone in a random order before playing
favorites.</p><p>


On the whole, this simple but elegant algorithm allows BIND name
servers to "lock on" to the closest name servers quickly
and without the overhead of an out-of-band mechanism to measure
performance.</p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.5. The Whole Enchilada</h3>


All of this amounts to a
<a name="INDEX-215" />resolution process that, taken as a
whole, usually looks something like <a href="ch02_06.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-13">Figure 2-13</a>.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-13" /><div class="figure"><img height="313" alt="Figure 2-13" src="figs/dns4_0213.gif" width="448" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-13. The resolution process</h4>

A resolver queries a local name server, which sends iterative queries
to a number of other name servers in pursuit of an answer for the
resolver. Each name server it queries refers it to another name
server that is authoritative for a zone further down in the namespace
and closer to the domain name sought. Finally, the local name server
queries the authoritative name server, which returns an answer. All
the while, the local name server uses each response it
receives -- whether a referral or the answer -- to update the
RTT of the responding name server, which will help it decide which
name servers to query to resolve domain names in the
future.<a name="INDEX-216" /> <a name="INDEX-217" /></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.6. Mapping Addresses to Names</h3>


<a name="INDEX-218" /> <a name="INDEX-219" />One
major piece of functionality missing from the resolution process as
explained so far is how addresses get mapped back to domain names.
Address-to-name mapping is used to produce output that is easier for
humans to read and interpret (in log files, for instance). It's
also used in some authorization checks. Unix hosts map addresses to
domain names to compare against entries in
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em> and <em class="emphasis">hosts.equiv</em>
files, for example. When using host tables, address-to-name mapping
is trivial. It requires a straightforward sequential search through
the host table for an address. The search returns the official host
name listed. In DNS, however, address-to-name mapping isn't so
simple. Data, including addresses, in the domain name space is
indexed by name. Given a domain name, finding an address is
relatively easy. But finding the domain name that maps to a given
address would seem to require an exhaustive search of the data
attached to every domain name in the tree.</p><p>


<a name="INDEX-220" />Actually, there's a better solution
that's both clever and effective. Because it's easy to
find data once you're given the domain name that indexes that
data, why not create a part of the domain name space that uses
addresses as labels? In the Internet's domain name space, this
portion is the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain.</p><p>


Nodes in the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain are labeled
after the numbers in the <a name="INDEX-221" />dotted-octet
representation of IP addresses. (Dotted-octet representation refers
to the common method of expressing 32-bit <a name="INDEX-222" />IP addresses as four numbers in the
range
to 255, separated by dots.) The <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>
domain, for example, could have up to 256 subdomains, one
corresponding to each possible value in the first
<a name="INDEX-223" />octet of an IP
address. Each of these subdomains could have up to 256 subdomains of
its own, corresponding to the possible values of the second octet.
Finally, at the fourth level down, there are resource records
attached to the final octet giving the full domain name of the host
at that IP address. That makes for an awfully big domain:
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>, shown in <a href="ch02_06.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-14">Figure 2-14</a>, is roomy enough for every IP address on the
Internet.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-14" /><div class="figure"><img height="345" alt="Figure 2-14" src="figs/dns4_0214.gif" width="420" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-14. The in-addr.arpa domain</h4>

Note that when read in a domain name, the IP address appears backward
because the name is read from leaf to root. For example, if
<em class="emphasis">winnie.corp.hp.com</em>'s IP address is
15.16.192.152, the corresponding node in the
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain is
<em class="emphasis">152.192.16.15.in-addr.arpa</em>, which maps back to
the domain name <em class="emphasis">winnie.corp.hp.com</em>.</p><p>


IP addresses could have been represented the opposite way in the
namespace, with the first octet of the IP address at the bottom of
the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain. That way, the IP
address would have read correctly (forward) in the domain name.</p><p>


IP addresses are hierarchical, however, just like domain names.
Network numbers are doled out much as domain names are, and
administrators can then subnet their address space and further
delegate numbering. The difference is that IP addresses get more
specific from left to right, while domain names get less specific
from left to right. <a href="ch02_06.html#dns4-CHP-2-FIG-15">Figure 2-15</a> shows what we mean.</p><p>


<a name="dns4-CHP-2-FIG-15" /><div class="figure"><img height="93" alt="Figure 2-15" src="figs/dns4_0215.gif" width="331" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-15. Hierarchical names and addresses</h4>

Making the first octets in the IP address appear highest in the tree
gives administrators the ability to delegate authority for
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> zones along network lines. For
example, the <em class="emphasis">15.in-addr.arpa</em> zone, which
contains the reverse-mapping information for all hosts whose IP
addresses start with 15, can be delegated to the administrators of
network 15.0.0.0. This would be impossible if the octets appeared in
the opposite order. If the IP addresses were represented the other
way around, <em class="emphasis">15.in-addr.arpa</em> would consist of
every host whose IP address <em class="emphasis">ended</em> with
15 -- not a practical zone to try to delegate.<a name="INDEX-224" /> <a name="INDEX-225" /></p><p>
</div>




<a name="dns4-CHP-2-SECT-6.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.7. Inverse Queries</h3>


The <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain is clearly useful only
for IP address-to-domain name mapping.
<a name="INDEX-226" />Searching
for a domain name that indexes an <em class="emphasis">arbitrary</em>
piece of data -- something besides an address -- in the domain
name space would require another specialized namespace, such as
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>, or an exhaustive search.<a name="INDEX-227" /></p><p>


That <a name="INDEX-228" />
<a name="INDEX-229" />exhaustive
search is to some extent possible, and it's called an
<a name="INDEX-230" />
<a name="INDEX-231" /><em class="emphasis">inverse
query</em>. An inverse query is a search for the domain name
that indexes a given datum. It's processed solely by the name
server receiving the query. That name server searches all its local
data for the item sought and, if possible, returns the domain name
that indexes it. If it can't find the data, it gives up. No
attempt is made to consult another name server.</p><p>


Because any one name server knows about only part of the overall
domain name space, an inverse query is never guaranteed to return an
answer. For example, if a name server receives an inverse query for
an IP address it knows nothing about, it can't return an
answer, but it also doesn't know that the IP address
doesn't exist, because it holds only part of the DNS database.
What's more, the implementation of inverse queries is optional
according to the DNS specification; BIND 4.9.8 still contains the
code that implements inverse queries, but it's commented out by
default. Neither BIND 8 nor BIND 9 includes that code at all, though
they do recognize inverse queries and can make up fake responses to
them.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-16">[16]</a>
That's fine with us, because very little software (such as
archaic versions of
<em class="emphasis">nslookup</em><a name="INDEX-232" />) actually still uses inverse
queries.<a name="INDEX-233" /></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-16" />[16]For details on this functionality, see
