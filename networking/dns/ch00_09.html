<h2 class="sect1">0.9. Acknowledgments</h2>


The authors would like to thank Ken Stone, Jerry McCollom, Peter
Jeffe, Hal Stern, Christopher Durham, Bill Wisner, Dave Curry, Jeff
Okamoto, Brad Knowles, K. Robert Elz, and Paul Vixie for their
invaluable contributions to this book. We'd also like to thank
our reviewers, Eric Pearce, Jack Repenning, Andrew Cherenson, Dan
Trinkle, Bill LeFebvre, and John Sechrest for their criticism and
suggestions. Without their help, this book would not be what it is
(it'd be much shorter!).</p><p>


For the second edition, the authors add their thanks to their
sterling review team: Dave Barr, Nigel Campbell, Bill LeFebvre, Mike
Milligan, and Dan Trinkle.</p><p>


For the third edition, the authors salute their technical review
Dream Team: Bob Halley, Barry Margolin, and Paul Vixie.</p><p>


For the fourth edition, the authors owe a debt of gratitude to Kevin
Dunlap, Edward Lewis, and Brian Wellington, their crack review squad.</p><p>


Cricket would particularly like to thank his former manager, Rick
Nordensten, the very model of a modern HP manager, on whose watch the
first version of this book was written; his neighbors, who bore his
occasional crabbiness for many months; and of course his wife, Paige,
for her unflagging support and for putting up with his
tap-tap-tapping during her nap-nap-napping. For the second edition,
Cricket would like to add a thank you to his former managers, Regina
Kershner and Paul Klouda, for their support of Cricket's work
with the Internet. For the third edition, Cricket acknowledges a debt
of gratitude to his partner, Matt Larson, for his co-development of
the Acme Razor. For the fourth edition, Cricket thanks his loyal,
furry fans, Dakota and Annie, for kisses and companionship, and
wonderful Walter B., for popping his head into the office and
checking on Dad now and again. Paul would like to thank his wife,
Katherine, for her patience, for many review sessions, and for
proving that she could make a quilt in her spare time more quickly
than her spouse could write his half of a book.</p><p>


We would also like to thank the folks at O'Reilly &amp;
Associates for their hard work and patience. Credit is especially due
our editors, Mike Loukides (first through third editions) and Debra
Cameron (fourth edition), as well as countless others who worked on
the various editions: Nancy Kotary, Ellie Fountain Maden, Robert
Romano, Steven Abrams, Kismet McDonough-Chan, Seth Maislin, Ellie
Cutler, Mike Sierra, Lenny Muellner, Chris Reilley, Emily Quill,
Anne-Marie Vaduva, and Brenda Miller. Thanks besides to Jerry Peek
for all sorts of miscellaneous help and to Tim O'Reilly for
inspiring us to put it all in print.</p><p>


And thanks, Edie, for the cricket on the cover!</p><p>
