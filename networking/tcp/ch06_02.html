<h2 class="sect1">6.2. TCP/IP Over a Serial Line </h2>

<p>TCP/IP runs <a name="INDEX-1247" /> <a name="INDEX-1248" />
<a name="INDEX-1249" />over a wide variety of physical
media. The media can be Ethernet cables, as in your local Ethernet,
or telephone circuits, as in a wide area network. In the first half
of this chapter, we used <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> to configure a
local Ethernet interface. In this section, we use other commands to
configure a network interface to use a telephone circuit.
</p>

<p>Almost all data communication takes place via serial interfaces. A
<em class="emphasis">serial interface</em> is just an interface that sends
the data as a series of bits over a single wire, as opposed to a
parallel interface that sends the data bits in parallel over several
wires simultaneously. This description of a serial interface would
fit almost any communications interface (including Ethernet itself),
but the term is usually applied to an interface that connects to a
telephone circuit via a modem or similar device. Likewise, a
telephone circuit is often called a serial line.
</p>

<p>In the TCP/IP world, serial lines are used to create
<a name="INDEX-1250" /><a name="INDEX-1251" />wide area
networks (WANs). Unfortunately, TCP/IP has not always had a standard
physical layer protocol for serial lines. Because of the lack of a
standard, network designers were forced to use a single brand of
routers within their WANs to ensure successful physical layer
communication. The growth of TCP/IP WANs led to a strong interest in
standardizing serial line communications to provide vendor
independence.
</p>

<p>Other forces that increased interest in serial line communications
were the advent of small, affordable systems that run TCP/IP, and the
advent of high-speed, dial-up modems that provide
"reasonable" TCP/IP performance. When the ARPAnet was
formed, computers were very expensive and dial-up modems were very
slow. At that time, if you could afford a computer, you could afford
a leased telephone line. In recent years, however, it has become
possible to own a Unix system at home. In this new environment, there
is a strong demand for services that allow TCP/IP access over dial-up
modems. Currently, approximately 7% of home users have a high-speed
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connection or a cable modem. Most DSL
and cable modems connect to the host via Ethernet, meaning that no
special host configuration is required to use those services. But
most home users still use dial-up serial lines. Dial-up serial lines
require special protocols and special configurations.
</p>

<p>These two forces -- the need for standardized wide area
communications and the need for dial-up TCP/IP access -- led to
the creation of two serial line protocols: Serial Line IP (SLIP) and
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-58">[58]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-58" /><p>[58]Dial-up modems are
usually asynchronous. Both PPP and SLIP support asynchronous dial-up
service as well as synchronous leased-line service.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">6.2.1. The Serial Protocols </h3>

<p>Serial Line IP was <a name="INDEX-1252" />
<a name="INDEX-1253" />created first. It is a minimal protocol that
allows isolated hosts to link via TCP/IP over the telephone network.
The SLIP protocol defines a simple mechanism for framing datagrams
for transmission across serial lines. SLIP sends the datagram across
the serial line as a series of bytes, and it uses special characters
to mark when a series of bytes should be grouped together as a
datagram. SLIP defines two special characters for this purpose:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1254" />SLIP
END character, a single byte with the decimal value 192, is the
character that marks the end of a datagram. When the receiving SLIP
encounters the END character, it knows that it has a complete
datagram that can be sent up to IP.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1255" />SLIP
ESC character, a single byte with the decimal value of 219, is used
to "escape" the SLIP control characters. If the sending
SLIP encounters a byte value equivalent to either a SLIP END
character or a SLIP ESC character in the datagram it is sending, it
converts that character to a sequence of two characters. The
two-character sequences are ESC 220 for the END character, and ESC
221 for the ESC character itself.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-59">[59]</a> When the receiving SLIP encounters these two-byte
sequences, it converts them back to single-byte values. This
procedure prevents the receiving SLIP from incorrectly interpreting a
data byte as the end of the datagram.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-59" /><p>[59]Here ESC refers to
the SLIP escape character, not the ASCII escape character.</p>
</blockquote>
</li></ul>
<p>SLIP is described in <a name="INDEX-1256" />RFC 1055, <em class="emphasis">A Nonstandard for
Transmission of IP Datagrams Over Serial Lines: SLIP</em>. As
the name of the RFC makes clear, SLIP is not an Internet standard.
The RFC does not propose a standard; it documents an existing
protocol. The RFC identifies the deficiencies in
<a name="INDEX-1257" />SLIP,
which fall into two categories:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The SLIP protocol does not define any link control information that
could be used to dynamically control the characteristics of a
connection. Therefore, SLIP systems must assume certain link
characteristics. Because of this limitation, SLIP can be used only
when both hosts know each other's addresses, and only when IP
datagrams are being transmitted.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>SLIP does not compensate for noisy, low-speed telephone lines. The
protocol does not provide error correction or data compression.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>To address SLIP's weaknesses,
<a name="INDEX-1258" /><a name="INDEX-1259" />Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP) was developed as an Internet standard. There are
several RFCs that document Point-to-Point Protocol.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-60">[60]</a> Two key documents are
<a name="INDEX-1260" />RFC 1661,
<em class="emphasis">The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)</em>, and
<a name="INDEX-1261" />RFC 1172,
<em class="emphasis">The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Initial Configuration
Options</em>.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-60" /><p>[60]If you want to make sure you have the very latest version of a
standard, obtain the latest list of RFCs as described in <a href="appg_01.html">Appendix G, "RFC Excerpts"</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>PPP addresses the weaknesses of SLIP with a three-layered protocol:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Data Link Layer Protocol</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1262" />Data Link Layer Protocol used by PPP is
a slightly modified version of <a name="INDEX-1263" /><a name="INDEX-1264" />High-level Data
Link Control (HDLC). PPP modifies HDLC by adding a Protocol field
that allows PPP to pass traffic for multiple Network Layer protocols.
HDLC is an international standard protocol for reliably sending data
over synchronous, serial communications lines. PPP also uses a
proposed international standard for transmitting HDLC over
asynchronous lines, so PPP can guarantee reliable delivery over any
type of serial line.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Link Control Protocol</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1265" /><a name="INDEX-1266" />Link Control Protocol (LCP) provides
control information for the serial link. It is used to establish the
connection, negotiate configuration parameters, check link quality,
and close the connection. LCP was developed specifically for PPP.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Network Control protocols</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1267" />Network Control protocols are
individual protocols that provide configuration and control
information for the Network Layer protocols. Remember, PPP is
designed to pass data for a wide variety of network protocols. NCP
allows PPP to be customized to do just that. Each network protocol
(DECNET, IP, OSI, etc.) has its own Network Control protocol. The
Network Control protocol defined in RFCs 1661 and 1332 is the
<a name="INDEX-1268" /><a name="INDEX-1269" />Internet Control Protocol
(IPCP), which supports Internet Protocol.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Point-to-Point Protocol is the best TCP/IP serial protocol. PPP is
preferred because it is an Internet standard, which ensures
interoperability between systems from a wide variety of vendors. It
has more features than SLIP and is more robust. These benefits make
PPP the best choice as an open protocol for connecting routers over
serial lines and for connecting remote computers via dial-up lines.
</p>

<p>Some Linux systems include both SLIP and PPP. However, on most Unix
systems, such as Solaris, PPP is included and SLIP is not. This is
fine, as you should avoid using SLIP and use PPP instead.
