<h2 class="sect1">13.4. Troubleshooting Network Access </h2>

<p>The "no answer" and "cannot connect" errors
indicate a problem in the lower layers of the network protocols. If
the preliminary tests point to this type of problem, concentrate your
testing on routing and on the network interface. Use the
<tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt>, <tt class="literal">netstat</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">arp</tt> commands to test the Network Access Layer.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.1. Troubleshooting with the ifconfig Command </h3>

<p><tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> checks
<a name="INDEX-2883" />
<a name="INDEX-2884" />
<a name="INDEX-2885" />
<a name="INDEX-2886" />the network interface configuration. Use
this command to verify the user's configuration if the
user's system has been recently configured or if the
user's system cannot reach the remote host while other systems
on the same network can.
</p>

<p>When <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> is entered with an interface name
and no other arguments, it displays the current values assigned to
that interface. For example, checking interface dnet0 on a Solaris 8
system gives this report:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">ifconfig dnet0</b> 
dnet0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 2
        inet 172.16.55.105 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 172.16.55.255</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> command displays two lines of output.
The first line of the display shows the interface's name and
its characteristics. Check for these characteristics:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>UP</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The interface is enabled for use. If the interface is
"down," have the system's superuser bring the
interface "up" with the <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt>
command (e.g., <tt class="literal">ifconfig dnet0 up</tt>). If the
interface won't come up, replace the interface cable and try
again. If it still fails, have the interface hardware checked.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>RUNNING</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This interface is operational. If the interface is not
"running," the driver for this interface may not be
properly installed. The system administrator should review all of the
steps necessary to install this interface, looking for errors or
missed steps.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The second line of <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> output shows the IP
address, the subnet mask (written in hexadecimal), and the broadcast
address. Check these three fields to make sure the network interface
is properly configured.
</p>

<p>Two common interface configuration problems are misconfigured subnet
masks and incorrect IP addresses. A bad subnet mask is indicated when
the host can reach other hosts on its local subnet and remote hosts
on distant networks, but it cannot reach hosts on other local
subnets. <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> quickly reveals if a bad subnet
mask is set.
</p>

<p>An incorrectly set IP address can be a subtle problem. If the network
part of the address is incorrect, every <tt class="literal">ping</tt> will
fail with the "no answer" error. In this case, using
<tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> will reveal the incorrect address.
However, if the host part of the address is wrong, the problem can be
more difficult to detect. A small system, such as a PC that only
connects out to other systems and never accepts incoming connections,
can run for a long time with the wrong address without its user
noticing the problem. Additionally, the system that suffers the ill
effects may not be the one that is misconfigured. It is possible for
someone to accidentally use your IP address on his system, and for
his mistake to cause your system intermittent communications
problems. An example of this problem is discussed later. This type of
configuration error cannot be discovered by
<tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> because the error is on a remote host.
The <tt class="literal">arp</tt> command is used for this type of problem.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">13.4.2. Troubleshooting with the arp Command </h3>

<p>The <tt class="literal">arp</tt> command <a name="INDEX-2887" /> <a name="INDEX-2888" />
<a name="INDEX-2889" />
<a name="INDEX-2890" /> <a name="INDEX-2891" />is used to <a name="INDEX-2892" />analyze
problems with IP-to-Ethernet address translation. The
<tt class="literal">arp</tt> command has three useful options for
troubleshooting:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">-a</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Display all ARP entries in the table.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">-d</tt> <em class="replaceable">hostname</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Delete an entry from the ARP table.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">-s</tt> <em class="replaceable">hostname ether-address</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add a new entry to the table.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>With these three options you can view the contents of the ARP table,
delete a problem entry, and install a corrected entry. The ability to
install a corrected entry is useful in "buying time"
while you look for the permanent fix.
</p>

<p>Use <tt class="literal">arp</tt> if you suspect that incorrect entries are
getting into the address resolution table. One clear indication of
problems with the ARP table is a report that the "wrong"
host responded to some command, like <tt class="literal">ftp</tt> or
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt>. Intermittent problems that affect only
certain hosts can also indicate that the ARP table has been
corrupted. ARP table problems are usually caused by two systems using
the same IP address. The problems appear intermittent because the
entry that appears in the table is the address of the host that
responded quickest to the last ARP request. Sometimes the
"correct" host responds first, and sometimes the
"wrong" host responds first.
</p>

<p>If you suspect that two systems are using the same IP address,
display the address resolution table with the <tt class="literal">arp
-a</tt> command. Here's an example from a Solaris
system:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-144">[144]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-144" /><p>[144]The format in which the ARP table is
displayed may vary slightly between systems.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">arp -a</b> 
Net to Media Table: IPv4 
Device   IP Address               Mask      Flags   Phys Addr  
------ -------------------- --------------- ----- --------------- 
dnet0  pecan                255.255.255.255       08:00:20:05:21:33 
dnet0  horseshoe            255.255.255.255       00:00:0c:e0:80:b1

dnet0  BASE-ADDRESS.MCAST.NET 240.0.0.0      SM   01:00:5e:00:00:00</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is easiest to verify that the IP and Ethernet address pairs are
correct if you have a record of each host's correct Ethernet
address. For this reason you should record each host's Ethernet
and IP address when it is added to your network. If you have such a
record, you'll quickly see if anything is wrong with the table.
</p>

<p>If you don't have this type of record, the first three bytes of
the Ethernet address can help you to detect a problem. The first
three bytes of the address identify the equipment manufacturer. A
list of these identifying prefixes is found at
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers</a>.
</p>

<p>From the vendor prefixes we see that two of the ARP entries displayed
in our example are Sun systems (8:0:20). If
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> is also supposed to be a Sun, the
0:0:0c Cisco prefix indicates that a Cisco router has been mistakenly
configured with <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>'s IP address.
</p>

<p>If neither checking a record of correct assignments nor checking the
manufacturer prefix helps you identify the source of the errant ARP,
try using <tt class="literal">telnet</tt> to connect to the IP address
shown in the ARP entry. If the device supports
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt>, the login banner might help you identify
the incorrectly configured host.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-SECT-4.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.4.2.1. ARP problem case study </h3>

<p>A user called in asking if the server was down, and reported the
following problem. The user's workstation, called
<em class="emphasis">limulus</em>, appeared to "lock up" for
minutes at a time when certain commands were used, while other
commands worked with no problems. The network commands that involved
the NIS name server all caused the lock-up problem, but some
unrelated commands also caused the problem. The user reported seeing
the error message:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> NFS getattr failed for server crab: RPC: Timed out</pre></blockquote>

<p>The server <em class="emphasis">crab</em> was providing
<em class="emphasis">limulus</em> with NIS and NFS services. The commands
that failed on <em class="emphasis">limulus</em> were commands that
required NIS service, or that were stored in the centrally maintained
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local</em> directory exported from
<em class="emphasis">crab</em>. The commands that ran correctly were
installed locally on the user's workstation. No one else
reported a problem with the server, and we were able to
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> <em class="emphasis">limulus</em> from
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> and get good responses.
</p>

<p>We had the user check the <em class="emphasis">messages</em>
file<a href="#FOOTNOTE-145">[145]</a> for recent
error messages, and she discovered this:
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-145" /><p>[145]Check <em class="emphasis">/etc/syslog.conf</em> for
the full path of the <em class="emphasis">messages</em> file. Common
locations are <em class="emphasis">/var/adm/messages</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/var/log/messages</em>.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Mar  6 13:38:23 limulus vmunix: duplicate IP address!!
      sent from ethernet address: 0:0:c0:4:38:1a</pre></blockquote>

<p>This message indicates that the workstation detected another host on
the Ethernet responding to its IP address. The "imposter"
used the Ethernet address 0:0:c0:4:38:1a in its ARP response. The
correct Ethernet address for <em class="emphasis">limulus</em> is
8:0:20:e:12:37. 
</p>

<p>We checked <em class="emphasis">crab</em>'s ARP table and found that
it had the incorrect ARP entry for <em class="emphasis">limulus</em>. We
deleted the bad <em class="emphasis">limulus</em> entry with the
<tt class="literal">arp -d</tt> command, and installed the correct entry
with the <tt class="literal">-s</tt> option, as shown below:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">arp -d limulus</b> 
limulus (172.16.180.130) deleted
# <b class="emphasis-bold">arp -s limulus 8:0:20:e:12:37</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>ARP entries received via the ARP protocol are temporary. The values
are held in the table for a finite lifetime and are deleted when that
lifetime expires. New values are then obtained via the ARP protocol.
Therefore, if some remote interfaces change, the local table adjusts
and communications continue. Usually this is a good idea, but if
someone is using the wrong IP address, that bad address can keep
reappearing in the ARP table even if it is deleted. However, manually
entered values are permanent; they stay in the table and can only be
deleted manually. This allowed us to install a correct entry in the
table without worrying about it being overwritten by a bad address.
</p>

<p>This quick fix resolved <em class="emphasis">limulus</em>'s
immediate problem, but we still needed to find the culprit. We
checked the <em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em> file to see if we had an
entry for Ethernet address 0:0:c0:4:38:1a, but we didn't. From
the first three bytes of this address, 0:0:c0, we knew that the
device was a Western Digital card. Since our network has only Unix
workstations and PCs, we assumed the Western Digital card was
installed in a PC. We also guessed that the problem address was
recently installed because the user had never had the problem before.
We sent out an urgent announcement to all users asking if anyone had
recently installed a new PC, reconfigured a PC, or installed TCP/IP
software on a PC. We got one response. When we checked his system, we
found out that he had entered the address 172.16.180.130 when he
should have entered 172.16.180.138. The address was corrected and the
problem did not recur.
</p>

<p>Nothing fancy was needed to solve this problem. Once we checked the
error messages, we knew what the problem was and how to solve it.
Involving the entire network user community allowed us to quickly
locate the problem system and to avoid a room-to-room search for the
PC. Reluctance to involve users and make them part of the solution is
one of the costliest, and most common, mistakes <a name="INDEX-2893" />made by
<a name="INDEX-2894" />
<a name="INDEX-2895" />
<a name="INDEX-2896" />

<h3 class="sect2">13.4.3. Checking the Interface with netstat </h3>

<p>If the preliminary
<a name="INDEX-2899" />
<a name="INDEX-2900" />
<a name="INDEX-2901" />tests lead you to suspect that the
connection to the local area network is unreliable, the
<tt class="literal">netstat -i</tt> command can provide useful information.
The example below shows the output from the <tt class="literal">netstat
-i</tt> command on a Solaris 8 system:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-146">[146]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-146" /><p>[146]The
output on a Linux system is formatted differently, but the same
statistics are provided.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">netstat -i</b> 
Name  Mtu  Net/Dest         Address   Ipkts Ierrs Opkts Oerrs Collis Queue 
dnet0 1500 wrotethebook.com crab      442697  2   633424  2   50679  0
lo0   1536 loopback         localhost 53040   0   53040   0   0      0</pre></blockquote>

<p>The line for the loopback interface, lo0, can be ignored. Only the
line for the real network interface is significant, and only the last
five fields on that line provide significant troubleshooting
information.
</p>

<p>Let's look at the last field first. There should be no packets
queued (Queue) that cannot be transmitted. If the interface is up and
running, and the system cannot deliver packets to the network,
suspect a bad drop cable or a bad interface. Replace the cable and
see if the problem goes away. If it doesn't, call the vendor
for interface hardware repairs.
</p>

<p>The input errors (Ierrs) and the output errors (Oerrs) should be
close to 0. Regardless of how much traffic has passed through this
interface, 100 errors in either of these fields is high. High output
errors could indicate a saturated local network or a bad physical
connection between the host and the network. High input errors could
indicate that the network is saturated, the local host is overloaded,
or there is a physical network problem. Tools, such as
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> statistics or a cable tester, can help you
determine if it is a physical network problem. Evaluating the
collision rate can help you determine if the local Ethernet is
saturated.
</p>

<p>A high value in the collision field (Collis) is normal, but if the
percentage of output packets that result in a collision is too high,
it indicates that the network is saturated. Collision rates greater
than 5% bear watching. If high collision rates are seen consistently,
and are seen among a broad sampling of systems on the network, you
may need to subdivide the network to reduce traffic load.
</p>

<p>Collision rates are a percentage of output packets. Don't use
the total number of packets sent and received; use the values in the
Opkts and Collis fields when determining the collision rate. For
example, the output in the <tt class="literal">netstat</tt> example shows
50679 collisions out of 633424 outgoing packets. That's a
collision rate of 8%. This sample network could be overworked; check
the statistics on other hosts on this network. If the other systems
also show a high collision rate, consider subdividing this network.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.4. Subdividing an Ethernet </h3>

<p>To reduce the
<a name="INDEX-2902" />
<a name="INDEX-2903" /> <a name="INDEX-2904" />collision rate, you must
reduce the amount of traffic on the network segment. A simple way to
do this is to create multiple segments out of the single segment.
Each new segment will have fewer hosts and, therefore, less traffic.
We'll see, however, that it's not quite this simple.
</p>

<p>The most effective way to subdivide an Ethernet is to install an
Ethernet switch. Each port on the switch is essentially a separate
Ethernet. So a 16-port switch gives you 16 Ethernets to work with
when balancing the load. On most switches the ports can be used in a
variety of ways (see <a href="ch13_04.html#tcp3-CHP-13-FIG-1">Figure 13-1</a>). Lightly used
systems can be attached to a hub that is then attached to one of the
switch ports to allow the systems to share a single segment. Servers
and demanding systems can be given dedicated ports so that they
don't need to share a segment with anyone. Most switches
provide both 10 Mbps Ethernet and Fast Ethernet 100 Mbps ports. These
are called <em class="emphasis">asymmetric</em>
<em class="emphasis">switches</em> because different ports operate at
different speeds. Use the Fast Ethernet ports to connect heavily used
servers or segments. Most 10/100 switches have auto-sensing ports.
This allows every port to be used at either 100 Mbps or at 10 Mbps,
which gives you the maximum configuration flexibility.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2905" />Gigabit Ethernet switches can also be
used, but they have a unique place in the network topology. 10/100
switches connect servers and local networks. Gigabit switches are
primarily used to create a "collapsed backbone" to
interconnect other switches. Gigabit switches are used when designing
a new corporate backbone network. 10/100 switches are used when
subdividing an individual Ethernet segment.
</p>

<p><a href="ch13_04.html#tcp3-CHP-13-FIG-1">Figure 13-1</a> shows an 8-port 10/100 Ethernet switch.
Ports 1 and 2 are wired to Ethernet hubs. A few systems are connected
to each hub. When new systems are added they are distributed evenly
among the hubs to prevent any one segment from becoming overloaded.
Additional hubs can be added to the available switch ports for future
expansion. Port 4 attaches a demanding system with its own private
segment. Port 6 operates at 100 Mbps and attaches a heavily used
server. A port can be reserved for a future 100 Mbps connection to a
second 10/100 Ethernet switch for even more expansion.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="313" alt="Figure 13-1" src="figs/tcp3_1301.gif" width="424" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 13-1. Subdividing an Ethernet with switches</h4>

<p>Before allocating the ports on your switch, evaluate what services
are in demand, and who talks to whom. Then develop a plan that
reduces the amount of traffic flowing over any segment. For example,
if the demanding system on Port 4 uses lots of bandwidth because it
is constantly talking to one of the systems on Port 1, all of the
systems on Port 1 will suffer because of this traffic. The computer
that the demanding system communicates with should be moved to one of
the vacant ports or to the same port (4) as the demanding system. Use
your switch to the greatest advantage by balancing the load.
</p>

<p>Should you segment an old coaxial cable Ethernet by cutting the cable
and joining it back together through a router or a bridge? No. If you
have an old network that is finally reaching saturation, it is time
to install a new network built on a more robust technology. A
<em class="emphasis">shared media</em><a name="INDEX-2906" /> network, a network where everyone is
on the same cable (in this example, a coaxial cable Ethernet) is an
accident waiting to happen. Design a network that a user cannot bring
down by merely disconnecting his system, or even by accidentally
cutting a wire in his office. Use unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
cable, ideally Category 5 cable, to create a 10BaseT Ethernet or
100BaseT Fast Ethernet that wires equipment located in the
user's office to a hub securely stored in a wire closet. The
network components in the user's office should be sufficiently
isolated from the network so that damage to those components does not
damage the entire network. The new network will solve your collision
problem and reduce the amount of hardware troubleshooting you are
called upon to do.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-SECT-4.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.5. Network Hardware Problems </h3>

<p>Some of the tests discussed in this section can show a network
hardware problem. If a hardware problem is indicated, contact the
people responsible for the hardware. If the problem appears to be in
a leased telephone line, contact the telephone company. If the
problem appears to be in a wide area network, contact the management
of that network. Don't sit on a problem expecting it to go
away. It could easily get worse.
</p>

<p>If the problem is in your local area network, you will have to handle
it yourself. Some tools, such as the cable tester, can help. But
frequently the only way to approach a hardware problem is by brute
force -- disconnecting pieces of hardware until you find the one
causing the problem. It is most convenient to do this at the switch
or hub. If you identify a device causing the problem, repair or
replace it. Remember that the problem can be the cable itself, rather
than any particular device.
