<h2 class="sect1">B.10. Control Statements</h2>

<p>The control <a name="INDEX-3397" />
<a name="INDEX-3398" />statements define your routing
policy. Often when administrators hear the terms "routing
policy" or "policy-based routing," they assume that
this is something done inside the routing protocol.
</p>

<p>In reality, a routing policy is defined outside of the routing
protocol in the configuration file. The policy defines what routes
are accepted and what routes are advertised. <tt class="literal">gated</tt>
does this with two control statements: <tt class="literal">import</tt> and
<tt class="literal">export</tt>. The <tt class="literal">import</tt> statement
defines which routes are accepted and from what sources those routes
are accepted. The <tt class="literal">export</tt> statement defines which
routes are advertised based on the source of the routes and the
protocol used to advertise them.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">import</tt><a name="INDEX-3399" />
<a name="INDEX-3400" /> <a name="INDEX-3401" />
<a name="INDEX-3402" /> and <tt class="literal">export</tt>
statements use <tt class="literal">gated</tt> preference, routing metrics,
routing filters, and AS paths to define routing policy. Preference
and metrics are controlled by these keywords:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">restrict</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies that the routes are not to be imported, in the case of the
<tt class="literal">import</tt> command, or exported in the case of the
<tt class="literal">export</tt> command. This keyword blocks the use of a
specific route.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">preference</tt> <em class="replaceable">preference</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the preference value used when comparing this route to other
routes. Preference is used when installing routes, not when
advertising them.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">metric</tt> <em class="replaceable">metric</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the metric used when advertising a route. </p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Route <a name="INDEX-3403" />
<a name="INDEX-3404" />filters match routes by destination
address. Among other places, route filters are used on martians and
<tt class="literal">import</tt> and <tt class="literal">export</tt> statements. A
route matches the most specific filter that applies. Specifying more
than one filter with the same destination, mask, and modifiers
generates an error. Import and export route filters can be specified
in the following ways:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-157">[157]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-157" /><p>[157]Route filters may include
additional parameters. On <tt class="literal">import</tt> statements, they
include a preference, and on <tt class="literal">export</tt> statements, a
metric. <em class="emphasis">Preference</em> and
<em class="emphasis">metric</em> were described previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="replaceable">address</em> <tt class="literal">[mask</tt> <em class="replaceable">mask</em> <tt class="literal">| masklen</tt> <em class="replaceable">number</em><tt class="literal">] [exact | refines | between</tt> <em class="replaceable">n1</em> <tt class="literal">and</tt> <em class="replaceable">n2</em><tt class="literal">]</tt></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines a range of addresses using an address and an address mask.
The address mask can be defined with the keyword
<tt class="literal">mask</tt> and a mask written in dotted decimal
notation, or with the keyword <tt class="literal">masklen</tt> and a
numeric prefix length. If no mask is defined, the natural mask of the
network is used. Three options can be used:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">exact</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a network, but no subnets or hosts of that network. </p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">refines</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches subnets and/or hosts of a network, but not the network itself.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">between</tt> <em class="replaceable">n1</em> <tt class="literal">and</tt> <em class="replaceable">n2</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an address where at least <em class="replaceable">n1</em> bits
match and no more than <em class="replaceable">n2</em> bits match.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">all</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches every possible address.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">default</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches only the default route.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">host</tt> <em class="replaceable">address</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an individual host address. </p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>A routing filter that matches everything on network number
192.168.12.0 and the individual host 10.104.19.12 contains:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">192.168.12.0 masklen 24 ; host 10.104.19.12 ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>When no route filtering is specified in an <tt class="literal">import</tt>
or <tt class="literal">export</tt> statement, all routes from the specified
source will match that statement. If any filters are specified, only
routes that match the specified filters are imported or exported.
</p>

<p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is designed to support policy-based
routing. A key feature of BGP is that it is a path-vector protocol.
<tt class="literal">import</tt> and <tt class="literal">export</tt> statements
allow you to use the AS path vector to enforce your routing policy.
</p>

<p>An <a name="INDEX-3405" />
<a name="INDEX-3406" />AS path lists the autonomous systems
end-to-end for a route and provides an indication of the completeness
of the path. Each autonomous system that a route passes through
prepends its AS number to the beginning of the AS path.
</p>

<p>The "origin" of the path indicates its completeness. An
origin of <tt class="literal">igp</tt> indicates the route was learned from
an interior routing protocol and is most likely complete. An origin
of <tt class="literal">egp</tt> indicates the route was learned from an
exterior routing protocol that does not support AS paths (EGP for
example) and the path is most likely not complete.
</p>

<p>When the path information is definitely not complete, an origin of
<tt class="literal">incomplete</tt> is used. All of these origins can be
specified in the <tt class="literal">import</tt> and
<tt class="literal">export</tt> statements and therefore used in your
routing policy. The keyword <tt class="literal">any</tt> is used when the
policy applies to all origins.
</p>

<p>The AS path can also be used in the control statements by defining an
AS path regular expression.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-158">[158]</a> The AS path
regular expression provides a pattern-matching syntax used to filter
routes based on the autonomous system numbers in the AS paths
associated with those routes.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-158" /><p>[158]AS path regular
expressions are defined in RFC 1164. </p> </blockquote>

<p>An AS path regular expression is a regular expression composed of
autonomous system numbers and special operators. <a href="appb_10.html#tcp3-APP-B-TABLE-1">Table B-1</a> lists the AS path operators. The AS path
operator operates on an AS path term, which is an autonomous system
number; a dot (.), which matches any autonomous system number; or a
parentheses-enclosed subexpression.

<p>A simple AS path regular expression might be:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">import proto bgp aspath 164+ origin any restrict ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>This restricts all routes that have one or more occurrences of
autonomous system number 164 in their path vector.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-APP-B-SECT-10.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">B.10.1. The import Statement</h3>

<p>The format of an <a name="INDEX-3407" />
<a name="INDEX-3408" /><tt class="literal">import</tt> statement
varies depending on the source protocol. The format of the
<tt class="literal">import</tt> statements for the exterior gateway
protocols is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">import proto bgp | egp autonomoussystem <em class="replaceable">as_number</em>
   [restrict] |
   [[preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>] {
   <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | (preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>)]] ; } ;
import proto bgp aspath <em class="replaceable">aspath_regexp</em>
   origin any | igp | egp | incomplete
   [restrict] |
   [[preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>] {
   <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | (preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>)]] ; } ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>BGP and EGP importation may be controlled by autonomous system
number. BGP also can control importation using AS path regular
expressions. Routes that are rejected by the routing policy are
stored in the routing table with a negative preference. A negative
preference prevents a route from being installed in the forwarding
table or exported to other protocols. Handling rejected routes in
this manner alleviates the need to break and reestablish a session if
routing policy changes during a reconfiguration.
</p>

<p>The format of the <tt class="literal">import</tt> statements for the RIP
and redirect protocols is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">import proto rip | redirect
 [interface <em class="replaceable">interface_list</em> | gateway <em class="replaceable">gateway_list</em>]
 [restrict] |
 [[preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | (preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>)]] ; } ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>This statement controls what routes are imported based on the source
protocol, interface, and gateway. The order of precedence is from the
most general (protocol) to the most specific (gateway). Unlike BGP
and EGP, these protocols do not save routes that were rejected
because these protocols have short update intervals.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">preference</tt> option is not used with RIP. RIP
doesn't use preference to choose between routes of the same
protocol. It uses the protocol metrics.
</p>

<p>The format of the <tt class="literal">import</tt> statement for the OSPF
protocol is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">import proto ospfase [tag <em class="replaceable">ospf_tag</em>] [restrict] |
 [[preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | (preference <em class="replaceable">preference</em>)]] ; } ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Due to the nature of OSPF, only the importation of ASE routes can be
controlled. Furthermore, it is only possible to restrict the
importation of OSPF ASE routes when functioning as an AS border
router. This requires you to specify an <tt class="literal">export
ospfase</tt> statement in addition to the
<tt class="literal">import</tt> <tt class="literal">ospfase</tt> statement.
Specify an empty <tt class="literal">export</tt> statement to control
importation of ASEs when no ASEs are being exported. (See the
following section, "The export Statement.") If a tag is
specified, the <tt class="literal">import</tt> statement applies only to
routes with the tag. OSPF ASE routes that are rejected by policy are
stored in the table with a negative preference.
</p>

<p>OSPF routes are imported into the <tt class="literal">gated</tt> routing
table with a preference of 10. Preference is not used to choose
between OSPF ASE routes. OSPF costs are used for that purpose.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-APP-B-SECT-10.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">B.10.2. The export Statement</h3>

<p>The syntax of the <a name="INDEX-3409" /> <a name="INDEX-3410" /><tt class="literal">export</tt> statement
is similar to the syntax of the <tt class="literal">import</tt> statement,
and the meanings of many of the parameters are identical. An
important difference between the two statements is that while route
importation is controlled by source information, route exportation is
controlled by both source and destination. Thus,
<tt class="literal">export</tt> statements define where the routes will be
sent and where they originated. The destination of the route
advertisement is defined by the <tt class="literal">proto</tt> clause at
the beginning of the <tt class="literal">export</tt> statement. The source
of the routes is defined in the export list.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">export</tt> statement varies slightly for each
protocol. To advertise routes via EGP and BGP, use this syntax:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">export proto bgp | egp as <em class="replaceable">as_number</em>
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">export_list</em> ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Routes are exported via EGP and BGP to the specified autonomous
system. <tt class="literal">restrict</tt> blocks exports to the AS. Valid
BGP or EGP metrics can be specified. If no export list is defined,
only the direct routes of the attached interfaces are exported. If an
export list is used, it must explicitly specify everything that
should be exported.
</p>

<p>To advertise routes via RIP, use this syntax:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">export proto rip
  [interface <em class="replaceable">interface_list</em> | gateway <em class="replaceable">gateway_list</em>]
  [restrict] |
  [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">export_list</em> ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Routes exported by RIP can be sent through a specific interface or to
a specific gateway. Set <em class="replaceable">metric</em> if you plan
to export static or internally generated default routes. The
<tt class="literal">metric</tt> option is used only when exporting non-RIP
routes via RIP.
</p>

<p>If no export list is specified, RIP exports direct routes and RIP
routes. If an export list is used, it must explicitly specify
everything that should be exported.
</p>

<p>To advertise routes via OSPF, use this syntax:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">export proto osfpase [type 1 | 2] [tag <em class="replaceable">ospf_tag</em>]
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">export_list</em> ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Only OSPF ASE routes can be exported by <tt class="literal">gated</tt>.
There are two types of OSPF ASE routes, type 1 and type 2. They are
described in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Configuring Routing "</a> and earlier in this
appendix. The default type is specified in the <tt class="literal">ospf
protocol</tt> statement, but it can be overridden here. The
<em class="replaceable">ospf_tag</em> is an arbitrary 32-bit number
used to filter routing information. The default tag value is
specified in the <tt class="literal">ospf protocol</tt> statement, but it
can be overridden here.
</p>

<p>The source of the routes advertised by a protocol is defined by the
export list. Each of the commands listed above contains an export
list option. Just like those commands, the export list syntax varies
depending on the source protocol of the routes. The commands
described above define the protocols that are used to advertise the
routes. The export lists shown below describe the protocols from
which the routes are obtained. The biggest confusion caused by the
export list syntax is that it is almost identical to the syntax shown
above. In both cases we define protocols, autonomous systems,
interfaces, gateways, and so on. In the first case we are defining
the protocols, interfaces, etc., to which routes are sent, and in
this case we are defining the protocols, interfaces, etc., from which
routes are received.
</p>

<p>To export routes learned from BGP and EGP, use this export list
syntax:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">export proto bgp | egp autonomoussystem <em class="replaceable">as_number</em>
 [restrict [noagg]] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>This defines routes learned via BGP or EGP from a specific autonomous
system. Routes can be restricted, or have a metric applied, based on
matching the source AS number or the route filter.
<tt class="literal">noagg</tt> can be used with <tt class="literal">restrict</tt>
to prevent any aggregate routes from matching the filter.
</p>

<p>When BGP is configured, <tt class="literal">gated</tt> assigns all routes
an AS path. For interior routes, the AS path specifies
<tt class="literal">igp</tt> as the origin and no autonomous systems in the
AS path (the current AS is added when the route is exported). For EGP
routes, the AS path specifies <tt class="literal">egp</tt> as the origin
and the source AS as the AS path. For BGP routes, the AS path learned
from BGP is used. If you run BGP, the export of all routes may be
controlled by the AS path using this syntax:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto <em class="replaceable">proto</em> | all
 aspath <em class="replaceable">aspath_regexp</em> origin any | igp | egp | incomplete
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The source of the routes can be any one protocol
(<em class="replaceable">proto</em>) or all protocols
(<tt class="literal">all</tt>). The importation of routes can be controlled
by matching their AS paths against the AS path regular expression
(<em class="replaceable">aspath_regexp</em>) or by matching their
addresses against the <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em>. Route
filters and AS path regular expressions were explained previously.
</p>

<p>To export routes learned from RIP, use this export list syntax:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto rip
 [interface <em class="replaceable">interface_list</em> | gateway <em class="replaceable">gateway_list</em>]
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The export of RIP routes may be controlled by source interface,
source gateway, or route filter.
</p>

<p>To export routes learned from OSPF, use this export list syntax:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto ospf | ospfase
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The export of OSPF and OSPF ASE routes may be controlled by protocol
and route filter. Exporting OSPF routes can also be controlled by
<em class="replaceable">tag</em> using the following syntax:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto proto | all tag <em class="replaceable">tag</em>
 <em class="replaceable"> </em> [restrict] |
   [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
   <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>OSPF and RIP version 2 provide a tag field. For all other protocols,
the tag is always 0. Routes may be selected based on the contents of
the tag field.
</p>

<p>There are other sources of routes that are not true routing
protocols, and export lists can be defined for these sources. The two
export lists for these sources are:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto direct | static | kernel
 [interface <em class="replaceable">interface_list</em>]
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The export of these routes can be controlled based on the source
"protocol" and the source interface. The
"protocols" in this case are routes to direct interfaces,
static routes, or routes learned from the kernel.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">proto default | aggregate
 [restrict] |
 [[metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] {
  <em class="replaceable">route_filter</em> [restrict | metric <em class="replaceable">metric</em>] ; }] ;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The export of these routes may only be controlled based on source
"protocol." <tt class="literal">default</tt> refers to routes
created by the <tt class="literal">gendefault</tt> option.
<tt class="literal">aggregate</tt> refers to routes created by the
aggregate statements, the topic of the next <a name="INDEX-3411" /> <a name="INDEX-3412" />section.
