<h2 class="sect1">3.6. Configuration Servers</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-751" />
<a name="INDEX-752" />
<a name="INDEX-753" />The powerful features that add to the
utility and flexibility of TCP/IP also add to its complexity. TCP/IP
is not as easy to configure as some other networking systems. TCP/IP
requires that the configuration provide hardware, addressing, and
routing information. It is designed to be independent of any specific
underlying network hardware, so configuration information that can be
built into the hardware in some network systems cannot be built in
for TCP/IP. The information must be provided by the person
responsible for the configuration. This assumes that every system is
run by people who are knowledgeable enough to provide the proper
information to configure the system. Unfortunately, this assumption
does not always prove correct.
</p>

<p>Configuration servers make it possible for the network administrator
to control TCP/IP configuration from a central point. This relieves
the end user of some of the burden of configuration and improves the
quality of the information used to configure systems.
</p>

<p>TCP/IP has used three protocols to simplify the task of
configuration: RARP, BOOTP, and DHCP. We begin with RARP, the oldest
and most basic of these configuration tools.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.6.1. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-754" />RARP, <a name="INDEX-755" />defined
<a name="INDEX-756" />
<a name="INDEX-757" />
<a name="INDEX-758" />in RFC 903,
is a protocol that converts a physical network address into an IP
address, which is the reverse of what Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) does. A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol server maps a
physical address to an IP address for a client that doesn't
know its own IP address. The client sends out a broadcast using the
broadcast services of the physical network.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-30">[30]</a> The broadcast packet contains the client's physical
network address and asks if any system on the network knows what IP
address is associated with the address. The RARP server responds with
a packet that contains the client's IP address.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-30" /><p>[30]Like ARP,
RARP is a Network Access Layer protocol that uses physical network
services residing below the Internet Layer. See the discussion of
TCP/IP protocol layers in <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "
Overview of TCP/IP"</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The client knows its physical network address because it is encoded
in the Ethernet interface hardware. On most systems, you can easily
check the value with a command. For example, on a Solaris 8 system,
the superuser
<a name="INDEX-759" />can type:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">ifconfig dnet0</b>
dnet0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 2
        inet 172.16.12.1 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 172.16.12.255
        ether 0:0:c0:dd:d4:da</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> command <a name="INDEX-760" />can set or display the configuration
values for a network interface.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-31">[31]</a>
<em class="emphasis">dnet0</em> is the device name of the Ethernet
interface. The Ethernet address is displayed after the
<em class="emphasis">ether</em> label. In the example, the address is
0:0:c0:dd:d4:da. 
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-31" /><p>[31] See <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring the Interface "</a> for information about the
<tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> command.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The RARP server looks up the IP address that it uses in its response
to the client in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em>
file.<a name="INDEX-761" /> The
<em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em> file contains the client's
Ethernet address followed by the client's hostname. For
example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">2:60:8c:48:84:49        clock 
0:0:c0:a1:5e:10         ring 
0:80:c7:aa:a8:04        24seven 
8:0:5a:1d:c0:7e         limulus 
8:0:69:4:6:31           arthropod</pre></blockquote>

<p>To respond to a RARP request, the server must also resolve the
hostname found in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em> file into an
IP address. DNS or the <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file is used for
this task. The following <em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file entries
could be used with the <em class="emphasis">ethers</em> file shown above:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">clock           172.16.3.10 
ring            172.16.3.16 
24seven         172.16.3.4 
limulus         172.16.3.7
arthropod       172.16.3.21</pre></blockquote>

<p>Given these sample files, if the server receives a RARP request that
contains the Ethernet address 0:80:c7:aa:a8:04, it matches it to
<em class="emphasis">24seven</em> in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/ethers</em>
file. The server uses the name <em class="emphasis">24seven</em> to look
up the IP address. It then sends the IP address 172.16.3.4 out as its
ARP response.
</p>

<p>RARP is a useful tool, but it provides only the IP address. There are
still several other values that need to be manually configured.
Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a more flexible configuration tool that
provides more values than just the IP address and can deliver those
values via the network.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-762" />BOOTP is defined in RFCs 951 and 1532.
The RFCs describe BOOTP as an alternative to RARP; when BOOTP is
used, RARP is not needed. BOOTP, however, is a more comprehensive
configuration protocol than RARP. It provides much more configuration
information and has the potential to offer still more. The original
specification allowed vendor extensions as a vehicle for the
protocol's evolution. RFC 1048 first formalized the definition
of these extensions, which have been updated over time and are
currently defined in RFC 2132. BOOTP and its extensions became the
basis for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP has
superseded BOOTP, so DHCP is the configuration protocol that you will
use on your network.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.6.2. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-763" />Dynamic
<a name="INDEX-764" />Host
<a name="INDEX-765" />
<a name="INDEX-766" />
<a name="INDEX-767" />Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) is defined in RFCs 2131 and 2132. It's designed
to be compatible with BOOTP. RFC 1534 outlines interactions between
BOOTP clients and DHCP servers and between DHCP clients and BOOTP
servers. DHCP is the correct configuration protocol for your network
because DHCP exceeds the capabilities of BOOTP while maintaining
support for existing BOOTP clients.
</p>

<p>DHCP uses the same UDP ports as BOOTP (67 and 68) and the same
<em class="emphasis">basic</em> packet format. But DHCP is more than just
an update of BOOTP. The new protocol expands the function of
<a name="INDEX-768" />BOOTP in
two areas:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The configuration parameters provided by a DHCP server include
everything defined in the <em class="emphasis">Requirements for Internet
Hosts</em> RFC. DHCP provides a client with a complete set of
TCP/IP configuration values.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>DHCP permits automated allocation of IP addresses.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>DHCP expands the original BOOTP packet in order to indicate the DHCP
packet type and to carry a complete set of configuration information.
DHCP calls the values in this part of the packet
<em class="emphasis">options</em>. To handle the full set of configuration
values from the <em class="emphasis">Requirements for Internet Hosts</em>
RFC, the Options field is <a name="INDEX-769" />large and has a variable format.
</p>

<p>You don't usually need to use the full set of configuration
values. Don't get me wrong; it's not that the values are
unnecessary -- all the parameters are needed for a complete TCP/IP
configuration. It's just that you don't need to
<em class="emphasis">define</em> values for them. Default values are
provided in most TCP/IP implementations, and the defaults need to be
changed only in special circumstances. The expanded configuration
parameters of DHCP make it a more complete protocol than BOOTP, but
they are not the most useful features of DHCP.
</p>

<p>For most network administrators, automatic allocation of IP addresses
is a more interesting feature. DHCP allows addresses to be assigned
in <a name="INDEX-770" />four ways:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Permanent fixed addresses</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>As always, <a name="INDEX-771" />the
administrator can continue to assign addresses without using the DHCP
system. While this happens completely outside of DHCP, DHCP makes
allowances for it by permitting addresses to be excluded from the
range of addresses under the control of the DHCP server. Most
networks have some permanently assigned addresses.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Manual allocation</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The network <a name="INDEX-772" />administrator keeps complete control over
addresses by specifically assigning them to clients in the DHCP
configuration. This is exactly the same way that addresses are
handled under BOOTP. Manual allocation fails to take full advantage
of the power of DHCP but might be needed if you have BOOTP clients.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Automatic allocation</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-773" />The DHCP server permanently assigns an
address from a pool of addresses. The administrator is not involved
in the details of assigning a client an address. This technique fails
to take advantage of the DHCP server's ability to collect and
reuse addresses.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Dynamic allocation</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-774" />The server assigns an address to a
DHCP client for a limited period of time. The limited life of the
address is called a <em class="emphasis">lease</em>.
<a name="INDEX-775" />The client can
return the address to the server at any time but must request an
extension from the server to retain the address longer than the time
permitted. The server automatically reclaims the address after the
lease expires if the client has not requested an extension. Dynamic
allocation uses the full power of DHCP.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Dynamic allocation is useful in any network, particularly a large
distributed network where many systems are being added and deleted.
Unused addresses are returned to the pool of addresses without
relying on users or system administrators to deliberately return
them. Addresses are used only when and where they're needed.
Dynamic allocation allows a network to make the maximum use of a
limited set of addresses. It is particularly well suited to mobile
systems <a name="INDEX-776" />that move from subnet to subnet and
therefore must be constantly reassigned addresses appropriate for
their current network location. Even in the smallest network, dynamic
allocation simplifies the network administrator's job.
</p>

<p>Dynamic address allocation does not work for every system. Name
servers, email servers, login hosts, and other shared systems are
always online, and they are not mobile. These systems are accessed by
name, so a shared system's domain name must resolve to the
correct address. Shared systems are manually allocated permanent,
fixed addresses.
</p>

<p>Dynamic address assignment has major repercussions for DNS. DNS is
required to map hostnames to IP addresses. It cannot perform this job
if IP addresses are constantly changing and DNS is not informed of
the changes. To make dynamic address assignment work for all types of
systems, we need a DNS that can be dynamically updated by the DHCP
server. <em class="emphasis">Dynamic DNS</em><a name="INDEX-777" /> <a name="INDEX-778" /> (DDNS) is available, but it is not yet
widely used.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-32">[32]</a> When fully deployed,
it will help make dynamic addresses available to systems that provide
services and to those that use them.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-32" /><p>[32]See <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a> for
more information about DDNS.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Given the nature of dynamic addressing, most sites assign permanent
fixed addresses to shared servers. This happens through traditional
system administration and is not handled by DHCP. In effect, the
administrator of the shared server is given an address and puts that
address in the shared server's configuration. Using DHCP for
some systems doesn't mean it must be used for all systems.
</p>

<p>DHCP servers can support BOOTP clients. However, a DHCP client is
needed to take full advantage of the services offered by DHCP. BOOTP
clients do not understand dynamic address leases. They do not know
that an address can time out
<a name="INDEX-779" />and that it must be renewed. BOOTP clients
must be manually or automatically assigned permanent addresses. True
dynamic address assignment is limited to DHCP clients.
</p>

<p>Therefore, most sites that use DHCP have a mixture of: </p>

<ul><li>
<p>Permanent addresses assigned to systems that can't use DHCP</p>
</li><li>
<p>Manual addresses assigned to BOOTP clients</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dynamic addresses assigned to all DHCP clients</p>
</li></ul>
<p>All of this begs the question of how a client that doesn't know
its own address can communicate with a server. DHCP defines a simple
packet exchange that allows the client to find a server and obtain a
configuration.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-6.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.6.2.1. How DHCP works</h3>

<p>The DHCP <a name="INDEX-780" />client broadcasts a packet called a
<em class="emphasis">DHCPDISCOVER</em><a name="INDEX-781" />
<a name="INDEX-782" />
message that contains, at a minimum, a transaction identifier and the
client's DHCP identifier, which is normally the client's
physical network address. The client sends the broadcast using the
address 255.255.255.255, which is a special address called the
<em class="emphasis">limited</em>
<a name="INDEX-783" /> <a name="INDEX-784" /><em class="emphasis">broadcast
address</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-33">[33]</a> The client waits for a response from the server. If a
response is not received within a specified time interval, the client
retransmits the request. DHCP uses UDP as a transport protocol and,
unlike RARP, does not require any special Network Access Layer
protocols.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-33" /><p>[33]This address is useful because,
unlike the normal broadcast address, it doesn't require the
system to know the address of the network it is on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The server responds to the client's message with a
<em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em><a name="INDEX-785" />
<a name="INDEX-786" />
packet. DHCP uses two different well-known port numbers. UDP port
<a name="INDEX-787" />number
67 is used for the server, and UDP port number 68 is used for the
client. This is very unusual. Most software uses a well-known port on
the server side and a randomly generated port on the client side.
(How and why random source port numbers are used is described in
Chapter 1.) The random port number ensures that each pair of
source/destination ports identifies a unique path for exchanging
information. A DHCP client, however, is still in the process of
booting. It probably does not know its IP address. Even if the client
generates a source port for the <em class="emphasis">DHCPDISCOVER</em>
packet, a server response that is addressed to that port and the
client's IP address won't be read by a client that
doesn't recognize the address. Therefore, DHCP sends the
response to a specific port on all hosts. A broadcast sent to UDP
port 68 is read by all hosts, even by a system that doesn't
know its specific address. The system then determines if it is the
intended recipient by checking the transaction identifier and the
physical network address embedded in the response.
</p>

<p>The server fills in the <em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em> packet with
the configuration data it has for the client. A DHCP server can
provide every TCP/IP configuration value a client needs, provided the
server is properly configured. <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Local Network Services"</a> is a
tutorial on setting up a DHCP server, and <a href="appd_01.html">Appendix D, "A dhcpd Reference"</a> is a complete list of all of the DHCP
configuration parameters.
</p>

<p>As the name implies, the <em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em> packet is an
<em class="emphasis">offer</em> of configuration data. That offer has a
limited lifetime -- typically 120 seconds. The client must respond
to the offer before the lifetime expires. This is done because more
than one server may hear the <em class="emphasis">DHCPDISCOVER</em> packet
from the client and respond with a <em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em>. If
the servers did not require a response from the client, multiple
servers might commit resources to a single client, thus wasting
resources that could be used by other clients. If a client receives
multiple <em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em> packets, it responds to only
one and ignores the others.
</p>

<p>The client responds to the <em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em> with a
<em class="emphasis">DHCPREQUEST</em> message. The
<em class="emphasis">DHCPREQUEST</em> message asks the server to assign
the client the configuration information that was offered. The server
checks the information in the <em class="emphasis">DHCPREQUEST</em> to
make sure that the client got everything right and that all of the
offered data is still available. If everything is correct, the server
sends the client a <em class="emphasis">DHCPACK</em> message letting the
client know that it is now configured to use all of the information
from the original <em class="emphasis">DHCPOFFER</em> packet. <a href="ch03_06.html#tcp3-CHP-3-FIG-5">Figure 3-5</a> shows the normal packet flow when DHCP is used
to configure a client.
