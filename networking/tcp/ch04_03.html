<h2 class="sect1">4.3. Planning Routing </h2>

<p>In <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>, we <a name="INDEX-903" />
<a name="INDEX-904" /> <a name="INDEX-905" />learned that hosts communicate
directly only with other computers connected to the same network.
Gateways are needed to communicate with systems on other networks. If
the hosts on your network need to communicate with computers on other
networks, a route through a gateway must be defined. There are two
ways to do this:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Routing can be handled by a <em class="emphasis">static routing
table</em><a name="INDEX-906" />
<a name="INDEX-907" /> built by
the system administrator. Static routing tables are most useful when
the number of gateways is limited. Static tables do not dynamically
adjust to changing network conditions, so each change in the table is
made manually by the network administrator. Complex environments
require a more flexible approach to routing than a static routing
table provides.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Routing can be handled by a <em class="emphasis">dynamic routing
table</em><a name="INDEX-908" /> <a name="INDEX-909" /> that
responds to changing network conditions. Dynamic routing tables are
built by routing protocols. Routing protocols exchange routing
information that is used to update the routing table. Dynamic routing
is used when there are multiple gateways on a network; it's
essential when more than one gateway can reach the same destination.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Many networks use a combination of both static and dynamic routing.
Some systems on the network use static routing tables while others
run routing protocols and have dynamic tables. While it is often
appropriate for hosts to use static routing tables, gateways usually
run routing protocols.
</p>

<p>The network administrator <a name="INDEX-910" />is responsible for deciding what type of
routing to use and for choosing the default gateway for each host.
ake these decisions before you start to configure your system.
</p>

<p>Here are a few guidelines to help you plan routing. If you have:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">A network with no gateways to other TCP/IP networks</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>No special routing configuration is required in this case. The
gateways referred to in this discussion are IP routers that
interconnect TCP/IP networks. If you are not interconnecting TCP/IP
networks, you do not need an IP router. Neither a default gateway nor
a routing protocol needs to be specified.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">A network with a single gateway</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you have only one gateway, don't run any routing protocols.
Specify the single gateway as the default gateway in a static routing
table.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">A network with internal gateways to other subnets and a single gateway to the world</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Here, there is a real choice. You can statically specify each subnet
route and make the gateway to the world your default route, or you
can run a routing protocol. Decide which you want to do based on the
effort involved in maintaining a static table versus the slight
overhead of running a routing protocol on your hosts and networks. If
you have more than a few hosts, running a routing protocol is
probably easiest.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">A network with multiple gateways to the world</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you have multiple gateways that can reach the same destination,
use a routing protocol. This allows the gateways to adapt to network
changes, giving you redundant access to the remote networks.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p><a href="ch04_03.html#tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-1">Figure 4-1</a> shows a subnetted network with five
gateways identified as <em class="emphasis">A</em> through
<em class="emphasis">E</em>. A central subnet (172.16.1.0) interconnects
five other subnets. One of the subnets has a gateway to an external
network. The network administrator would probably choose to run a
routing protocol on the central subnet (172.16.1.0) and perhaps on
subnet 172.16.12.0, which is attached to an external network. Dynamic
routing is appropriate on these subnets because they have multiple
gateways. Without dynamic routing, the administrator would need to
update every one of these gateways manually whenever any change
occurred in the network -- for example, whenever a new subnet was
added. A mistake during the manual update could disrupt network
service. Running a routing protocol on these two subnets is simpler
and more reliable.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="407" alt="Figure 4-1" src="figs/tcp3_0401.gif" width="431" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-1. Routing and subnets</h4>

<p>On the other hand, the administrator would probably choose static
routing for the other subnets (172.16.3.0, 172.16.6.0, and
172.16.9.0). These subnets each use only one gateway to reach all
destinations. Changes external to the subnets, such as the addition
of a new subnet, do not change the fact that these three subnets
still have only one routing choice. Newly added networks are still
reached through the same gateway. The hosts on these subnets specify
the subnet's gateway as their default route. In other words,
the hosts on subnet 172.16.3.0 specify <em class="emphasis">B</em> as the
default gateway, while the hosts on subnet 172.16.9.0 specify
<em class="emphasis">D</em> as the default, no matter what happens on the
external networks.
</p>

<p>Some routing decisions are thrust upon you by the external networks
to which you connect. In <a href="ch04_03.html#tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-1">Figure 4-1</a>, the local
network connects to an external network that requires that Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) be used for routing. Therefore, gateway
<em class="emphasis">E</em> has to run BGP to exchange routes with the
<a name="INDEX-911" />
<a name="INDEX-912" />
<a name="INDEX-913" />external network.

<h3 class="sect2">4.3.1. Obtaining an autonomous system number </h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-914" /> <a name="INDEX-915" />
<a name="INDEX-916" /> <a name="INDEX-917" />Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) requires that gateways have a special
identifier called <a name="INDEX-918" />an <em class="emphasis">autonomous
system number</em> (ASN).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-39">[39]</a> Most sites do not need to
run BGP. Even when a site does run BGP, it usually runs it using the
ASN of its ISP or one of the ASNs that have been set aside for
private use, which are the numbers from 64512 to 65535. Coordinate
your ASN selection with your border gateway peers to avoid any
possible conflicts. If you connect to the Internet through a single
ISP, you almost certainly do not need an official ASN. If after
discussions with your service provider you find that you
<em class="emphasis">must</em> obtain an official ASN, obtain the
application from the Regional Internet <a name="INDEX-919" />Registry that services your
country.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-39" /><p>[39]Refer to the section
<a href="ch02_03.html#tcp3-CHP-2-SECT-3">Section 2.3, "Internet Routing Architecture"</a> for a discussion
of autonomous systems.</p> </blockquote>

<ul><li>
<p>If you're in the Asia and Pacific region, served by APNIC, you
should use the application form at
<a href="http://ftp.apnic.net/apnic/docs/asn-request">http://ftp.apnic.net/apnic/docs/asn-request</a> and mail the
completed form to <em class="email">hostmaster@apnic.net</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're in the Americas, served by ARIN, you should use the
application form at
<a href="http://www.arin.net/templates/asntemplate.txt">http://www.arin.net/templates/asntemplate.txt</a>
and mail the completed form to
<em class="email">hostmaster@arin.net</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're in Europe, served by RIPE, you should use the
application form at
<a href="ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-147.txt">ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-147.txt</a> and
mail the completed form to <em class="email">hostmaster@ripe.net</em>.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you submit an application, you are asked to explain why you need a
unique autonomous system number. Unless you are an ISP, probably the
only reason to obtain an ASN is that you are a <em class="emphasis">multi-homed
site</em>. A
<a name="INDEX-920" />multi-homed site is any site that
connects to more than one ISP. Reachability information for the site
may be advertised by both ISPs, confusing the routing policy.
Assigning the site an ASN gives it direct responsibility for setting
its own routing policy and advertising its own reachability
information. This doesn't prevent the site from advertising bad
routes, but it makes the advertisement traceable back to one site and
ultimately to one technical contact. (Once you submit an ASN
application, you have no one to blame but yourself!)
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.3.2. Registering in a Routing Database</h3>

<p>If you obtain
<a name="INDEX-921" /> <a name="INDEX-922" />an official ASN, you must decide
whether you need to register in a routing database. If you got your
ASN because you're multi-homed, you should register with a
routing database. <a href="ch02_03.html#tcp3-CHP-2-SECT-3">Section 2.3, "Internet Routing Architecture"</a> explains that routing
databases are used to validate routing in the new Internet because
there is no longer a central core that can be relied on to determine
"best" routes. When you obtain an official ASN, you
become part of the structure of co-equal routing domains. You assume
responsibility for a small portion of the routing burden and you
declare that responsibility by registering in a routing database.
</p>

<p>There are several different databases that make up the
<a name="INDEX-923" /><a name="INDEX-924" />Internet Routing
Registry (IRR). In addition to the <a name="INDEX-925" /><a name="INDEX-926" />Routing Arbiter Database (RADB) mentioned
in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>, RIPE, ANS, Bell Canada, and Cable
&amp; Wireless all maintain databases. RIPE serves customers in the
RIPE region. ANS, Bell Canada, and Cable &amp; Wireless register only
their paying customers. RADB is available to anyone.
</p>

<p>To register in the RADB, first register a maintainer object.
aintainer objects identify the person who will be responsible for
maintaining your database entries. Provide the required information,
and pay the $200 fee. You must then register the autonomous system as
<a name="INDEX-927" />
an AS object. Finally, you create a Route object for each route your
system will advertise. See 
<a href="http://www.radb.net/">http://www.radb.net</a> for detailed information about
registering these database objects.
</p>

<p>All of the items discussed so far (addressing, subnetting, and
routing) are required to configure the basic physical network on top
of which the applications and services run. Now we begin planning the
services that make the network useful and usable.
