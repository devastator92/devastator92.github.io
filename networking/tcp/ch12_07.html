<h2 class="sect1">12.7. Firewalls </h2>

<p>A firewall <a name="INDEX-2823" />
<a name="INDEX-2824" />system
is an essential component of network security. The term
"firewall" implies protection from danger, and just as
the firewall in your car protects the passengers' compartment
from the car's engine, a firewall computer system protects your
network from the outside world. A firewall computer system provides
strict access control between your systems and the outside world.
</p>

<p>The concept of a firewall is quite simple. A firewall is a choke
point through which all traffic between a secured network and an
unsecured network must pass. In practice, it is usually a choke point
between an enterprise network and the Internet. Creating a single
point through which all traffic must pass allows the traffic to be
more easily monitored and controlled and allows security expertise to
be concentrated on that single point.
</p>

<p>Firewalls are implemented in many ways. In fact, there are so many
different types of firewalls, the term is almost meaningless. When
someone tells you they have a firewall, you really can't know
exactly what they mean. Covering all of the different types of
firewall architectures requires an entire book -- see
<em class="emphasis"><a href="../fire/index-2.html">Building Internet Firewalls</a></em> (O'Reilly
&amp; Associates). Here we cover the <a name="INDEX-2825" />screened subnet
architecture (probably the most popular firewall architecture) and
the multi-homed host architecture, which is essentially a
firewall-in-a-box.
</p>

<p>The most common firewall architecture contains at least four hardware
components: an exterior router, a secure server (called a
<em class="emphasis">bastion host</em>), an exposed network (called a
<em class="emphasis">perimeter network</em>), and an interior router. Each
hardware component provides part of the complete security scheme.
<a href="ch12_07.html#tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-4">Figure 12-4</a> illustrates this architecture.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-4" /><div class="figure"><img height="311" alt="Figure 12-4" src="figs/tcp3_1204.gif" width="242" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-4. Screened subnet firewall</h4>

<p>The exterior router is the only connection between the enterprise
network and the outside world. This router is configured to do a
minimal level of access control. It checks to make sure that no
packet coming from the external world has a source address that
matches the internal network. If our network number is 172.16, the
exterior router discards any packets it receives on its exterior
interface that contain the source address 172.16. That source address
should be received by the router only on its interior interface.
Security people call this type of access control <em class="emphasis">packet
filtering</em><a name="INDEX-2826" /> <a name="INDEX-2827" />
<a name="INDEX-2828" />.
</p>

<p>The interior router does the bulk of the access control work. It
filters packets not only on address but also on protocol and port
numbers to control the services that are accessible to and from the
interior network. It's up to you which services this router
blocks. If you plan to use a firewall, the services that will be
allowed and those that will be denied should be defined in your
security policy document. Almost every service can be a threat. These
threats must be evaluated in light of your security needs. Services
that are intended only for internal users (NIS, NFS, X-Windows, etc.)
are almost always blocked. Services that allow writing to internal
systems (Telnet, FTP, SMTP, etc.) are usually blocked. Services that
provide information about internal systems (DNS,
<tt class="literal">fingerd</tt>, etc.) are usually blocked. This
doesn't leave much running! That is where the bastion host and
perimeter network come in.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2829" />
<a name="INDEX-2830" />
<a name="INDEX-2831" />bastion host is a secure server. It
provides an interconnection point between the enterprise network and
the outside world for the restricted services. Some of the services
that are restricted by the interior gateway may be essential for a
useful network. Those essential services are provided through the
bastion host in a secure manner. The bastion host provides some
services directly, such as DNS, SMTP mail services, and anonymous
FTP. Other services are provided as <em class="emphasis">proxy
services</em>. When the bastion host acts as a proxy server,
internal clients connect to the outside through the bastion host, and
external systems respond back to the internal clients through the
host. The bastion host can therefore control the traffic flowing into
and out of the site to any extent desired.
</p>

<p>There can be more than one secure server, and there often is. The
<a name="INDEX-2832" />perimeter network connects the
servers together and connects the exterior router to the interior
router. The systems on the perimeter network are much more exposed to
security threats than are the systems on the interior network. This
is as it must be. After all, the secure servers are needed to provide
service to the outside world as well as to the internal network.
Isolating the systems that must be exposed on a separate network
lessens the chance that a compromise of one of those systems will
lead directly to the compromise of an internal system.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2833" />multi-homed host architecture
attempts to duplicate all of these firewall functions in a single
box. It works by replacing an IP router with a multi-homed host that
does not forward packets at the IP layer.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-140">[140]</a> The
multi-homed host effectively severs the connection between the
interior and exterior networks. To provide the interior network with
some level of network connectivity, it performs similar functions to
the bastion hosts.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-140" /><p>[140]The role of
IP routers, also called gateways, in gluing the Internet together is
covered extensively in earlier chapters.</p> </blockquote>

<p><a href="ch12_07.html#tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-5">Figure 12-5</a> shows a comparison between an IP router
and a multi-homed host firewall. A router handles packets up through
the IP layer. The router forwards each packet based on the
packet's destination address, and the route to that destination
indicated in the routing table. A host, on the other hand, does not
simply forward packets. A multi-homed host can process packets
through the Application Layer, which provides it with complete
control over how packets are handled.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-141">[141]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-141" /><p>[141]See <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Basic Configuration "</a> for information on how to prevent a
multi-homed host from forwarding packets.</p> </blockquote>

<p>This definition of a firewall -- as a device completely distinct
from an IP router -- is not universally accepted. Some people
refer to routers with special security features as firewalls, but
this is really just a matter of semantics. In this book, routers with
special security features are called "secure routers" or
"secure gateways." Firewalls, while they may include
routers, do more than just filter <a name="INDEX-2834" /> <a name="INDEX-2835" />packets. 
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.7.1. Functions of the Firewall </h3>

<p>Ideally, an intruder
<a name="INDEX-2836" />
<a name="INDEX-2837" />cannot mount a direct attack on any of the
systems behind a firewall. Packets destined for hosts behind the
firewall are simply delivered to the firewall. The intruder must
instead mount an attack directly against the firewall machine.
Because the firewall machine can be the target of break-in attacks,
it employs very strict security guidelines. But because there is only
one firewall versus many machines on the local network, it is easier
to enforce strict security on the firewall.
</p>

<p>The disadvantage of a firewall system is obvious. In the same manner
that it restricts access from the outside world into the local
network, it restricts access from the local network to the outside
world. To minimize the inconvenience caused by the firewall, the
system must do many more things than a router does. Some firewalls
provide:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>DNS name service for the outside world</p>
</li><li>
<p>Email forwarding</p>
</li><li>
<p>Proxy services</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Only the minimal services truly needed to communicate with external
systems should be provided on a firewall system. Other common network
services (NIS, NFS, X Windows, <tt class="literal">finger</tt>, etc.)
should generally not be provided. Services are limited to decrease
the number of holes through which an intruder can gain access. On
firewall systems, security is more important than service.
</p>

<p>The biggest problems for the firewall machine are
<tt class="literal">ftp</tt> service and remote terminal service. To
maintain a high level of security, user accounts are discouraged on
the firewall machine; however, user data must pass through the
firewall system for <tt class="literal">ftp</tt> and remote terminal
services. This problem can be handled by creating special user
accounts for <tt class="literal">ftp</tt> and <tt class="literal">telnet</tt>
that are shared by all internal users. But group accounts are
generally viewed as security problems. A better solution is to allow
<tt class="literal">ssh</tt> services through the firewall. This encourages
the use of <tt class="literal">ssh</tt>, which in turn provides strong
authentication and encrypted data exchanges.
</p>

<p>Because a firewall must be constructed with great care to be
effective, and because there are many configuration variables for
setting up a firewall machine, vendors offer special firewall
software. Some vendors sell special-purpose machines designed
specifically for use as firewall systems. There are several low-cost
Linux firewall packages. Before setting up your own firewall,
investigate the options available from software vendors and your
hardware vendor.
</p>

<p>The details of setting up a firewall system are beyond the scope of
this book. Before you proceed, I recommend you read
<em class="emphasis">Building Internet Firewalls</em> and
<em class="emphasis">Firewalls and Internet Security</em>. Unless you have
skilled Unix system administrators with adequate free time, a
do-it-yourself firewall installation is a mistake. Hire a company
that specializes in firewall design and installation. If your
information is valuable enough to protect with a firewall, it should
be valuable enough to protect with a professionally installed
firewall.
</p>

<p>Of course, not every site can afford a professionally installed
firewall -- you might be protecting a small office or even a home
network. If you don't have money or time, you can buy a
low-cost firewall router, sometimes referred to as a
<em class="emphasis">firewall appliance</em>. These boxes are specifically
designed for the small office and home office. They provide basic
packet filtering, proxy services, and network address translation
service, and they often cost only a few hundred dollars. In most
cases, you simply buy the box and plug it in. At the very least, your
network deserves this level of protection. If you have the time and
the skill to build a firewall, you can use a firewall package or the
firewall tools built into your operating systems. A firewall package
increases initial cost, but it is easy to work with. The packet
filtering tools built into the operating system cost nothing but are
the most difficult to configure. The <tt class="literal">iptables</tt> tool
provided with Linux is a good example of the type of firewall tools
provided with some Unix operating systems.

<h3 class="sect2">12.7.2. Filtering Traffic with iptables</h3>

<p>In its simplest
<a name="INDEX-2838" />
<a name="INDEX-2839" /> <a name="INDEX-2840" />
<a name="INDEX-2841" />incarnation,
a firewall is a filtering router that screens out unwanted traffic.
Use the routing capabilities of a multi-homed Linux host combined
with the filtering features of <tt class="literal">iptables</tt> to create
a filtering router.
</p>

<p>The Linux kernel categorizes firewall traffic into three groups and
applies different filter rules to each category of traffic. These
are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>INPUT</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Incoming traffic bound for a process on the local system is tested
against the INPUT filter rules before it is accepted.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>OUTPUT</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Outbound traffic that initiated on the local system is tested against
the OUTPUT filter rules before it is sent.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>FORWARD</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Traffic from one external system bound for another external system is
tested against the FORWARDING filter rules.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The INPUT and OUTPUT rules are used when the system acts as a host.
The FORWARD rules are used when the system acts as a router. In
addition to the three standard categories,
<tt class="literal">iptables</tt> accepts user-defined categories.

<p>Firewall rules are composed of a filter against which the packets are
matched and the action taken when a packet matches the filter. The
action can either be a standard policy or a jump to a user-defined
ruleset for additional processing. The <tt class="literal">-j</tt>
<em class="replaceable">target</em> command-line option identifies the
user-defined ruleset or the standard policy to handle the packet.
<em class="emphasis">target</em> is either the name of a ruleset or a
keyword that identifies a standard policy. The keywords for the
standard policies are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2847" /><dt><i>ACCEPT</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Let the packet pass through the firewall.</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2848" /><dt><i>DROP</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Discard the packet.</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2849" /><dt><i>QUEUE</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Pass the packet up to user space for processing.</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2850" /><dt><i>RETURN</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>In a user-defined ruleset, this means to return to the ruleset that
called this ruleset. In one of the three kernel rulesets, this means
to exit the chain and use the default policy for the chain.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The <tt class="literal">iptables</tt> command constructs filters that match
on the protocol used, the source or destination address, or the
network interface used for the packet, using a variety of
command-line parameters. The basic <tt class="literal">iptables</tt>
parameters
<a name="INDEX-2851" />for building filters are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">-p</tt> <em class="replaceable">protocol</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the protocol to which the rule applies.
<em class="replaceable">protocol</em> can be any numeric value from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em> file or one of the keywords:
<tt class="literal">tcp</tt>, <tt class="literal">udp</tt>, or

</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">-s</tt> <em class="replaceable">address</em><tt class="literal">[/</tt><em class="replaceable">mask</em><tt class="literal">]</tt></b></dt>

source.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">--icmp-type</tt> <em class="replaceable">type</em></b></dt>

<h3 class="sect3">12.7.2.2. Sample iptables commands</h3>

<p>Putting this all together <a name="INDEX-2852" />creates a
firewall that can protect your network. Assume we have a Linux router
attached to a perimeter network with the address 172.16.12.254 on
interface eth0 and to an external network with the address
192.168.6.5 on interface eth1. Further assume that the perimeter
network contains only a sendmail server and an Apache server. Here is
an example of some <tt class="literal">iptables</tt> commands we might use
on the Linux system to protect the perimeter network:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">iptable -F INPUT
iptables -F FORWARD
iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -s 172.16.0.0/16 -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -o eth1 -d 172.16.0.0/16 -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -d 172.16.12.1 25 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -d 172.16.12.6 80 -j ACCEPT 
iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP </pre></blockquote>

<p>The first two commands use the -<tt class="literal">F</tt> option to clear
the rulesets we plan to work with. The third line drops any packets
from the external network that are bound for a process running
locally on the Linux router. We do not allow any access to router
processes from the external world.
</p>

<p>The next two commands drop packets that are being routed to the
external world using an internal address. If packets are received on
the external interface with a source address from the internal
network, they are dropped. Likewise, if packets are being sent out
the external interface with a destination address from the internal
network, they are dropped. These rules say that if packets on the
external network interface (eth1) misuse addresses from the internal
network (172.16), somebody is trying to spoof us and the packets
should be discarded.
</p>

<p>The next two rules are basically identical. They accept packets if
the destination and port are the correct destination and port for a
specific server. For example, port 25 is the SMTP port and
172.16.12.1 is the mail server, and port 80 is the HTTP port and
172.16.12.6 is the web server. We accept these inbound connections
because they are destined for the correct systems. The last rule
rejects all other traffic.
</p>

<p>These examples illustrate the power of Linux's built-in
filtering features and provide enough information to get you started.
Clearly much more can and should be done to build a real firewall. If
you want to know more about <tt class="literal">iptables</tt>, see
<em class="emphasis">Building Internet Firewalls</em> and <em class="emphasis">Linux
Security</em>, both mentioned in the reading list below, for
