<h2 class="sect1">9.4. Network Information Service </h2>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">Network Information Service</em> (NIS)<a href="#FOOTNOTE-105">[105]</a> is an <a name="INDEX-2015" />administrative database that provides
central control and automatic dissemination of important
administrative files. NIS converts several standard Unix files into
databases that can be queried over the network. The databases are
called <a name="INDEX-2016" /><em class="emphasis">NIS
maps</em>. Some maps are created from files that you're
familiar with from system administration, such as the password file
(<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>) and the groups file
(<em class="emphasis">/etc/group</em>). Others are derived from files
related to network administration:
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-105" /><p>[105]NIS was formerly called the "Yellow Pages," or
<em class="emphasis">yp</em>. Although the name has changed, the
abbreviation <em class="emphasis">yp</em> is still used.</p>

</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Check the maps available on your server with the
<tt class="literal">ypcat</tt><a name="INDEX-2023" /> <tt class="literal">-x</tt> command. This
command produced the same map list on both our Solaris and Linux
sample systems. Your server may display a longer list. Here is the
list from a Linux system:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">ypcat -x</b> 
Use "passwd"    for map "passwd.byname" 
Use "group"     for map "group.byname" 
Use "networks"  for map "networks.byaddr" 
Use "hosts"     for map "hosts.byname" 
Use "protocols" for map "protocols.bynumber" 
Use "services"  for map "services.byname" 
Use "aliases"   for map "mail.aliases"
Use "ethers"    for map "ethers.byname"</pre></blockquote>

<p>NIS allows these important administrative files to be maintained on a
central server yet remain completely accessible to every workstation
on the network. All of the maps are stored on a master server that
runs the NIS server process <tt class="literal">ypserv</tt>. The maps are
queried remotely by client systems. Clients run
<tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> to locate the server.
</p>

<p>The NIS server and its clients are a <em class="emphasis">NIS domain</em>,
a
<a name="INDEX-2024" />
<a name="INDEX-2025" />term NIS
shares with DNS. The NIS domain is identified by a NIS domain name.
The only requirement for the name is that different NIS domains
accessible through the same local network must have different names.
Although NIS domains and DNS domains are distinct entities, Sun
recommends using the DNS domain name as the NIS domain name to
simplify administration and reduce confusion.
</p>

<p>NIS uses its domain name to create a directory within
<em class="emphasis">/var/yp</em> where the NIS maps are stored. For
example, the DNS domain of our imaginary network is
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>, so we also use this as our NIS
domain name. NIS creates a directory named
<em class="emphasis">/var/yp/wrotethebook.com</em> and stores the NIS maps
in it.
</p>

<p>While the NIS protocols and commands were originally defined by Sun
icrosystems, the service is now widely implemented. To illustrate
this, the majority of examples in this section come from Linux, not
from Solaris. The syntax of the commands is very similar from system
to system.
</p>

<p>The command
<tt class="literal">domainname</tt><a name="INDEX-2026" /> checks or sets the NIS domain name. The
superuser can make <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> the NIS
domain name by entering:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> # <b class="emphasis-bold">domainname wrotethebook.com</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The NIS domain name is normally configured at startup by placing the
<tt class="literal">domainname</tt> command in one of the startup files. On
many systems, the NIS domain name that is used as input to a
<tt class="literal">domainname</tt> command is placed in a second file. For
example, on Solaris systems, the value for the NIS domain name is
taken from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/defaultdomain</em><a name="INDEX-2027" /> file. As shown here,
<em class="emphasis">defaultdomain</em> contains only the name of the NIS
domain:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">cat /etc/defaultdomain</b>
wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>On <a name="INDEX-2028" />
<a name="INDEX-2029" />Red Hat Linux systems, the NIS domain
name is just one of the values in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/sysconfig/networ</em><a name="INDEX-2030" />k file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">cat /etc/sysconfig/network</b>
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=jerboas.wrotethebook.com
NISDOMAIN=wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>Initialize the NIS server and build the initial maps with
<tt class="literal">make</tt>. The <em class="emphasis">/var/yp/Makefile</em>
contains the instructions needed to build the maps. As noted above,
it creates a directory using the NIS domain name. The Makefile reads
the files in the <em class="emphasis">/etc</em> directory and places maps
created from them in the new directory. To <a name="INDEX-2031" />initialize
a <a name="INDEX-2032" />Linux system as a NIS server:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">domainname wrotethebook.com</b> 
# <b class="emphasis-bold">cd /var/yp</b>  
# <b class="emphasis-bold">make</b> 
make[1]: Entering directory '/var/yp/wrotethebook.com' 
Updating hosts.byname... 
Updating hosts.byaddr... 
Updating networks.byaddr... 
Updating networks.byname... 
Updating protocols.bynumber... 
Updating protocols.byname... 
Updating rpc.byname... 
Updating rpc.bynumber... 
Updating services.byname... 
Updating passwd.byname... 
Updating passwd.byuid... 
Updating group.byname... 
Updating group.bygid... 
Updating netid.byname...
make[1]: Leaving directory '/var/yp/wrotethebook.com'</pre></blockquote>

<p>After initializing the maps, start the NIS server process
<tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> and the NIS binder process
<tt class="literal">ypbind</tt>:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-106">[106]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-106" /><p>[106]If, during the initial
build of the NIS maps, <tt class="literal">make</tt> complains that
<tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> is not registered, run
<tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> before running
<tt class="literal">make</tt>.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">ypserv</b>
# <b class="emphasis-bold">ypbind</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>Our system is now running as both a NIS server and a NIS client. A
quick test with <tt class="literal">ypwhich</tt> shows that we are bound to
the correct server. Use <tt class="literal">ypcat</tt> or
<tt class="literal">ypmatch</tt> to test that you can retrieve data from
the server. We use <tt class="literal">ypcat</tt><a name="INDEX-2033" />
<a name="INDEX-2034" /> in the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">ypwhich</b> 
localhost 
# <b class="emphasis-bold">ypcat hosts</b> 
172.16.55.105            cow cow.wrotethebook.com 
172.16.55.106            pig pig.wrotethebook.com 
172.16.26.36             island.wrotethebook.com island
127.0.0.1                localhost</pre></blockquote>

<p>The clients need only to define the correct domain name and to run
the binder software
<tt class="literal">ypbind</tt><a name="INDEX-2035" />:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">domainname wrotethebook.com</b>
# <b class="emphasis-bold">ypbind</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>Most NIS clients use <tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> to locate the server.
Using the NIS domain name, <tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> broadcasts a
request for a server for that domain. The first server that responds
is the server to which the client "binds." The theory is
that the server that responds quickest is the server with the least
workload. Generally this works well. However, it is possible for the
client to bind to an inappropriate system, e.g., a system that was
accidentally configured to run <tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> or one that
was maliciously configured to be a false server. Because of this
possibility, some systems allow you to explicitly configure the
server to which the client binds. Linux provides the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/yp.conf</em> file for this purpose. The syntax
of the entries in different versions of this file varies, so see your
system documentation before attempting to use it.
</p>

<p>Place the NIS domain name in the appropriate startup file so that the
NIS setup survives the boot. The <tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> and
<tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> commands are probably already in a startup
file. On a Red Hat Linux NIS system, <tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> and
<tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> have their own scripts in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/init.d</em> directory. In addition to putting a
value for NISDOMAIN in <em class="emphasis">/etc/sysconfig/network</em>,
use the <tt class="literal">chkconfig</tt> command to make sure the
<tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> and the <tt class="literal">ypserv</tt> scripts
run at boot time.
</p>

<p>NIS is a possible alternative to DNS, but most systems use both NIS
and DNS. Hostnames can be converted to IP addresses by DNS, NIS, and
the host file. The order in which the various sources are queried is
defined in the <em class="emphasis">nsswitch.conf</em> file.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.4.1. The nsswitch.conf file </h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2036" />Name Service Switch file
(<em class="emphasis">nsswitch.conf</em><a name="INDEX-2037" /><a name="INDEX-2038" />) defines the order in which the sources
of information are searched. Despite its name, it applies to more
than just name service. All of the databases handled by NIS are
covered by the <em class="emphasis">nsswitch.conf</em> file, as shown in
this example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">hosts:      dns  nis  files 
networks:   nis  [NOTFOUND=return]  files 
services:   nis  files
protocols:  nis  files</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first entry in the file says that a hostname lookup is first
passed to DNS for resolution; if DNS fails to find a match, the
lookup is then passed to NIS and finally looked up in the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file. The second entry says that network
names are looked up through NIS. The
<tt class="literal">[NOTFOUND=return]</tt> string says to use the
<em class="emphasis">networks</em> file only if NIS fails to respond, that
is, if NIS is down. In this case, if NIS answers that it cannot find
the requested network name, terminate the search. The last two
entries search for services port and protocol numbers through NIS and
then in the files in the <em class="emphasis">/etc</em> directory.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.4.2. NIS+ </h3>

<p>Before leaving <a name="INDEX-2039" />the topic of
NIS, I should say a word about NIS+. It will be a short discussion,
because I do not use NIS+ and do not know much about it.
</p>

<p>NIS+ replaces NIS on Sun systems. It is not a new version of NIS, but
a completely new software product that provides all the functionality
of NIS and some new features. The new features are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Improved security. NIS does not authenticate servers (as noted in the
<tt class="literal">ypbind</tt> discussion) or clients. NIS+ provides
authentication of users with a secure DES-encrypted authentication
scheme. NIS+ also provides various levels of access so that different
users have authority to look at different levels of data. NIS can
only provide the same access to everyone in the NIS domain.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>A hierarchical, decentralized architecture. NIS+, like DNS, is a
distributed, hierarchical database system. This allows for a very
large namespace. It also allows distributed management of the
information structure while maintaining consistent access to the
data. NIS is a flat structure. All information about a NIS domain
comes from a single master server, and NIS domains are not
interrelated.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enhanced data structures. NIS converts ASCII files into simple keyed
files that the NIS+ documentation calls "two-column
maps." NIS+ builds multicolumn database
<em class="emphasis">tables</em>. Tables can be searched in a variety of
ways to retrieve information about an entry. In addition, NIS+ tables
can be linked together to provide related information about an entry.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Clearly, NIS+ has some excellent new features and advantages over
NIS. So why don't I use it? Good question! The hierarchical
architecture and enhanced data structures are important if you have a
very large network and lots of data in your namespace. However, many
sites evolved using NIS on local subnets and do not see the need to
move the entire enterprise under NIS+. Improved security seems like a
real winner, but sites with low security requirements don't see
the need for additional security, and sites with high security
requirements may already be behind a firewall that blocks external
NIS queries. Additionally, NIS+ is not available for as many
operating systems as NIS. And finally, other directory services, such
as LDAP, that provide similar services and are more widely available
have overtaken NIS+. Taken together, these reasons have slowed the
move to NIS+.
</p>

<p>To learn more about NIS+ and how to install it on your system, read
the <em class="emphasis">NIS+ Transition Guide</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Name
Service Configuration Guide</em>, and the <em class="emphasis">Name
Service Administration Guide</em>. All of these are available
from Sun as part of the Solaris System and Network Administration
manual set.
</p>

<p>NIS and NIS+ provide a wide range of system configuration information
to their clients. However, they cannot provide all the information
needed to configure a TCP/IP system. In the next two sections, we
look at configuration servers that can do the entire job.
