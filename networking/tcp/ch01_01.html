<p>All of us who use a Unix desktop system -- engineers, educators,
scientists, and business people -- have second careers as Unix
system administrators. Networking these computers gives us new tasks
as network administrators.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1" /></a>Network
administration and system administration are two different jobs.
System administration <a name="INDEX-2" /></a>tasks
such as adding users and doing backups are isolated to one
independent computer system. Not so with network administration. Once
you place your computer on a network, it interacts with many other
systems. The way you do network administration tasks has effects,
good and bad, not only on your system but on other systems on the
network. A sound understanding of basic network administration
benefits everyone.
</p>

<p>Networking your computers dramatically enhances their ability to
communicate -- and most computers are used more for communication
than computation. Many mainframes and supercomputers are busy
crunching the numbers for business and science, but the number of
these systems in use pales in comparison to the millions of systems
busy moving mail to a remote colleague or retrieving information from
a remote repository. Further, when you think of the hundreds of
millions of desktop systems that are used primarily for preparing
documents to communicate ideas from one person to another, it is easy
to see why most computers can be viewed as communications devices.
</p>

<p>The positive impact of computer communications increases with the
number and type of computers that participate in the network. One of
the great benefits of TCP/IP is that it provides interoperable
communications between all types of hardware and all kinds of
operating systems.
</p>

<p>The name "TCP/IP" refers
<a name="INDEX-3" /></a>to
an entire suite of data communications protocols. The suite gets its
name from two of the protocols that belong to it: the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP/IP is the
traditional name for this protocol suite and it is the name used in
this book. The TCP/IP protocol suite is also called the Internet
Protocol Suite (IPS). Both names are acceptable.
</p>

<p>This book is a practical, step-by-step guide to configuring and
managing TCP/IP networking software on Unix computer systems. TCP/IP
is the leading communications software for local area networks and
enterprise intranets, and it is the foundation of the worldwide
Internet. TCP/IP is the most important networking software available
to a Unix network administrator.
</p>

<p>The first part of this book discusses the basics of TCP/IP and how it
moves data across a network. The second part explains how to
configure and run TCP/IP on a Unix system. Let's start with a
little history.
</p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">1.1. TCP/IP and the Internet</h2>

<p>In 1969 the <a name="INDEX-4" /></a> <a name="INDEX-5" /></a>Advanced
<a name="INDEX-6" /></a>Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded a
research and development project to create an experimental
packet-switching network. This network, called the
<a name="INDEX-7" /></a><em class="emphasis">ARPAnet</em>,
was built to study techniques for providing robust, reliable,
vendor-independent data communications. Many techniques of modern
data communications were developed in the ARPAnet.
</p>

<p>The experimental network was so successful that many of the
organizations attached to it began to use it for daily data
communications. In 1975 the ARPAnet was converted from an
experimental network to an operational network, and the
responsibility for administering the network was given to the
<a name="INDEX-8" /></a> <a name="INDEX-9" /></a>Defense Communications
Agency (DCA).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>
However, development of the ARPAnet did not stop just because it was
being used as an operational network; the basic TCP/IP protocols were
developed after the network was operational.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-2" /></a><p>[2]DCA has since changed its name to
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).</p> </blockquote>

<p>The TCP/IP protocols
<a name="INDEX-10" /></a>were
adopted as Military Standards (MIL STD) in 1983, and all hosts
connected to the network were required <a name="INDEX-11" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-12" /></a>to convert to the new protocols. To ease
this conversion, DARPA<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a> funded Bolt, Beranek, and
Newman (BBN) to implement TCP/IP in Berkeley (BSD) Unix. Thus began
the marriage <a name="INDEX-13" /></a>of Unix and TCP/IP.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-3" /></a><p>[3]During the 1980s, ARPA, which
is part of the U.S. Department of Defense, became Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Whether it is known as ARPA or
DARPA, the agency and its mission of funding advanced research have
remained the same.</p> </blockquote>

<p>About the time that TCP/IP was adopted as a standard, the term
<em class="emphasis">Internet</em> came into common usage. In 1983 the old
ARPAnet was divided into
<a name="INDEX-14" /></a>MILNET, the
unclassified part of the Defense Data Network <a name="INDEX-15" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-16" /></a>(DDN), and a new, smaller ARPAnet.
"Internet" was used to refer to the entire network:
MILNET plus ARPAnet.
</p>

<p>In 1985 the <a name="INDEX-17" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-18" /></a>National Science
Foundation (NSF) created NSFNet and connected it to the then-existing
Internet. The original NSFNet linked together the five NSF
supercomputer centers. It was smaller than the ARPAnet and no faster:
56Kbps. Still, the creation of the NSFNet was a significant event in
the history of the Internet because NSF brought with it a new vision
of the use of the Internet. NSF wanted to extend the network to every
scientist and engineer in the United States. To accomplish this, in
1987 NSF created a new, faster backbone and a three-tiered network
topology that included the backbone, regional networks, and local
networks. In 1990 the ARPAnet formally passed out of existence, and
in 1995 the NSFNet ceased its role as a primary Internet backbone
network.
</p>

<p>Today the Internet is larger than ever and encompasses hundreds of
thousands of networks worldwide. It is no longer dependent on a core
(or backbone) network or on governmental support. Today's
Internet is built by commercial providers. National network
providers, called <a name="INDEX-19" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-20" /></a>tier-one providers, and regional
network providers create the infrastructure. <a name="INDEX-21" /></a>Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) provide <a name="INDEX-22" /></a>local access and user
services. This network of networks is linked together in the United
States at several major interconnection points called Network Access
Points (NAPs).
</p>

<p>The Internet <a name="INDEX-23" /></a>has grown far beyond its original scope.
The original networks and agencies that built the Internet no longer
play an essential role for the current network. The Internet has
evolved from a simple backbone network, through a three-tiered
hierarchical structure, to a huge network of interconnected,
distributed network hubs. It has grown exponentially since
1983 -- doubling in size every year. Through all of this
incredible change one thing has remained constant: the Internet is
built on the TCP/IP protocol suite.
</p>

<p>A sign of the network's success is the confusion that surrounds
the term <em class="emphasis">internet</em>. Originally it was used only
as the name of the network built upon IP. Now
<em class="emphasis">internet</em> is a generic term used to refer to an
entire class of networks. An internet (lowercase "i") is
any collection of separate physical networks, interconnected by a
common protocol, to form a single logical network. The Internet
(uppercase "I") is the worldwide collection of
interconnected networks, which grew out of the original ARPAnet, that
uses IP to link the various physical networks into a single logical
network. In this book, both "internet" and
"Internet" refer to networks that are interconnected by
TCP/IP.
</p>

<p>Because TCP/IP is required for Internet connection, the growth of the
Internet spurred interest in TCP/IP. As more organizations became
familiar with TCP/IP, they saw that its power can be applied in other
network applications as well. The Internet protocols are often used
for local area networking even when the local network is not
connected to the Internet. TCP/IP is also widely used to build
enterprise networks. TCP/IP-based enterprise networks that use
Internet techniques and web tools to disseminate internal corporate
information are called
<a name="INDEX-24" /></a><em class="emphasis">intranets</em>.
TCP/IP is the foundation of all of these varied networks.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.1. TCP/IP Features</h3>

<p>The popularity of the
<a name="INDEX-25" /></a>TCP/IP protocols did not grow rapidly just
because the protocols were there, or because connecting to the
Internet mandated their use. They met an important need (worldwide
data communication) at the right time, and they had several important
features that allowed them to meet this need. These features are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Open protocol
<a name="INDEX-26" /></a>standards,
<a name="INDEX-27" /></a>freely
available and developed independently from any specific computer
hardware or operating system. Because it is so widely supported,
TCP/IP is ideal for uniting different hardware and software
components, even if you don't communicate over the Internet.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Independence from
<a name="INDEX-28" /></a>specific physical network
hardware. This allows TCP/IP to integrate many different kinds of
networks. TCP/IP can be run over an Ethernet, a DSL connection, a
dial-up line, an optical network, and virtually any other kind of
physical transmission medium.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="INDEX-29" /></a>A common
addressing scheme that allows any TCP/IP device to uniquely address
any other device in the entire network, even if the network is as
large as the worldwide Internet.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Standardized high-level protocols for consistent, widely available
user services.
</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.2. Protocol Standards</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-30" /></a>Protocols
<a name="INDEX-31" /></a>are
formal rules of behavior. In international relations, protocols
minimize the problems caused by cultural differences when various
nations work together. By agreeing to a common set of rules that are
widely known and independent of any nation's customs,
diplomatic protocols minimize misunderstandings; everyone knows how
to act and how to interpret the actions of others. Similarly, when
computers communicate, it is necessary to define a set of rules to
govern their communications.
</p>

<p>In data communications, these sets of rules are also called
<em class="emphasis">protocols</em>. In homogeneous networks, a single
computer vendor specifies a set of communications rules designed to
use the strengths of the vendor's operating system and hardware
architecture. But homogeneous networks are like the culture of a
single country -- only the natives are truly at home in it. TCP/IP
creates a heterogeneous network
<a name="INDEX-32" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-33" /></a>with
open protocols that are independent of operating system and
architectural differences. TCP/IP protocols are available to everyone
and are developed and changed by consensus, not by the fiat of one
manufacturer. Everyone is free to develop products to meet these open
protocol specifications.
</p>

<p>The open nature of TCP/IP protocols requires an open
<a name="INDEX-34" /></a> <a name="INDEX-35" /></a>standards
development process and publicly available standards documents.
Internet standards are developed by the <a name="INDEX-36" /></a>Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) in open, public meetings. The protocols developed in this
process are published <a name="INDEX-37" /></a>as <em class="emphasis">Requests
for Comments</em><a name="INDEX-38" /></a> (RFCs).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a> As the title "Request
for Comments" implies, the style and content of these documents
are much less rigid than in most standards documents. RFCs contain a
wide range of interesting and useful information, and are not limited
to the formal specification of data communications protocols. There
are three basic types of RFCs: standards (STD), best current
practices (BCP), and informational (FYI).
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-4" /></a><p>[4]Interested in finding out how Internet standards are created?
Read RFC 2026<em class="emphasis">, The Internet Standards
Process</em>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>RFCs that define official protocol standards are
<a name="INDEX-39" /></a><a name="INDEX-40" /></a>STDs and are given an STD number
in addition to an RFC number. Creating an official Internet standard
is a rigorous process. <em class="emphasis">Standards track</em> RFCs pass
through three <em class="emphasis">maturity levels</em> before becoming
standards:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Proposed Standard</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a <a name="INDEX-41" /></a>protocol specification that is important
enough and has received enough Internet community support to be
considered for a standard. The specification is stable and well
understood, but it is not yet a standard and may be withdrawn from
consideration to be a standard.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Draft Standard</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a <a name="INDEX-42" /></a>protocol specification for which at least
two independent, interoperable implementations exist. A draft
standard is a final specification undergoing widespread testing. It
will change only if the testing forces a change.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Internet Standard</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A specification <a name="INDEX-43" /></a>is declared a standard only after
extensive testing and only if the protocol defined in the
specification is considered to be of significant benefit to the
Internet community.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>There are two categories
<a name="INDEX-44" /></a>of standards. A <em class="emphasis">Technical
Specification</em> (TS) <a name="INDEX-45" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-46" /></a>defines a protocol. An
<em class="emphasis">Applicability Statement</em> (AS)
<a name="INDEX-47" /></a> <a name="INDEX-48" /></a>defines when the protocol is to be
used. There are three <em class="emphasis">requirement levels</em> that
define the applicability of a standard:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Required</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This standard <a name="INDEX-49" /></a>protocol is a required part of every
TCP/IP implementation. It must be included for the TCP/IP stack to be
compliant.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Recommended</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This standard <a name="INDEX-50" /></a>protocol should be included in every
TCP/IP implementation, although it is not required for minimal
compliance.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Elective</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This <a name="INDEX-51" /></a>standard is optional. It is up to the
software vendor to implement it or not.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Two other requirements levels (<em class="emphasis">limited use</em> and
<em class="emphasis">not recommended</em>) apply to RFCs that are not part
of the standards track. A "<a name="INDEX-52" /></a>limited use" protocol is used
only in special circumstances, such as during an experiment. A
protocol is "<a name="INDEX-53" /></a>not
recommended<a name="INDEX-54" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-55" /></a>" when it has limited
functionality or is outdated. There are three types of
<em class="emphasis">non-standards track</em> RFCs:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Experimental</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <a name="INDEX-56" /></a>experimental RFC is limited to use in
research and development.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Historic</i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-57" /></a>A
historic RFC is outdated and no longer recommended for use.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Informational</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <a name="INDEX-58" /></a>informational RFC provides information of
general interest to the Internet community; it does not define an
Internet standard protocol.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>A subset of the informational RFCs is called the
<a name="INDEX-59" /></a>FYI (For Your Information) notes. An FYI
document is given an FYI number in addition to an RFC number. FYI
documents provide introductory and background material about the
Internet and TCP/IP networks. FYI documents are not mentioned in RFC
2026 and are not included in the Internet standards process. But
there are several interesting FYI documents available.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-5" /></a><p>[5]To find out more about FYI documents, read RFC 1150,
<em class="emphasis">FYI on FYI: An Introduction to the FYI
Notes</em>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Another group of RFCs that go beyond documenting protocols are the
<a name="INDEX-60" /></a>Best Current Practices (BCP) RFCs. BCPs
formally document techniques and procedures. Some of these document
the way that the IETF conducts itself; RFC 2026 is an example of this
type of BCP. Others provide guidelines for the operation of a network
or service; RFC 1918, <em class="emphasis">Address Allocation for Private
Internets</em>, is an example of this type of BCP. BCPs that
provide operational guidelines are often of great interest to network
administrators.
</p>

<p>There are now more than 3,000 RFCs. As a network system
administrator, you will no doubt read several. It is as important to
know which ones to read as it is to understand them when you do read
them. Use the RFC categories and the requirements levels to help you
determine which RFCs are applicable to your situation. (A good
starting point is to focus on those RFCs that also have an STD
number.) To understand what you read, you need to understand the
language of data communications. RFCs contain protocol implementation
specifications defined in terminology that is unique <a name="INDEX-61" /></a><a name="INDEX-62" /></a>to data
communications.
