<h2 class="sect1">5.2. Startup Files </h2>

<p>The kernel <a name="INDEX-1070" />
<a name="INDEX-1071" /> <a name="INDEX-1072" />configuration brings the basic
transport and IP datagram services of TCP/IP into Unix. But there is
much more to the TCP/IP suite than just the basic services. How are
these other protocols included in the Unix configuration?
</p>

<p>Some protocols are explicitly started by including them in the boot
files. This technique is used, for example, to start the Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) and the Domain Name System (DNS). Network
services that either have a long startup procedure or are in constant
demand are normally started by a script at boot time, and run as
daemon processes the entire time the system is running.
</p>

<p>Anything that can be run from a shell prompt can be stored in a file
and run as a shell script. Systems use this capability to automate
the startup of system services. There are two basic Unix startup
models that control how startup files are invoked: the BSD model and
the System V model.
</p>

<p>The BSD <a name="INDEX-1073" />model is the simplest: a limited number
of startup scripts are executed in order every time the system boots.
At its simplest, there are three basic scripts,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc</em>, <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.boot,</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.local</em>, executed in that order for system
initialization, service initialization, and local customization. On
BSD Unix systems, network services are usually started by the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.boot</em> file or the <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.local</em>
file.
</p>

<p>On systems that use the BSD startup model, place customized network
configuration commands in the <em class="emphasis">rc.local</em> script.
<em class="emphasis">rc.local</em> executes at the end of the startup
process. Any configuration values set in this file override the
earlier configuration commands.
</p>

<p>The BSD startup model is used on BSD systems and SunOS systems. Linux
and Solaris systems use the <a name="INDEX-1074" />System V startup model. The System V
startup model employs a much more complex set of startup
files.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-48">[48]</a> This model uses whole directories of
scripts executed by the <tt class="literal">init</tt> process, with
different directories being used depending on the runlevel of the
system.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-48" /><p>[48]A good description of the maze of System V
initialization files is provided in <em class="emphasis">Essential System
Administration</em> by &AElig;leen Frisch (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates).</p> </blockquote>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-5-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.1. Startup Runlevels</h3>

<p>To understand <a name="INDEX-1075" />
<a name="INDEX-1076" />System V startup, you need to
understand <em class="emphasis">runlevels</em>, which are used to indicate
the state of the system when the <tt class="literal">init</tt> process is
complete. There is nothing inherent in the system hardware that
recognizes runlevels; they are purely a software construct.
<tt class="literal">init</tt> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inittab --</em> the file used to configure
<tt class="literal">init</tt> -- are the only reasons why the runlevels
affect the state of the system. We use Red Hat Linux as an example of
how runlevels are used.
</p>

<p>Linux defines
<a name="INDEX-1077" />several
runlevels that run the full gamut of possible system states from
not-running (halted) to running multiple processes for multiple
users:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Runlevel 0 shuts down all running processes and halts the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runlevel 1 places the system in single-user mode. Single-user mode is
used by the system administrator to perform maintenance that cannot
be done when users are logged in. This runlevel may also be indicated
by the letter S instead of the number 1. Solaris uses S for
single-user mode.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runlevel 2 is a special multiuser mode that does not support file
sharing.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runlevel 3 provides full multiuser support with the full range of
services, including NFS file sharing. It is the default mode used on
Solaris systems.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runlevel 4 is unused. You can design your own system state and
implement it through runlevel 4.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runlevel 5 initializes the system as a dedicated X Windows terminal.
Linux systems use this to provide an X Windows console login. When
Linux systems boot at runlevel 3, they provide a text-based console
login. Solaris does not use this runlevel. Entering runlevel 5 on a
Solaris system causes a system shutdown.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runlevel 6 shuts down all running processes and reboots the system.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>As these notes make clear, different systems use the same runlevels
in different ways. That is because runlevels are software. They are
boot command arguments that tell <tt class="literal">init</tt> which
startup scripts should be run. The scripts that are run can contain
any valid commands. <tt class="literal">init</tt> maps runlevels to startup
scripts using the <em class="emphasis">inittab</em> file.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-5-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.2.1.1. Understanding /etc/inittab</h3>

<p>All of the lines in the
<em class="emphasis">inittab</em><a name="INDEX-1078" />
<a name="INDEX-1079" /> <a name="INDEX-1080" /> file
that begin with a sharp sign (#) are
<a name="INDEX-1081" /> <a name="INDEX-1082" /> <a name="INDEX-1083" />comments.
A liberal dose of comments is needed because the syntax of
<em class="emphasis">inittab</em> configuration lines is terse and arcane.
An <em class="emphasis">inittab</em> entry has this general format:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="replaceable">label:runlevel:action:process</em></pre></blockquote>

<p>The <em class="replaceable">label</em><a name="INDEX-1084" /> is a one- to four-character tag
that identifies the entry. Because some systems support only
two-character labels, most configurations limit all labels to two
characters. The labels can be any arbitrary character string; they
have no intrinsic meaning.
</p>

<p>The <em class="replaceable">runlevel</em><a name="INDEX-1085" /> field indicates the
runlevels to which the entry applies. For example, if the field
contains a 3, the process identified by the entry must be run for the
system to initialize runlevel 3. More than one runlevel can be
specified. Entries that have an empty runlevel field are not involved
in initializing specific runlevels. For example, Linux systems have
an <em class="emphasis">inittab</em> entry to handle the three-finger
salute (Ctrl+Alt+Del); it does not have a value in the runlevel
field.
</p>

<p>The <em class="replaceable">action</em><a name="INDEX-1086" /> field defines the conditions
under which the process is run. <a href="ch05_02.html#tcp3-CHP-5-TABLE-1">Table 5-1</a> lists
the action values used on Red Hat, Mandrake, and Caldera Linux
systems.

</table><p>

<p>The last field in an <em class="emphasis">inittab</em> entry is
<em class="replaceable">process</em><a name="INDEX-1087" />. It contains the process that
<tt class="literal">init</tt> executes. The process appears in the exact
format that it is executed from the command line. Therefore the
<em class="replaceable">process</em> field starts with the name of the
program that is to be executed followed by the arguments that will be
passed to that process. For example,
<tt class="literal">/sbin/shutdown</tt> <tt class="literal">-t3</tt>
<tt class="literal">-r</tt> <tt class="literal">now</tt>, which is the process
executed by some Linux systems when Ctrl+Alt+Del is pressed, is the
same command that could be typed at the shell prompt to reboot the
system. On most <em class="emphasis">inittab</em> entries, the
<em class="replaceable">process</em> field contains the name of a
startup script. Two main types of startup scripts are used: the
system initialization script and the runlevel initialization scripts.
These sample lines from a Red Hat Linux system show both:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># System initialization.
si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

l0:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 0
l1:1:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 1
l2:2:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 2
l3:3:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 3
l4:4:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 4
l5:5:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 5
l6:6:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 6</pre></blockquote>

<p>These seven lines are the real heart of the
<em class="emphasis">inittab</em> file -- they invoke the startup
scripts. The first line tells <tt class="literal">init</tt> to run the boot
script located at <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</em> to
initialize the system. This entry has no runlevel value. It is run
every time the system starts. The system initialization script
performs certain essential tasks. For example, the Red Hat
<em class="emphasis">rc.sysinit</em><a name="INDEX-1088" />
<a name="INDEX-1089" /> script:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Initializes the swap space</p>
</li><li>
<p>Runs the filesystem check</p>
</li><li>
<p>Mounts the <em class="emphasis">/proc</em> filesystem </p>
</li><li>
<p>Mounts the root filesystem as read-write after the
<tt class="literal">fsck</tt> completes
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Loads the loadable kernel modules</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Other initialization scripts may look different than Red Hat's,
but they perform very similar functions. For example, a Caldera
system begins by loading the loadable modules. It then activates the
swap space, does the filesystem check, and remounts the root
filesystem as read-write. The order is different, but the major
functions are the same.
</p>

<p>After the system initialization script is run,
<tt class="literal">init</tt> runs a <a name="INDEX-1090" /><a name="INDEX-1091" />script for the specific runlevel. The
remaining six lines in the sample are used to invoke the startup
scripts for individual runlevels. Except for the runlevel involved,
each line is identical.
</p>

<p>Let's use the line with label <tt class="literal">l3</tt> as an
example. This line starts all of the processes and services needed to
provide the full multiuser support. The runlevel is 3. The action
<tt class="literal">wait</tt> directs <tt class="literal">init</tt> to wait until
the startup script terminates before going on to any other entries in
the <em class="emphasis">inittab</em> file that relate to runlevel 3.
<tt class="literal">init</tt> executes the script
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/rc</em> and passes that script the
command-line argument <tt class="literal">3</tt>.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1092" />control script,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/rc</em>, then runs all the scripts that are
appropriate for the runlevel. It does this by running the scripts
that are stored in the directory
<tt class="literal">/etc/rc</tt><em class="replaceable">n</em><tt class="literal">.d</tt>,
where <em class="replaceable">n</em> is the specified runlevel. In our
example, the <em class="emphasis">rc</em> script is passed a 3, so it runs
the scripts found in the directory
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/rc3.d</em>. A listing of that directory
from a Red Hat system shows that there are lots of scripts:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">ls /etc/rc.d</b>
init.d  rc0.d  rc2.d  rc4.d  rc6.d     rc.sysinit
rc      rc1.d  rc3.d  rc5.d  rc.local

K20rwalld     K55routed    K84ospf6d  S12syslog    S56rawdevices  S99local

K35dhcpd      K74nscd      K85zebra   S20random    S85gpm</pre></blockquote>

<p>The scripts that begin with a K are used to kill processes when
exiting a specific runlevel. In the listing above, the K scripts
would be used when terminating runlevel 3. The scripts that start
with an S are used when starting runlevel 3. None of the items in
<em class="emphasis">rc3.d</em>, however, is really a startup script. They
are logical links to the real scripts, which are located in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/init.d</em> directory. For example,
<em class="emphasis">S80sendmail</em> is linked to
<em class="emphasis">init.d/sendmail</em>. This raises the question of why
the scripts are executed from the directory
<em class="emphasis">rc3.d</em> instead of directly from
<em class="emphasis">init.d</em> where they actually reside. The reasons
are simple. The same scripts are needed for several different
runlevels. Using logical links, the scripts can be stored in one
place and still be accessed by every runlevel from the directory used
by that runlevel.
</p>

<p>Scripts are executed in alphabetical order. Thus
<em class="emphasis">S10network</em> is executed before
<em class="emphasis">S80sendmail</em>. This allows the system to control
the order in which scripts are executed through simple naming
conventions. Different runlevels can execute the scripts in different
orders while still allowing the real scripts in
<em class="emphasis">init.d</em> to have simple, descriptive names. A
listing of the <em class="emphasis">init.d</em> directory shows these
descriptive names:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">ls /etc/rc.d/init.d</b>
amd       functions  kdcrotate  network  rarpd       rwalld    xfs
anacron   gated      keytable   nfs      rawdevices  rwhod     xinetd
apmd      gpm        killall    nfslock  reconfig    sendmail  ypbind
arpwatch  halt       kudzu      nscd     rhnsd       single    yppasswdd
atd       httpd      ldap       ntpd     ripd        smb       ypserv
autofs    identd     linuxconf  ospf6d   ripngd      snmpd     ypxfrd

dhcpd     isdn       netfs      random   rusersd     tux</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is possible to place a customized configuration command directly
in the applicable script in the <em class="emphasis">init.d</em>
directory. A better alternative on a Red Hat system is to place any
local changes in <em class="emphasis">rc.local</em>.
</p>

<p>Like BSD systems, Linux systems provide an
<em class="emphasis">rc.local</em><a name="INDEX-1093" />
<a name="INDEX-1094" /> script for local customization. In
general, you do not directly edit boot scripts. The exception to this
rule is the <em class="emphasis">rc.local</em> script located in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d</em> directory. It is the one customizable
startup file, and it is reserved for your use; you can put anything
you want in there. After the system initialization script executes,
the runlevel scripts execute in alphabetical order. The last of these
is <em class="emphasis">S99local</em>, which is a link to
<em class="emphasis">rc.local</em>. Since it is executed last, the values
set in the <em class="emphasis">rc.local</em> script override other
configuration values.
</p>

<p>Solaris also uses the
<a name="INDEX-1095" />System V startup model, but it makes
things a little more difficult than Linux does. First off, it does
not provide an <em class="emphasis">rc.local</em> script. If you want to
use one, you need to add your own to the runlevel directories.
Secondly, Solaris does not use many logical links in the runlevel
directories. Therefore, there is no guarantee of a central place to
modify scripts that are used for all runlevels. Additionally, each
runlevel has a separate controlling script that can introduce
differences in the startup process for each runlevel. For example,
<em class="emphasis">/sbin/rc2</em> is the controlling script for runlevel
2 and <em class="emphasis">/sbin/rc3</em> is the controlling script for
runlevel 3. All of these differences make the Solaris startup process
more complex to analyze.
</p>

<p>On a Solaris
<a name="INDEX-1096" />8
system, runlevel 3 is the default runlevel for a multiuser system
offering network services. The <em class="emphasis">/sbin/rc3</em>
controlling script runs the scripts in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc2.d</em> and then those in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc3.d</em>. Basic network configuration is
handled in <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc2.d</em> by the
<em class="emphasis">S69inet</em> script and the
<em class="emphasis">S72inetsvc</em> script. Several other scripts in both
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc2.d</em> and <em class="emphasis">/etc/rc3.d</em>
are involved in launching network services.
</p>

<p>For troubleshooting purposes it is important to understand where and
how things happen during the system startup. When the network fails
to initialize properly, it is good to know where to look. However,
when you configure the network you should stick with the standard
tools and procedures provided with your system. Directly modifying
startup scripts can cause problems during the startup and can lead to
lots of confusion for the other people who help you maintain your
systems.
</p>

<p>Of course, not all network services are started by a boot script.
ost network services are started on demand. The most widely used
tool for starting network services on demand
is<a name="INDEX-1097" />
<tt class="literal">inetd</tt>, the Internet Daemon.
