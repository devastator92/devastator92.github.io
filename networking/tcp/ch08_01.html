<p>Congratulations! You have installed TCP/IP in the kernel, configured
the network interface, and configured routing. At this point, you
have completed all of the configuration tasks required to run TCP/IP
on a Unix system. While none of the remaining tasks is
<em class="emphasis">required</em> for TCP/IP software to operate, they
are necessary for making the network more friendly and useful. In the
next two chapters, we look at how to configure basic TCP/IP network
services. Perhaps the most important of these is name service.
</p>

<p>It is, as the name implies, a service -- specifically, a service
intended to make the network more user-friendly. Computers are
perfectly happy with IP addresses, but people prefer names. The
importance of name service is indicated by the amount of coverage it
has in this book. <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a> discusses
<em class="emphasis">why</em> name service is needed; this chapter covers
<em class="emphasis">how</em> it is configured; and <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "A named Reference"</a> covers the <em class="emphasis">details</em> of the
name server configuration commands. This chapter provides sufficient
information to show you how to configure the BIND software to run on
your system.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-82">[82]</a> But if you want to know more about why
something is done or details on how to do it, don't hesitate to
refer to <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a> and <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "A named Reference"</a>.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-82" /></a><p>[82]BIND 8 is the version of domain name
software that comes with most versions of Linux and with Solaris 8. A
newer version of DNS software -- BIND 9 -- is also available.
BIND 8 and BIND 9 use essentially the same configuration file syntax.
The examples presented here should work with both BIND 8 and BIND
9.</p> </blockquote>


<div class="sect1"><a name="tcp3-CHP-8-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">8.1. BIND: Unix Name Service </h2>

<p>In Unix, DNS is <a name="INDEX-1563" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1564" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1565" /></a>implemented<a name="INDEX-1566" /></a> by the
<em class="emphasis">Berkeley Internet Name Domain</em> (BIND) software.
BIND is a client/server software system. The client side of BIND is
called the <em class="emphasis">resolver</em>. It generates the queries
for domain name information and sends them to the server. The DNS
server software answers the resolver's queries. The server side
of BIND is a daemon called
<tt class="literal">named</tt><a name="INDEX-1567" /></a> (pronounced "name"
"d").
</p>

<p>This chapter covers three basic BIND configuration tasks:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Configuring the BIND resolver</p>
</li><li>
<p>Configuring the BIND name server (<tt class="literal">named</tt>)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Constructing the name server database files, called the
<em class="emphasis">zone files</em>
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>A <em class="emphasis">zone</em>
<a name="INDEX-1568" /></a>is a piece of the
<a name="INDEX-1569" /></a>domain
namespace over which a name server holds authority. A zone cannot
contain a domain that is delegated to another server. Here we use
"zone" to refer to the DNS database file, while the term
"domain" is used in more general contexts. In this book,
a domain is part of the domain hierarchy identified by a domain name.
A zone is a collection of domain information contained in a DNS
database file. The file that contains the domain information is
called a zone file.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1570" /></a>RFC 1033, the
<em class="emphasis">Domain Administrators Operations Guide</em>, defines
the basic set of standard records used to construct zone files. Many
RFCs propose new DNS records that are not widely implemented. In this
chapter and in <a href="appc_01.html">Appendix C, "A named Reference"</a>, we stick to the basic
resource records that you are most likely to use. We'll use
these records to construct the zone files used in this chapter. But
how, or even if, you need to construct zone files on your system is
controlled by the type of BIND configuration you decide to use.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-8-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.1.1. BIND Configurations </h3>

<p>BIND configurations <a name="INDEX-1571" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1572" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1573" /></a>are
described by the type of service the software is configured to
provide. The four levels of service that can be defined in a BIND
configuration are <em class="emphasis">resolver-only systems</em>,
<em class="emphasis">caching-only servers</em>, <em class="emphasis">master
servers</em>, and <em class="emphasis">slave servers</em>.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1574" /></a>resolver is
the code that asks name servers for domain information. On Unix
systems, it is implemented as a library rather than as a separate
client program. Some systems, called resolver-only systems, use only
the resolver; they don't run a name server. Resolver-only
systems are very easy to configure: you just need to set up the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</em><a name="INDEX-1575" /></a> file.
</p>

<p>The three other BIND configurations all require that the local system
run the <tt class="literal">named</tt> server software. They are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Master</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1576" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1577" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1578" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1579" /></a>master name server is the authoritative
source for all information about a specific zone. It loads the domain
information from a locally maintained disk file that is built by the
domain administrator. This file (the zone file) contains the most
accurate information about a piece of the domain hierarchy over which
this name server has authority. The master server is an authoritative
server because it can answer any query about its zone with full
authority.
</p>

<p>Configuring a master server requires creating a complete set of
configuration files: zone files for the forward-mapping zone and the
reverse-mapping zone, the conf file, the root hints file, and the
loopback file. No other configuration requires creating this complete
set of files.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Slave</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A slave <a name="INDEX-1580" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1581" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1582" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1583" /></a>server
transfers a complete set of zone information from the master server.
The zone data is transferred from the master server and stored on the
slave server as a local disk file. This transfer is aptly called a
<em class="emphasis">zone transfer</em><a name="INDEX-1584" /></a>. A slave server keeps a complete copy
of all zone information and can answer queries about that zone with
authority. Therefore, a slave server is also considered an
authoritative server.
</p>


<p>Configuring a slave server does not require creating local zone files
because the zone files are downloaded from the master server.
However, other files (a boot file, a cache file, and a loopback file)
are required.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Caching-only</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A caching-only <a name="INDEX-1585" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1586" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1587" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-1588" /></a>server
runs the name server software but keeps no zone files. It learns the
answer to every name server query from some remote server. Once it
learns an answer, the server caches the answer and uses it to answer
future queries for the same information. All name servers use cached
information in this manner, but a caching-only server depends on this
technique for all of its name server information. It is not
considered an authoritative server because all of the information it
provides is secondhand. Only a boot file and a cache file are
required for a caching-only configuration, but the most common
configuration also includes a loopback file. This is probably the
most common name server configuration, and apart from the
resolver-only configuration, it is the easiest to configure.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>A name server may use any one of these configurations or, as is often
the case, it may combine elements of more than one type of
configuration. However, all systems run the resolver, so let's
begin by examining the configuration of the client side of the DNS
software.
