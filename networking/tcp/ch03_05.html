<h2 class="sect1">3.5. File and Print Servers</h2>

<p>File and print services make the network more convenient for users.
Not long ago, disk drives and high-quality printers were relatively
expensive, and diskless workstations were common. Today, every system
has a large hard drive and many have their own high-quality laser
printers, but the demand for resource-sharing services is higher than
ever.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.5.1. File Sharing</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-740" />
<a name="INDEX-741" />File sharing is not the same as file
transfer; it is not simply the ability to move a file from one system
to another. A true file-sharing system does not require you to move
files across the network. It allows files to be accessed at the
record level so that it is possible for a client to read a record
from a file located on a remote server, update that record, and write
it back to the server -- without moving the entire file from the
server to the client.
</p>

<p>File sharing is transparent to the user and to the application
software running on the user's system. Through file sharing,
users and programs access files located on remote systems as if they
were local files. In a perfect file-sharing environment, the user
neither knows nor cares where files are actually stored.
</p>

<p>File sharing didn't exist in the original TCP/IP protocol
suite. It was added to support diskless workstations. Several TCP/IP
protocols for file sharing have been defined, but two hold the
lion's share of the file sharing market:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">NetBIOS/Server Message Block</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-742" />NetBIOS was originally defined by IBM. It
is the basic networking used on Microsoft Windows systems. Unix
systems can act as file and print servers for Windows clients by
running the Samba software package that implements NetBIOS and
<a name="INDEX-743" />
<a name="INDEX-744" />Server Message Block (SMB) protocols.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Network File System</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-745" />NFS was defined by Sun Microsystems to
support their diskless workstations. NFS is designed primarily for
LAN applications and is implemented for all Unix systems and many
other operating systems.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>For file sharing between Unix systems, you will probably use NFS, as
it is the most widely used Unix file-sharing protocol. If you need to
support Windows clients using Unix servers, you will probably use
Samba. For a detailed discussion of both of these tools, see <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Local Network Services"</a>. 
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.5.2. Print Services</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-746" />
<a name="INDEX-747" />A print server allows printers to be
shared by everyone on the network. Printer sharing is not as
important as file sharing, but it is a useful network service. The
advantages of printer sharing are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Fewer printers are needed, and less money is spent on printers and
supplies.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reduced maintenance. There are fewer machines to maintain, and fewer
people spending time fiddling with printers.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Access to special printers. Very high-quality color printers and very
high-speed printers are expensive and needed only occasionally.
Sharing these printers makes the best use of expensive resources.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>There are two techniques commonly used for sharing printers on a
corporate network. One technique is to use the sharing services
provided by <a name="INDEX-748" />Samba. This is the technique preferred
by Windows clients. The other approach is to use the traditional Unix
<tt class="literal">lpr</tt> <a name="INDEX-749" />
<a name="INDEX-750" />command and an <tt class="literal">lpd</tt>
server. Print server configuration is also covered in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Local Network Services"</a>. 
</p>

<p>This chapter concludes with a discussion of the various types of
TCP/IP configuration servers. Unlike email, file sharing, and print
servers, configuration servers are not used on every network.
However, the demand for easier installation and improved mobility
makes configuration servers an important part of many networks.
