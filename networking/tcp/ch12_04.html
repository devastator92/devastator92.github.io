<h2 class="sect1">12.4. Security Monitoring </h2>

<p>A key element of effective network security is security monitoring.
Good security is an ongoing process, and following the security
guidelines discussed above is just the beginning. You must also
monitor the systems to detect unauthorized user activity and to
locate and close security holes. Over time, a system will
change -- active accounts become inactive and file permissions are
changed. You need to detect and fix these problems as they arise.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.4.1. Know Your System </h3>

<p>Network security is
<a name="INDEX-2713" />
<a name="INDEX-2714" /> <a name="INDEX-2715" />monitored
by examining the files and logs of individual systems on the network.
To detect unusual activity on a system, you must know what activity
is normal. What processes are normally running? Who is usually logged
in? Who commonly logs in after hours? You need to know this, and
more, about your system in order to develop a "feel" for
how things should be. Some common Unix
commands -- <tt class="literal">ps</tt> and
<tt class="literal">who</tt> -- can help you learn what normal activity
is for your system.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">ps</tt> command displays the status of currently
running processes. Run <tt class="literal">ps</tt> regularly to gain a
clear picture of what processes run on the system at different times
of the day and who runs them. The Linux <tt class="literal">ps -au</tt>
command and the Solaris <tt class="literal">ps -ef</tt> command display the
user and the command that initiated each process. This should be
sufficient information to learn who runs what and when they run it.
If you notice something unusual, investigate it. Make sure you
understand how your system is being used.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">who</tt><a name="INDEX-2716" /> command provides information about who is
currently logged into your system. It displays who is logged in, what
device they are using, when they logged in and, if applicable, what
remote host they logged in from. (The <tt class="literal">w</tt> command, a
variation of <tt class="literal">who</tt> available on some systems, also
displays the currently active process started by each user.) The
<tt class="literal">who</tt> command helps you learn who is usually logged
in as well as what remote hosts they normally log in from.
Investigate any variations from the norm.
</p>

<p>If any of these routine checks gives you reason to suspect a security
problem, examine the system for unusual or modified files, for files
that you know should be there but aren't, and for unusual login
activity. This close examination of the system can also be made using
everyday Unix commands. Not every command or file we discuss will be
available on every system. But every system will have some tools that
help you keep a close eye on how your system is being used.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.4.2. Looking for Trouble </h3>

<p>Intruders often
<a name="INDEX-2717" />
<a name="INDEX-2718" /> <a name="INDEX-2719" />leave behind files or shell scripts to
help them re-enter the system or gain root access. Use the
<tt class="literal">ls -a | grep '^\'.</tt> command to check for files with
names that begin with a dot (<em class="emphasis">.</em>). Intruders
particularly favor names such as <em class="emphasis">.mail</em>,
<em class="emphasis">.xx</em>, ... (dot, dot, dot), <em class="emphasis">..</em>
 (dot, dot, space), or <em class="emphasis">..^G</em> (dot,
dot, Ctl-G).
</p>

<p>If any files with names like these are found, suspect a break-in.
(Remember that one directory named <tt class="literal">.</tt> and one
directory named <tt class="literal">..</tt> are in every directory except
the root directory.) Examine the contents of any suspicious files and
follow your normal incident-reporting procedures.
</p>

<p>You should also examine certain key files if you suspect a security
problem:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2720" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.conf</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Check the names of the programs started from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> file or the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/xinetd.conf</em> file if your system uses
<tt class="literal">xinetd</tt>. In particular, make sure that it does not
start any shell programs (e.g., <em class="emphasis">/bin/csh</em>). Also
check the programs that are started by <tt class="literal">inetd</tt> or by
<tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> to make sure the programs have not been
modified. <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/xinetd.conf</em> should not be world-writable.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">r command security files</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Check
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.equiv</em><a name="INDEX-2721" />,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.lpd</em><a name="INDEX-2722" />, and the
<em class="emphasis">.rhosts</em><a name="INDEX-2723" /> file in each user's home
directory to make sure they have not been improperly modified. In
particular, look for any plus sign (+) entries and any entries for
hosts outside of your local trusted network. These files should not
be world-writable. Better yet, remove the <tt class="literal">r</tt>
commands from your system and make sure no one reinstalls them.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2724" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Make sure that the <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> file has not been
modified. Look for new usernames and changes to the UID or GID of any
account. <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> should not be
world-writable.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Files run by</em> <tt class="literal">cron</tt> <em class="emphasis">or</em> <tt class="literal">at</tt></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Check all of the files run by
<tt class="literal">cron</tt><a name="INDEX-2725" /> or
<tt class="literal">at</tt><a name="INDEX-2726" />, looking for new files or
unexplained changes. Sometimes intruders use procedures run by
<tt class="literal">cron</tt> or <tt class="literal">at</tt> to readmit
themselves to the system, even after they have been kicked off.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Executable files</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Check all <a name="INDEX-2727" />executable files,
<a name="INDEX-2728" />binaries, and
<a name="INDEX-2729" />shell files to make sure they
have not been modified by the intruder. Executable files should not
be world-writable.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>If you find or even suspect a problem, follow your reporting
procedure and let people know about the problem. This is particularly
important if you are connected to a local area network. A problem on
your system could spread to other systems on the network.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-4.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.4.2.1. Checking files </h3>

<p>The <tt class="literal">find</tt> command is a
<a name="INDEX-2730" />
<a name="INDEX-2731" />powerful tool for detecting potential
filesystem security problems because it can search the entire
filesystem for files based on file permissions. Intruders often leave
behind setuid programs to grant themselves root access. The following
command searches for these files recursively, starting from the root
directory:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">find / -user root -perm -4000 -print</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>This <tt class="literal">find</tt> command starts searching at the root (/)
for files owned by the user root (<tt class="literal">-user</tt>
<tt class="literal">root</tt>) that have the setuid permission bit set
(<tt class="literal">-perm -4000</tt>). All matches found are displayed at
the terminal (<tt class="literal">-print</tt>). If any filenames are
displayed by <tt class="literal">find</tt>, closely examine the individual
files to make sure that these permissions are correct. As a general
rule, shell scripts should not have setuid permission.
</p>

<p>You can use the <tt class="literal">find</tt> command to check for other
problems that might open security holes for intruders. The other
common problems that <tt class="literal">find</tt> checks for are
world-writable files (<tt class="literal">-perm</tt>
<tt class="literal">-2</tt>), setgid files (<tt class="literal">-perm</tt>
<tt class="literal">-2000</tt>), and unowned files
(<tt class="literal">-nouser</tt> <tt class="literal">-o</tt>
<tt class="literal">-nogroup</tt>). World-writable and setgid files should
be checked to make sure that these permissions are appropriate. As a
general rule, files with names beginning with a dot (.) should not be
world-writable, and setgid permission, like setuid, should be avoided
for shell scripts.
</p>

<p>The process of scanning the filesystem can be automated with the
Tripwire program. A commercially supported version of Tripwire is
available from <a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com</a>,
and an open source version for Linux is available from
<a href="http://www.tripwire.org/">http://www.tripwire.org</a>. This
package not only scans the filesystem for problems, it computes
digital signatures to ensure that if any files are changed, the
changes will be detected.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-4.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.4.2.2. Checking login activity </h3>

<p>Strange <a name="INDEX-2732" />
<a name="INDEX-2733" /> <a name="INDEX-2734" />login activity (at odd
times of the day or from unfamiliar locations) can indicate attempts
by intruders to gain access to your system. We have already used the
<tt class="literal">who</tt> command to check who is currently logged into
the system. To check who has logged into the system in the past, use
the <tt class="literal">last</tt> command.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">last</tt><a name="INDEX-2735" /> command displays the contents of the
<em class="emphasis">wtmp</em> file.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-135">[135]</a> It is useful for learning normal login patterns and
detecting abnormal login activity. The <em class="emphasis">wtmp</em> file
keeps a historical record of who logged into the system, when they
logged in, what remote site they logged in from, and when they logged
out.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-135" /><p>[135]This file is
frequently stored in <em class="emphasis">/usr/adm</em>,
<em class="emphasis">/var/log</em>, or <em class="emphasis">/etc</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="ch12_04.html#tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-3">Figure 12-3</a> shows a single line of
<tt class="literal">last</tt> command output. The figure highlights the
fields that show the user who logged in, the device, the remote
location from which the login originated (if applicable), the day,
the date, the time logged in, the time logged out (if applicable),
and the elapsed time.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="81" alt="Figure 12-3" src="figs/tcp3_1203.gif" width="430" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-3. Last command output</h4>

<p>Simply typing <tt class="literal">last</tt> produces a large amount of
output because every login stored in <em class="emphasis">wtmp</em> is
displayed. To limit the output, specify a username or tty device on
the command line. This limits the display to entries for the
specified username or terminal. It is also useful to use
<tt class="literal">grep</tt> to search <tt class="literal">last</tt>'s
output for certain conditions. For example, the command below checks
for logins that occur on Saturday or Sunday:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">last | grep 'S[au]' | more</b> 
craig     console     :0            Sun Dec 15 10:33   still logged in 
reboot    system boot               Sat Dec 14 18:12 
root      console                   Sat Dec 14 18:14 
craig     pts/5       jerboas       Sat Dec 14 17:11 - 17:43  (00:32) 
craig     pts/2       172.16.12.24  Sun Dec  8 21:47 - 21:52  (00:05) 
       . 
       . 
--More--</pre></blockquote>

<p>The next example searches for root logins not originating from the
console. If you don't know who made the two logins reported in
this example, be suspicious:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">last root | grep -v console</b> 
root   pts/5   rodent.wrotethebook.com   Tue Oct 29 13:12 - down  (00:03)
root   ftp     crab.wrotethebook.com     Tue Sep 10 16:37 - 16:38  (00:00)</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">last</tt> command is a major source of information
about previous login activity. User logins at odd times or from odd
places are suspicious. Remote root logins should always be
discouraged. Use <tt class="literal">last</tt> to check for these problems.
</p>

<p>Report any security problems that you detect, or even suspect.
Don't be embarrassed to report a problem because it might turn
out to be a false alarm. Don't keep quiet because you might get
"blamed" for the security breach. Your silence will only
help the intruder.

<h3 class="sect2">12.4.3. Automated Monitoring </h3>

<p>Manually <a name="INDEX-2736" />monitoring your system
is time consuming and prone to errors and omissions. Fortunately,
several automated monitoring tools are available. At this writing,
the web site <a href="http://www.insecure.com/">http://www.insecure.com</a> lists the
monitoring tools that are currently most popular.
<a name="INDEX-2737" />Tripwire (mentioned earlier) is one
of them. Some other currently popular tools are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2738" /><dt><i>Nessus</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Nessus is a network-based security scanner that uses a client/server
architecture. Nessus scans target systems for a wide range of known
security problems.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>SATAN</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Security Auditing Tool for Analyzing Networks is the first
network-based security scanner that became widely distributed.
Somewhat outdated, it is still popular and can detect a wide range of
known security problems. SATAN has spawned some children, SAINT and
SARA, that are also popular.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2739" /><dt><i>SAINT</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>System Administrator's Integrated Network Tool scans systems

<a name="INDEX-2740" /><dt><i>SARA</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Security Auditor's Research Assistant is the third-generation
security scanner based on SATAN and SAINT. SARA detects a wide range
of known security problems.
</p>
</dd>

</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2745" /><dt><i>PortSentry</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>PortSentry detects port scans and can, in real time, block the system
initiating the scan. Port scans often precede a full-blown security
attack.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The biggest problem with security scanners and intrusion detection
tools is that they rapidly become outdated. New attacks emerge that
the tools are not equipped to detect. For this reason, this book does
not spend time describing the details of any specific scanner. These
are the currently popular scanners. By the time you read this, new
security tools or new versions of these tools may have taken their
place. Use this list as a starting point to search the Web for the
latest security tools.
</p>

<p>Well-informed users and administrators, good password security, and
good system monitoring are the foundation of network security. But
more is needed. That "more" is some technique for
controlling access to the systems connected to the network, or for
controlling access to the data the network carries. In the remainder
of this chapter, we look at various security techniques that control
access.
