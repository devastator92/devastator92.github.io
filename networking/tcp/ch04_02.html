<h2 class="sect1">4.2. Basic Information </h2>

<p>Regardless of whether you decide to connect your network to the
Internet, one thing is certain: you will build your enterprise
network using the TCP/IP protocols. All TCP/IP networks, whether or
not they connect to the Internet, require the same basic information
to configure the physical network interface. As we will see in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring the Interface "</a>, the network interface needs an IP address and
may also need a subnet mask and broadcast address. The decision of
whether to connect to the Internet affects how you obtain the values
needed to configure the interface. In this section, we look at how
the network administrator arrives at each of the required values.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.1. Obtaining an IP Address </h3>

<p>Every interface <a name="INDEX-814" />
<a name="INDEX-815" />on
a TCP/IP network must have a unique IP address. If a host is part of
the Internet, its IP address must be
<a name="INDEX-816" /> <a name="INDEX-817" />unique within the entire Internet. If a
host's TCP/IP communications are limited to a local network,
its IP address only needs to be unique locally. Administrators whose
networks will not be connected to the Internet can select an address
from <a name="INDEX-818" />RFC 1918,
<em class="emphasis">Address Allocation for Private Intranets</em>, which
lists network numbers that are reserved for private use.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-34">[34]</a> The private network numbers are:
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-34" /><p>[34]The address used in this book (172.16.0.0) is treated as an
official address, but it is a private network number set aside for
use by non-connected enterprise networks. Feel free to use this
address on your network if it will not be connected to the
Internet.</p> </blockquote>

<ul><li>
<p>Network 10.0.0.0 (10/8 prefix) is a 24-bit block of addresses.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Networks 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0 (172.16/12 prefix) is a 20-bit
block of addresses.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Networks 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.0 (192.168/16 prefix) is a 16-bit
block of addresses.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The disadvantage of using a network address from RFC 1918 is that you
may have to change your address in the future if you connect your
full network to the Internet. The advantages to choosing a private
network address are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>It's easy. You do not have to apply for an official address or
get anyone's approval.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It's friendly. You save address space for those who need to
connect to the Internet.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It's free. RFC 1918 addresses cost nothing -- official
addresses cost money.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you do choose an address from RFC 1918, the hosts on your network
can still have access to systems on the Internet. But it will take
some effort. You'll need a <em class="emphasis">network address
translation</em> (NAT) box or a proxy server. NAT
<a name="INDEX-819" />
<a name="INDEX-820" /> <a name="INDEX-821" />is
available as a separate piece of hardware or as an optional piece of
software in some routers and firewalls. It works by converting the
source address of datagrams leaving your network from your private
address to your official address. Address translation has several
advantages:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>It conserves IP addresses. Most network connections are between
systems on the same enterprise network. Only a small percentage of
systems need to connect to the Internet at any one time. Therefore,
far fewer official IP addresses are needed than the total number of
systems on an enterprise network. NAT makes it possible for you to
use a large address space from RFC 1918 for configuring your
enterprise network while using only a small official address space
for Internet connections.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It reduces
<a name="INDEX-822" />
<a name="INDEX-823" />
<a name="INDEX-824" />address spoofing, a security attack
in which a remote system pretends to be a local system. The addresses
in RFC 1918 cannot be routed over the Internet. Therefore, even if a
datagram is routed off your network toward the remote system, the
fact that the datagram contains an RFC 1918 destination address means
that the routers in the Internet will discard the datagram as a
<em class="emphasis">martian</em><a name="INDEX-825" />
<a name="INDEX-826" />.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-35">[35]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-35" /><p>[35]A martian is a datagram with an address that is known to be
invalid.</p> </blockquote>
</li><li>
<p>It eliminates the need to renumber your hosts when you connect to the
Internet.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Network address translation also has disadvantages:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Cost</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>NAT may <a name="INDEX-827" />add cost for new hardware or
optional software. However, these costs tend to be very low.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Performance</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Address <a name="INDEX-828" />translation adds overhead to the
processing of every datagram. When the address is changed, the
checksum must be recalculated. Furthermore, some upper-layer
protocols carry a copy of the IP address that also must be converted.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Reliability</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Routers <a name="INDEX-829" />never modify the addresses in a
datagram header, but NAT does. This might introduce some instability.
Additionally, protocols and applications that embed addresses in
their data may not function correctly with NAT.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Security</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>NAT <a name="INDEX-830" />limits the use of end-to-end
encryption and authentication. Authentication schemes that include
the header within the calculation do not work because the router
changes the addresses in the header. Encryption does not work if the
encrypted data includes the source address.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Proxy servers provide <a name="INDEX-831" /> <a name="INDEX-832" />many of the same advantages as NAT
boxes. In fact, these terms are often used interchangeably. But there
are differences. Proxy servers are application gateways originally
created as part of firewall systems to improve security. Internal
systems connect to the outside world through the proxy server, and
external systems respond to the proxy server. Proxy servers are
application-specific. A network might have one proxy web server and
another proxy FTP server -- each server dedicated to serving
connections for one type of application. Therefore, the difference
between NAT boxes and proxy servers is that NAT maps IP addresses
regardless of the application; the true proxy server focuses on one
application.
</p>

<p>Proxy servers often have added
<a name="INDEX-833" /> <a name="INDEX-834" />security
features. Address translation can be done at the IP layer. Proxy
services require the server to handle data up to the application
layer. Security filters can be put in proxy servers that filter data
at all layers of the protocol stack.
</p>

<p>Given the differences discussed here, network address translation
<a name="INDEX-835" />
<a name="INDEX-836" />
<a name="INDEX-837" />servers
should scale better than proxy servers, and proxy servers should
provide better security. However, over time these technologies have
merged and are now largely indistinguishable. Before you decide to
use either NAT or proxy services, make sure they are suitable for
your network needs.
</p>

<p>Combining NAT with a private network address gives every host on your
network access to the outside world, but it does not allow outside
users access into your network. For that, you need to obtain an
official <a name="INDEX-838" /> <a name="INDEX-839" />IP address.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.2.1.1. Obtaining an official network address</h3>

<p>Networks that are <a name="INDEX-840" /> <a name="INDEX-841" /> <a name="INDEX-842" />fully
connected to the Internet must obtain official network addresses. An
official address is needed for every system on your network that is
<em class="emphasis">directly</em> accessible to remote Internet hosts.
Every network that communicates with the Internet, even those that
use NAT, have at least one official address, although that address
may not be permanently assigned. The first step toward obtaining a
block of addresses is to determine how many addresses you need.
</p>

<p>Determining your "organizational type" helps you assess
your address needs and how you should satisfy those needs.
<a name="INDEX-843" />RFC 2901,
<em class="emphasis">Administrative Internet Infrastructure Guide</em>,
describes four different organizational types:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Internet end user</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A small- to <a name="INDEX-844" /> <a name="INDEX-845" />medium-sized organization focused on
connecting itself to the Internet. This could be as small as a single
user connecting to the Internet with a dynamic address assigned by
the ISP's DHCP server, or as large as a network of thousands of
hosts using NAT on the enterprise network and official addresses on a
limited number of publicly accessible systems. What categorizes this
organizational type is that it wants to use the Internet while
limiting the number of systems it makes available to remote users.
"Internet end user" organizations obtain official
addresses from their ISP. From the point of view of the Internet, all
Internet end user organizations appear small because they use only a
limited number of official addresses.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">High-volume end user</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A medium-sized <a name="INDEX-846" />to large organization that
distributes official addresses to systems throughout its network.
This type of organization tends to have a distributed management
under which divisions within the overall organization are allowed to
make systems remotely accessible. "High-volume end user"
organizations usually satisfy their address requirements through
their ISP or a Local Internet Registry. If the organization needs
more than 8,000 addresses, it may go directly to a Regional Internet
Registry. While in reality a high-volume end user organization may
not be any larger than an Internet end user organization, it appears
to be larger from the point of view of the Internet because it
exposes more systems to the Internet.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Internet Service Provider</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>An organization <a name="INDEX-847" />that provides Internet
connection services to other organizations and provides those
organizations with official addresses. Even an ISP connects to the
Internet in some way. If it connects through another ISP, that ISP is
its <em class="emphasis">upstream provider</em>. The upstream provider
assigns addresses to the ISP. If it connects directly to a network
access point (NAP), as described in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>, the
ISP requests addresses from the Local Internet Registry or the
Regional Internet Registry.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Local Internet Registry</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>An organization <a name="INDEX-848" />that provides addresses to
ISPs. In effect, a Local Internet Registry is an organization that
provides addresses to other organizations that provide addresses. A
Local Internet Registry must obtain its addresses from a Regional
Internet Registry.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>RFC 2901 lists four organizational types in order to be thorough, but
most organizations are either Internet end users or high-volume end
users. In all likelihood, your organization is one of these, and you
will obtain all of your addresses from your ISP.
</p>

<p>Your ISP has been delegated authority over a group of network
addresses and should be able to assign you a network number. If your
local ISP cannot meet your needs, perhaps the ISP's upstream
provider can. Ask your local ISP who it receives service from and ask
that organization for an address. If all else fails, you may be
forced to go directly to an Internet registry. If you are forced to
take your request to a registry, you will need to take certain steps
before you make the application.
</p>

<p>You need to <a name="INDEX-849" />
<a name="INDEX-850" /> <a name="INDEX-851" />prepare a detailed network topology. The
topology must include a diagram that shows the physical layout of
your network and highlights its connections to the Internet. You
should include network engineering plans that, in addition to
diagramming the topology, describe:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Your routing plans, including the protocols you will use and any
constraints that forced your routing decisions.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Your subnetting
<a name="INDEX-852" />plans, including the mask you will use
and the number of networks and hosts you will have connected during
the next year. <a name="INDEX-853" />RFC
2050, <em class="emphasis">Internet Registry IP Allocation
Guidelines</em>, suggests the following details in your subnet
plan:
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A table listing all subnets.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The mask for each subnet. The use of variable-length subnet masks
(VLSMs) is strongly encouraged. VLSMs are described later in this
chapter under "Defining a Subnet Mask."
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The estimated number of hosts.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A descriptive remark explaining the purpose of each subnet.</p>
</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>The biggest challenge is accurately predicting your future
requirements for addresses. If you have previously been assigned an
address block, you may be required to provide a history of how that
address block was used. Even if it is not requested by the Internet
registry, a history can be a helpful tool for your own planning.
Additionally, you will be asked to prepare a network deployment plan.
This plan typically shows the number of hosts you currently have that
need official addresses and the number you expect to have in six
months, one year, and two years.
</p>

<p>One factor used to determine how much address space is needed is the
<em class="emphasis">expected utilization rate</em>. The
<a name="INDEX-854" />
<a name="INDEX-855" /> <a name="INDEX-856" />expected utilization rate is the number
of hosts assigned official addresses divided by the total number of
hosts possible for the network. The deployment plans must show the
number of hosts that will be assigned addresses over a two-year
period. The total number of possible hosts can be estimated from the
total number of employees in your organization and the number of
systems that have been traditionally deployed per employee. Clearly
you need to have a global knowledge of your organization and its
needs before applying for an official address assignment.
</p>

<p>In addition to providing <a name="INDEX-857" />documentation that justifies
the address request, obtaining an official address requires a formal
commitment of resources. Most address applications require at least
two contacts: an administrative contact and a technical contact. The
administrative contact should have the authority to deal with
administrative issues ranging from policy violations to billing
disputes. The technical contact must be a skilled technical person
who can deal with technical problems and answer technical questions.
The registries require that these contacts live in the same country
as the organization that they represent. You must provide the names,
addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of these people.
Don't kid yourself -- these are not honorary positions.
These people have targets on their backs when things go wrong.
</p>

<p>The registry includes this contact information in the
<tt class="literal">whois</tt><a name="INDEX-858" /> database, which provides publicly
available contact information about the people responsible for
networks. Once your name is in the <tt class="literal">whois</tt> database,
you're given a NIC handle, which is a unique identifier linked
to your <tt class="literal">whois</tt> database record. For example, my NIC
handle is <tt class="literal">cwh3</tt>. Many official applications request
your NIC handle.
</p>

<p>In addition to human resources, you need to commit computer
resources. You should have systems set up, running, and ready to
accept the new addresses before you apply for official <a name="INDEX-859" /> <a name="INDEX-860" /> <a name="INDEX-861" />addresses.
</p>

<p>When all of the background work is done, you're ready to
present your case to an Internet registry. A three-level bureaucracy
controls the allocation of IP addresses:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">IANA</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-862" />Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
allocates large blocks of addresses to regional Internet registries.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Regional Internet Registry</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-863" /> <a name="INDEX-864" />Regional Internet
Registries (IRs) have been given authority by the IANA to allocate
addresses within a large region of the world. There are three IRs:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">APNIC</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-865" />Asian Pacific Network Information Center
has address allocation authority for Asia and the Pacific region.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">ARIN</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-866" />American Registry for Internet Numbers
has address allocation authority for the Americas.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">RIPE</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Reseaux IP Europeens has address allocation authority for Europe.</p>
</dd>

</dl>
</dd>



<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Local Internet Registry</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Local IRs are given authority, either by IANA or by a regional IR, to
allocate addresses within a specific area. An example might be a
national registry or a registry created by a consortium of ISPs.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Regardless of how much address space you need, you should start at
the bottom of the hierarchy and work your way up. Always start with
your local ISP. If they cannot handle your needs, ask them if there
is a local IR that can help you. As a last resort, take your request
to the regional IR that serves your part of the world.
</p>

<p>If you're in the APNIC region, first fill out the membership
application. The APNIC membership application is available
<a name="INDEX-867" />at
<a href="http://www.apnic.net/member/application.html">http://www.apnic.net/member/application.html</a>.
Once you become a member of APNIC, you can request an address.
</p>

<p>ARIN does not require that you become a member before applying for an
address. If you're a high-volume end user, use the application
form at
<a href="http://www.arin.net/templates/networktemplate.txt">http://www.arin.net/templates/networktemplate.txt</a>
to apply for an address. If you're an ISP, use
<a href="http://www.arin.net/templates/isptemplate.txt">http://www.arin.net/templates/isptemplate.txt</a>.
In either case, send the completed application to
<em class="email">hostmaster@arin.net</em>.
</p>

<p>End user organization in the RIPE region must use a local IR. RIPE
only allocates addresses to local IRs that are members of RIPE. End
user organizations cannot apply to RIPE for address allocations. See
the document
<a href="ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-159.txt">ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-159.txt</a> for
more information.
</p>

<p>Regardless of where your network is located, the most important thing
to remember is that most organizations never have to go through this
process because they do not want to expose the bulk of their
computers to the Internet. For security reasons, they use private
address numbers for most systems and have only a limited number of
official IP addresses. That limited number of addresses can usually
be provided by a local ISP.

<h3 class="sect3">4.2.1.2. Obtaining an IN-ADDR.ARPA domain </h3>

<p>When you <a name="INDEX-868" />
<a name="INDEX-869" />
<a name="INDEX-870" /> <a name="INDEX-871" />
<a name="INDEX-872" />obtain
an official IP address, you should also apply for an
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain. This special domain is
sometimes called a <em class="emphasis">reverse</em>
<em class="emphasis">domain</em>. <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a> contains
more information about how the <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>
domain is set up and used, but basically the reverse domain maps
numeric IP addresses into domain names. This is the reverse of the
normal domain name lookup process, which converts domain names to
addresses. If your ISP provides your name service or assigned you an
address from a block of its own addresses, you may not need to apply
for an <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> domain on your own. Check
with your ISP <em class="emphasis">before</em> applying. If, however, you
obtain a block of addresses from a Regional Internet Registry, you
probably need to get your own <em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em>
domain. If you do need to get a reverse domain, you will register it
with the same organization from which you obtained your address
assignment.
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>For address blocks obtained from APNIC, use the
<a name="INDEX-873" />form
<a href="ftp://ftp.apnic.net/apnic/docs/in-addr-request">ftp://ftp.apnic.net/apnic/docs/in-addr-request</a>
and mail the completed form to

</li><li>
<p>For address blocks obtained from ARIN, use the form

and mail the completed form to
<em class="email">hostmaster@arin.net</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>For address blocks obtained from RIPE, a domain object needs to be
entered into the RIPE database. Mail the completed object to
<em class="email">auto-inaddr@ripe.net</em>.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>As an example, assume that your network is located in the RIPE
region. You would need to provide the information needed to create a
RIPE domain object for your network. The domain object for the RIPE
database illustrates the type of information that is required to
register a reverse domain. The RIPE <a name="INDEX-874" />database object has ten fields:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">domain:</em> </i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the <a name="INDEX-875" />domain name. How reverse domain names
are derived is described in detail in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a>,
but the name is essentially the address reversed with
<em class="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</em> added to the end. For our 172.16/16

addresses. Beyond these two restrictions, you're free to assign
host addresses in any way that seems reasonable to you.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-36" /><p>[36]The range of addresses is called the
<em class="emphasis">address space</em>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Network administrators usually assign host addresses in one of two
ways:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">One address at a time</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Each individual host is assigned an address, perhaps in sequential
order, through the address range.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Groups of addresses</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Blocks of addresses are delegated to departments within the
organization, which then assign the individual host addresses.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The assignment of groups of addresses is most common when the network
is subnetted and the address groups are divided along subnet
boundaries. But assigning blocks of addresses does not require
<a name="INDEX-885" />subnetting. It can be just an
organizational device for delegating authority. Delegating authority
for groups of addresses is often very convenient for large networks,
while small networks tend to assign host addresses one at a time. No
matter how addresses are assigned, someone must retain sufficient
central control to prevent duplication and to ensure that the
addresses are recorded correctly on the domain name servers.
</p>

<p>Addresses can be assigned statically or dynamically. Static
<a name="INDEX-886" />
<a name="INDEX-887" />assignment is handled through
manually configuring the boot file on the host computer. Dynamic
address assignment is always handled by a server, such as a DHCP
server. One advantage of dynamic address assignment is that the
server will not accidentally assign duplicate addresses. Thus,
dynamic address assignment is desirable not only because it reduces
the administrator's workload but also because it reduces
errors.
</p>

<p>Before installing a server for dynamic addressing, make sure it is
useful for your purposes. Dynamic PPP addressing is useful for
servers that handle many remote dial-in clients that connect for a
short duration. If the PPP server is used to connect various parts of
the enterprise network and has long-lived connections, dynamic
addressing is probably unnecessary. Likewise, the dynamic address
assignment features of DHCP are of most use if you have mobile
systems in your network that move between subnets and therefore need
to change addresses frequently. See <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring the Interface "</a> for
information on PPP, and <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a> and
<a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Local Network Services"</a> for details about DHCP.
</p>

<p>Clearly, you must make several decisions about obtaining and
assigning addresses. You also need to decide what bit mask will be
used with the address. In the next section we look at the subnet
mask, which changes how the address is interpreted.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.3. Defining the Subnet Mask </h3>

<p>As the <a name="INDEX-888" />
<a name="INDEX-889" />prefix number indicates, a network
address is assigned with a specific address mask. For example, the
prefix of 16 in the network address 172.16.0.0/16 means that ARIN
assigned our imaginary network the block of addresses defined by the
address 172.16.0.0 and the 16-bit mask 255.255.0.0.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-37">[37]</a> Unless
you have a reason to change the interpretation of your assigned
network number, you do not have to define a subnet mask. <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a> described the structure of IP addresses and
touched upon the reasons for subnetting. The decision to subnet is
commonly driven by topological or organizational considerations.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-37" /><p>[37]Even though 172.16.0.0 is an RFC 1918 private network number,
this text treats 172.16.0.0 as if it were an officially assigned
network number, for the sake of example.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The topological reasons for subnetting include:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Overcoming distance limitations</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some network
<a name="INDEX-890" />hardware
<a name="INDEX-891" />has very strict
distance limitations. The original 10 Mbps Ethernet is the most
common example. The maximum length of a "thick"
<a name="INDEX-892" /> <a name="INDEX-893" />Ethernet cable
is 500 meters; the maximum length of a "thin" cable is
300 meters; the total length of a 10 Mbps Ethernet, called the
maximum diameter, is 2500 meters.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-38">[38]</a> If you need to cover
a greater distance, you can use IP routers to link a series of
Ethernet cables. Individual cable still must not exceed the maximum
allowable length, but using this approach, every cable is a separate
Ethernet. Therefore the total length of the IP network can exceed the
maximum length of an Ethernet.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-38" /><p>[38]The faster the
Ethernet, the smaller its network diameter. For this reason,
high-speed Ethernet technologies use switches instead of a daisy
chain cable to connect nodes.</p> </blockquote>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Interconnecting dissimilar physical networks</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>IP routers can be
<a name="INDEX-894" />
<a name="INDEX-895" />used to link
networks that have different and incompatible underlying network
technologies. <a href="ch04_03.html#tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-1">Figure 4-1</a> later in this chapter
shows a central token ring subnet, 172.16.1.0, connecting two
Ethernet subnets, 172.16.6.0 and 172.16.12.0.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Filtering traffic between networks</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Local traffic
<a name="INDEX-896" />stays on the local subnet. Only
traffic intended for other networks is forwarded through the gateway.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Subnetting is not the only way to solve topology problems. Networks
are implemented in hardware and can be altered by changing or adding
hardware, but subnetting is an effective way to overcome these
problems at the TCP/IP level.
</p>

<p>Of course, there are non-technical reasons for creating subnets.
Subnets often serve organizational
<a name="INDEX-897" />purposes such as:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Simplifying network administration</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Subnets can be used to delegate address management, troubleshooting,
and other network administration responsibilities to smaller groups
within the overall organization. This is an effective tool for
managing a large network with a limited staff. It places the
responsibility for managing the subnet on the people who benefit from
its use.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Recognizing organizational structure</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The structure of an organization (or simply office politics) may
require independent network management for some divisions. Creating
independently managed subnets for these divisions is preferable to
having them go directly to an ISP to get their own independent
network numbers.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Isolating traffic by organization</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Certain organizations may prefer to have their local traffic isolated
to a network that is primarily accessible only to members of that
organization. This is particularly appropriate when security is
involved. For example, the payroll department might not want its
network packets on the engineering network where some clever person
could figure out how to intercept them.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Isolating potential problems</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>If a certain segment is less reliable than the remainder of the net,
you may want to make that segment a subnet. For example, if the
research group puts experimental systems on the network from time to
time or experiments with the network itself, this part of the network
will be unstable. You would make it a subnet to prevent experimental
hardware or software from interfering with the rest of the network.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The network administrator decides if subnetting is required and
defines the subnet mask for the network. The subnet mask has the same
form as an IP address mask. As described in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>, it defines which bits form the "network
part" of the address and which bits form the "host
part." Bits in the "network part" are turned on
(i.e., 1) while bits in the "host part" are turned off
(i.e., 0).
</p>

<p>The subnet mask used on our imaginary network is 255.255.255.0. This
mask sets aside 8 bits to identify subnets, which creates 256
subnets. The <em class="emphasis">network</em> administrator has decided
that this mask provides enough subnets and that the individual
subnets have enough hosts to effectively use the address space of 254
hosts per subnet. The upcoming <a href="ch04_03.html#tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-1">Figure 4-1</a> shows an
example of this type of subnetting. Applying this subnet mask to the
addresses 172.16.1.0 and 172.16.12.0 causes them to be interpreted as
the addresses of two different networks, not as two different hosts
on the same network.
</p>

<p>Once a mask <a name="INDEX-898" />
<a name="INDEX-899" />is defined, it must be
disseminated to all hosts on the network. There are two ways this is
done: manually, through the configuration of network interfaces, and
automatically, through configuration protocols like DHCP. Routing
protocols can distribute subnet masks, but in most environments host
systems do not run routing protocols. In this case, every device on
the network must use the same subnet mask because every computer
believes that the entire network is subnetted in exactly the same way
as its local subnet.
</p>

<p>Because routing protocols distribute address masks for each
destination, it is possible to use <a name="INDEX-900" />variable-length
subnet masks (VLSMs). Using variable-length subnet masks increases
the flexibility and power of subnetting. Assume you wanted to divide
192.168.5.0/24 into three networks: one network of 110 hosts, one
network of 50 hosts, and one network of 60 hosts. Using traditional
subnet masks, a single subnet mask would have to be chosen and
applied to the entire address space. At best, this would be a
compromise. With variable-length subnet masks you could use a mask of
255.255.255.128 to create subnets of 126 hosts for the large subnet,
and a mask of 255.255.255.192 to create subnets of 62 hosts for the
smaller subnets. VLSMs, however, require that every router on the
network knows how to store and use the masks and runs routing
protocols that can transmit them. (See <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Configuring Routing "</a>
for more information on routing.) Routing is an essential part of a
TCP/IP network. Like other key components of your network, routing
should be planned before you start <a name="INDEX-901" />
<a name="INDEX-902" />configuration.
