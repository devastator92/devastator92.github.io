<p>Hosts attached to a network -- particularly the worldwide
Internet -- are exposed to a wider range of security threats than
are unconnected hosts. Network security reduces the risks of
connecting to a network. But by nature, network access and computer
security work at cross-purposes. A network is a data highway designed
to increase access to computer systems, while security is designed to
control access to those systems. Providing network security is a
balancing act between open access and security.
</p>

<p>The highway analogy is very appropriate. Like a highway, the network
provides equal access for all -- welcome visitors as well as
unwelcome intruders. At home, you provide security for your
possessions by locking your house, not by blocking the streets.
Likewise, network security requires adequate security on individual
host computers. Simply securing the network with a firewall is not
enough.
</p>

<p>In very small towns where people know each other, doors are often
left unlocked. But in big cities, doors have deadbolts and chains.
The Internet has grown from a small town of a few thousand users into
a big city of millions of users. Just as the anonymity of a big city
turns neighbors into strangers, the growth of the Internet has
reduced the level of trust between network neighbors. The
ever-increasing need for computer security is an unfortunate side
effect. Growth, however, is not all bad. In the same way that a big
city offers more choices and more services, the expanded network
provides increased services. For most of us, security consciousness
is a small price to pay for network access.
</p>

<p>Network break-ins have increased as the network has grown and become
more impersonal, but it is easy to exaggerate the extent of these
security breaches. Overreacting to the threat of break-ins may hinder
the way you use the network. Don't make the cure worse than the
disease. The best advice about network security is to use common
sense. RFC 1244, now replaced by RFC 2196, stated this principle very
well:
</p>


<p>Common sense is the most appropriate tool that can be used to
establish your security policy. Elaborate security schemes and
mechanisms are impressive, and they do have their place, yet there is
little point in investing money and time on an elaborate
implementation scheme if the simple controls are forgotten.
</p>


<p>This chapter emphasizes the simple controls that can be used to
increase your network's security. A reasonable approach to
security, based on the level of security required by your system, is
the most cost-effective -- both in terms of actual expense and in
terms of productivity.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">12.1. Security Planning </h2>

<p>One of the most
<a name="INDEX-2615" /></a>important network security tasks, and
probably one of the least enjoyable, is developing a network security
policy. Most computer people want a technical solution to every
problem. We want to find a program that "fixes" the
network security problem. Few of us want to write a paper on network
security policies and procedures. However, a well-thought-out
security plan will help you decide what needs to be protected, how
much you are willing to invest in protecting it, and who will be
responsible for carrying out the steps to protect it.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.1. Assessing the Threat </h3>

<p>The first step
<a name="INDEX-2616" /></a> <a name="INDEX-2617" /></a>toward developing an
effective network security plan is to assess the threat that
connection presents to your systems. <a name="INDEX-2618" /></a>RFC 2196, <em class="emphasis">Site Security
Handbook</em>, identifies three distinct types of security
threats usually associated with network connectivity:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Unauthorized access</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A break-in by an unauthorized person.</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Disclosure of information</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any problem that causes the disclosure of valuable or sensitive
information to people who should not have access to the information.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Denial of service (DoS)</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any problem that makes it difficult or impossible for the system to
continue to perform productive work.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Assess these threats in relation to the number of users who would be
affected, as well as to the sensitivity of the information that might
be compromised. For some organizations, break-ins are an
embarrassment that can undermine the confidence that others have in
the organization. Intruders tend to target government and academic
organizations that will be embarrassed by the break-in. But for most
organizations, unauthorized access is not a major problem unless it
involves one of the other threats: disclosure of information or
denial of service.
</p>

<p>Assessing the threat of <a name="INDEX-2619" /></a>information disclosure depends
on the type of information that could be compromised. While no system
with highly classified information should ever be directly connected
to the Internet, systems with other types of sensitive information
might be connected without undue hazard. In most cases, files such as
personnel and medical records, corporate plans, and credit reports
can be adequately protected by network access controls and standard
Unix file security procedures. However, if the risk of liability in
case of disclosure is great, the host may choose not to be connected
to the Internet.
</p>

<p>Denial of <a name="INDEX-2620" /></a>service <a name="INDEX-2621" /></a>can be a severe problem if it
impacts many users or a major mission of your organization. Some
systems can be connected to the network with little concern. The
benefit of connecting individual workstations and small servers to
the Internet generally outweighs the chance of having service
interrupted for the individuals and small groups served by these
systems. Other systems may be vital to the survival of your
organization. The threat of losing the services of a mission-critical
system must be evaluated seriously before connecting such a system to
the network.
</p>

<p>An insidious aspect of DoS appears when your system becomes an
unwitting tool of the attackers. Through unauthorized access,
intruders can place malicious software on your system in order to use
your system as a launching pad for attacks on others. This is most
often associated with Microsoft systems, but any type of computer
system can be a victim. Preventing your system from becoming a tool
of evil is an important reason for protecting it.
</p>

<p>In his class on computer security, Brent Chapman classifies
information security threats into three categories: threats to the
secrecy, to the availability, and to the integrity of data. Secrecy
is the need to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information.
Availability means that you want information and information
processing resources available when they are needed; a
denial-of-service attack disrupts availability. The need for the
integrity of information is equally obvious, but its link to computer
security is more subtle. Once someone has gained unauthorized access
to a system, the integrity of the information on that system is in
doubt. Some intruders just want to compromise the integrity of data;
we are all familiar with cases where web vandals gain access to a web
server and change the data on the server in order to embarrass the
organization that runs the web site. Thinking about the impact
network threats have on your data can make it easier to assess the
threat.
</p>

<p>Network threats are not, of course, the only threats to computer
security, or the only reasons for denial of service. Natural
disasters and internal threats (threats from people who have
legitimate access to a system) are also serious. Network security has
had a lot of publicity, so it's a fashionable thing to worry
about, but more computer time has probably been lost because of fires
and power outages than has ever been lost because of network security
problems. Similarly, more data has probably been improperly disclosed
by authorized users than by unauthorized break-ins. This book
naturally emphasizes network security, but network security is only
part of a larger security plan that includes physical security and
disaster recovery plans.
</p>

<p>Many traditional (non-network) security threats are handled, in part,
by physical security. Don't forget to provide an adequate level
of physical security for your network equipment and cables. Again,
the investment in physical security should be based on your realistic
assessment of the threat.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.2. Distributed Control </h3>

<p>One approach
<a name="INDEX-2622" /></a>to network security is to
distribute the responsibility for and control over different segments
of a large network to small groups within the organization. This
approach involves a large number of people in security and runs
counter to the school of thought that seeks to increase security by
centralizing control. However, distributing responsibility and
control to small groups can create an environment of small, easily
monitored networks composed of a known user community. Using the
analogy of small towns and big cities, it is similar to creating a
neighborhood watch to reduce risks by giving people connections with
their neighbors, mutual responsibility for one another, and control
over their own fates.
</p>

<p>Additionally, distributing security responsibilities formally
recognizes one of the realities of network security -- most
security actions take place on individual systems. The managers of
these systems must know that they are responsible for security and
that their contribution to network security is recognized and
appreciated. If people are expected to do a job, they must be
empowered to do it.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-1.2.1" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.1.2.1. Use subnets to distribute control </h3>

<p>Subnets are
<a name="INDEX-2623" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2624" /></a>a possible tool for distributing
network control. A subnet administrator should be appointed when a
subnet is created. The administrator is then responsible for the
security of the network and for assigning IP addresses to the devices
connected to the networks. Assigning IP addresses gives the subnet
administrator some control over who connects to the subnet. It also
helps to ensure that the administrator knows each system that is
connected and who is responsible for that system. When the subnet
administrator gives a system an IP address, he also delegates certain
security responsibilities to the system's administrator.
Likewise, when the system administrator grants a user an account, the
user takes on certain security responsibilities.
</p>

<p>The hierarchy of responsibility flows from the network administrator
to the subnet administrator to the system administrator and finally
to the user. At each point in this hierarchy the individuals are
given responsibilities and the power to carry them out. To support
this structure, it is important for users to know what they are
responsible for and how to carry out that responsibility. The network
security policy described in the next section provides this
information.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-1.2.2" /></a><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.1.2.2. Use the network to distribute information </h3>

<p>If your site adopts distributed control, you must develop a system
for disseminating security information to each group. Mailing lists
for each administrative level can be used for alerts and other
real-time information. An internal web site can be used to provide
policy, background, and archival information as well as links to
important security sites.
</p>

<p>The network <a name="INDEX-2625" /></a>administrator receives security
information from outside authorities, filters out irrelevant
material, and forwards the relevant material to the subnet
administrators. Subnet administrators forward the relevant parts to
their system administrators, who in turn forward what they consider
important to the individual users. The filtering of information at
each level ensures that individuals get the information they need
without receiving too much. If too much unnecessary material is
distributed, users begin to ignore everything they receive.
</p>

<p>At the top of this information structure is the information that the
network administrator receives from outside authorities. In order to
receive this, the network administrator should join the appropriate
mailing lists and newsgroups and browse the appropriate web sites. A
few places
<a name="INDEX-2626" /></a>to start looking for computer
security information are the following:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Your Unix vendor</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Many <a name="INDEX-2627" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2628" /></a>vendors have their own security
information mailing lists. Most vendors also have a security page on
their web sites. Place a link on your internal web site to the vendor
information that you find important and useful.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">The Bugtraq archive</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Bugtraq <a name="INDEX-2629" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2630" /></a>reports on
software bugs, some of which are exploited by intruders. Knowing
about these bugs and the fixes for them is the single most important
thing you can do to improve system security. Bugtraq is widely
available on the Web. Two sites I use are
<a href="http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq">http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq</a> and
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/">http://www.securityfocus.com</a>, which provide
access to a wide range of security information.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Security newsgroups</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-2631" /></a><em class="emphasis">comp.security</em>
newsgroups -- <em class="emphasis">comp.security.unix</em>,
<em class="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls</em>,
<em class="emphasis">comp.security.announce</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">comp.security.misc</em> -- contain some useful
information. Like most newsgroups, they also contain lots of
unimportant and uninteresting material. But they do contain an
occasional gem.

<h3 class="sect2">12.1.3. Writing a Security Policy </h3>

<p>Security is
<a name="INDEX-2643" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-2644" /></a>largely a "people
problem." People, not computers, are responsible for
implementing security procedures, and people are responsible when
security is breached. Therefore, network security is ineffective
unless people know their responsibilities. It is important to write a
security policy that clearly states what is expected and from whom. A
network security policy should define:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">The network user's security responsibilities</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The policy may require users to change their passwords at certain
intervals, to use passwords that meet certain guidelines, or to
perform certain checks to see if their accounts have been accessed by
someone else. Whatever is expected from users, it is important that
it be clearly defined.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">The system administrator's security responsibilities</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The policy may require that every host use specific security
measures, login banner messages, or monitoring and accounting
procedures. It might list applications that should not be run on any
host attached to the network.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">The proper use of network resources</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Define who can use network resources, what things they can do, and
what things they should not do. If your organization takes the
position that email, files, and histories of computer activity are
subject to security monitoring, tell the users very clearly that this
is the policy.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">The actions taken when a security problem is detected</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>What should be done when a security problem is detected? Who should
be notified? It is easy to overlook things during a crisis, so you
should have a detailed list of the exact steps that a system
administrator or user should take when a security breach is detected.
This could be as simple as telling the users to "touch nothing,
and call the network security officer." But even these simple
actions should be in the written policy so that they are readily
available.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Connecting to the Internet brings with it certain security
responsibilities. <a name="INDEX-2645" /></a>RFC 1281, <em class="emphasis">A Guideline for the
Secure Operation of the Internet</em>, provides guidance for
users and network administrators on how to use the Internet in a
secure and responsible manner. Reading this RFC will provide insight
into the information that should be in your security policy.
</p>

<p>A great deal of thought is necessary to produce a complete network
security policy. The outline shown above describes the contents of a
network policy document, but if you are personally responsible for
writing a policy, you may want more detailed guidance. I recommend
that you read RFC 2196, which is a very good guide for developing a
security plan.
</p>

<p>Security planning (assessing the threat, assigning security
responsibilities, and writing a security policy) is the basic
building block of network security, but the plan must be implemented
before it can have any effect. In the remainder of this chapter,
we'll turn our attention to implementing basic security
procedures.
