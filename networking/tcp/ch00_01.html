<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>


<p>The first edition of <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network
Administration</em> was written in 1992. In the decade since,
many things have changed, yet some things remain the same. TCP/IP is
still the preeminent communications protocol for linking together
diverse computer systems. It remains the basis of interoperable data
communications and global computer networking. The underlying
Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol, and User
Datagram Protocol (UDP) are remarkably unchanged. But change has come
in the way TCP/IP is used and how it is managed.
</p>

<p>A clear symbol of this change is the fact that my mother-in-law has a
TCP/IP network connection in her home that she uses to exchange
electronic mail, compressed graphics, and hypertext documents with
other senior citizens. She thinks of this as "just being on the
Internet," but the truth is that her small system contains a
functioning TCP/IP protocol stack, manages a dynamically assigned IP
address, and handles data types that did not even exist a decade ago.
</p>

<p>In 1991, TCP/IP was a tool of sophisticated users. Network
administrators managed a limited number of systems and could count on
the users for a certain level of technical knowledge. No more. In
2002, the need for highly trained network administrators is greater
than ever because the user base is larger, more diverse, and less
capable of handling technical problems on its own. This book provides
the information needed to become an effective TCP/IP network
administrator.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network Administration</em> was the first book
of practical information for the professional TCP/IP network
administrator, and it is still the best. Since the first edition was
published there has been an explosion of books about TCP/IP and the
Internet. Still, too few books concentrate on what a system
administrator really needs to know about TCP/IP administration. Most
books are either scholarly texts written from the point of view of
the protocol designer, or instructions on how to use TCP/IP
applications. All of those books lack the practical, detailed network
information needed by the Unix system administrator. This book
strives to focus on TCP/IP and Unix and to find the right balance of
theory and practice.
</p>

<p>I am proud of the earlier editions of <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network
Administration</em>. In this edition, I have done everything I
can to maintain the essential character of the book while making it
better. Dynamic address assignment based on Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is covered. The Domain Name System
material has been updated to cover BIND 8 and, to a lesser extent,
BIND 9. The email configuration is based on current version of
sendmail 8, and the operating system examples are from the current
versions of Solaris and Linux. The routing protocol coverage includes
Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2), Open Shortest Path
First (OSPF), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). I have also added a
chapter on Apache web server configuration, new material on
<tt class="literal">xinetd</tt>, and information about building a firewall
with <tt class="literal">iptables</tt>. Despite the additional topics, the
book has been kept to a reasonable length.
</p>

<p>TCP/IP is a set of communications protocols that define how different
types of computers talk to each other. <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network
Administration</em> is a book about building your own network
based on TCP/IP. It is both a tutorial covering the "why"
and "how" of TCP/IP networking, and a reference manual
for the details about specific network programs.
</p>


<div class="sect1"><a name="tcp3-PREF-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Audience</h2>

<p>This book is intended for everyone who has a Unix computer connected
to a TCP/IP network.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> This
obviously includes the network managers and the system administrators
who are responsible for setting up and running computers and
networks, but it also includes any user who wants to understand how
his or her computer communicates with other systems. The distinction
between a "system administrator" and an "end
user" is a fuzzy one. You may think of yourself as an end user,
but if you have a Unix workstation on your desk, you're
probably also involved in system administration tasks.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p>[1]Much of this text also applies
to non-Unix systems. Many of the file formats and commands and all of
the protocol descriptions apply equally well to Windows 9x, Windows
NT/2000, and other operating systems. If you're an NT
administrator, you should read <em class="emphasis">Windows NT TCP/IP Network
Administration</em> (O'Reilly).</p> </blockquote>

<p>Over the last several years there has been a rash of books for
"dummies" and "idiots." If you really think
of yourself as an "idiot" when it comes to Unix, this
book is not for you. Likewise, if you are a network administration
"genius," this book is probably not suitable either. If
you fall anywhere between these two extremes, however, you'll
find this book has a lot to offer.
</p>

<p>This book assumes that you have a good understanding of computers and
their operation and that you're generally familiar with Unix
system administration. If you're not, the Nutshell Handbook
<em class="emphasis">Essential System Administration</em> by &AElig;leen
Frisch (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates) will fill you
in on the basics.
