<h2 class="sect1">4.4. Planning Naming Service </h2>

<p>To make your network user-friendly, you need to provide a service to
convert hostnames into IP addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) and
the host table, explained in <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a>, perform
this function. You should plan to use both.
</p>

<p>To configure a computer, a network user needs to know the domain
name, the system's hostname, and the hostname and address of at
least one name server. The network administrator provides this
information.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.1. Obtaining a Domain Name </h3>

<p>The first <a name="INDEX-928" /> <a name="INDEX-929" />item you
need for name service is a domain name. Your ISP may be willing to
get one for you or to assign you a name within its domain; however,
it is likely that you will have to apply for a domain name yourself.
You can buy an official domain name from a domain name registrar.
</p>

<p>Your domain is not part of the official domain name space until it is
registered. Only certain organizations are permitted to officially
register a domain name. You need to locate an official registrar and
obtain its services to register your domain. The place to start is
<a name="INDEX-930" />either
<a href="http://www.icann.org/">http://www.icann.org</a> or
<a href="http://www.internic.net/">http://www.internic.net</a>. Both of these sites
provide listings of official registrars.
</p>

<p>ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers<a name="INDEX-931" />, a nonprofit organization created
to take over management of some functions previously managed through
U.S. government contractors. ICANN oversees the domain name
registrars. The ICANN web site provides pointers to various
international registrars.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.internic.net/">http://www.internic.net</a> is a U.S. government web
site designed to point users to official gTLD registrars and to
answer any questions Internet users might have about the domain
registration process. The imaginary domain used in this book is
registered in <em class="emphasis">.com</em>. For
<em class="emphasis">.org</em>, <em class="emphasis">.com</em>, or
<em class="emphasis">.net</em> domains, this is a good place to start.
<a href="ch04_04.html#tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-2">Figure 4-2</a> shows part of the alphabetical list of
accredited registrars found at
<a href="http://www.internic.net/">http://www.internic.net</a>.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="352" alt="Figure 4-2" src="figs/tcp3_0402.gif" width="481" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-2. The registrar listing</h4>

<p>There is not much that differentiates registrars. Domain registration
is very inexpensive, usually less than $50 a year, so cost is not
much of a factor. Service is also difficult to determine because once
a domain is registered, it doesn't usually require any
maintenance. Some administrators like to choose a registrar located
close to home, but even this is not really significant in a wired
world. Use your own judgment. I frankly can't find anything to
recommend any individual registrar. In the following examples, I used
Network Solutions as the registrar, in part because they are located
a stone's throw away from my home. You, however, should choose
your own registrar.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.2. Registering a Domain</h3>

<p>Once you select <a name="INDEX-932" />a
registrar, go to its web site for instructions on registering a
domain. At <a href="http://www.internic.net/">http://www.internic.net</a>, simply
clicking the symbol of the registrar should take you to its web site.
ost registrars provide an online web form for registering your
domain name.
</p>

<p>For example, if you select Network Solutions from the list at
<a href="http://www.internic.net/">http://www.internic.net</a>, you go to
<a href="http://www.netsol.com/">http://www.netsol.com</a>. There, you are asked to
select a domain name. This first step searches the existing domain
database system to make sure that the name you want is available. If
it isn't, you're asked to choose another name. If the
name is available, you must provide information about the servers
that will be authoritative for the new domain. Some registrars,
including Network Solutions, will provide DNS service for your new
domain as an optional, extra-cost service. Because we plan to create
our own server for the <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> domain,
we will provide our own server information.
</p>

<p>First, you're asked to provide the name of the person legally
responsible for this domain. This information is used by the
registrar for billing purposes and is included in the
<tt class="literal">whois</tt> database that provides contact information
about the people responsible for domains. If you're already in
the <tt class="literal">whois</tt> database, you're asked to provide
your NIC handle, which is a unique identifier linked to your
<tt class="literal">whois</tt> database record. For example, my NIC handle
is <tt class="literal">cwh3</tt>.
</p>

<p>If you are a new customer, you're asked to provide the names
and addresses of the people who will be the administrative,
technical, and billing contacts. These can be three different people
or the same person, depending on how your business is organized.
</p>

<p>Next, the system prompts for the names and IP addresses of two
servers that will be authoritative for this domain. Enter the names
of the master and slave servers you have configured for your domain.
The servers should already be operational when you fill in this form.
If they aren't, you can pay a little extra and have Network
Solutions host your domain until your servers are ready. You
shouldn't enter the names of servers that aren't yet
ready to run because that will cause a lame delegation when the root
servers use this information to put pointers into the top-level
domain to servers that are not really authoritative. Either
preconfigure your servers, even with only minimal information, or pay
the somewhat higher fee to reserve your domain name until your
servers are ready.
</p>

<p>Check the information. Pay the bill. Now you're ready to run
your own domain.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.3. Choosing a Hostname </h3>

<p>Once you
<a name="INDEX-933" />have
a domain name, you are responsible for assigning hostnames within
that domain. You must ensure that hostnames are unique within your
domain or subdomain, in the same way that host addresses must be
unique within a network or subnet. But there is more to choosing a
hostname than just making sure the name is unique; it can be a
surprisingly emotional issue. Many people feel very strongly about
the name of their computer because they identify their computer with
themselves or their work.
</p>

<p>RFC 1178 provides excellent guidelines on how to choose a hostname.
Some key suggestions from these guidelines are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Use real words that are short, easy to spell, and easy to remember.
The point of using hostnames instead of IP addresses is that they are
easier to use. If hostnames are difficult to spell and remember, they
defeat their own purpose.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use theme names. For example, all hosts in a group could be named
after human movements: fall, jump, hop, skip, walk, run, stagger,
wiggle, stumble, trip, limp, lurch, hobble, etc. Theme names are
often easier to choose than unrestricted names and increase the sense
of community among network users.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Avoid using project names, personal names, acronyms, numeric names,
and technical jargon. Projects and users change over time. If you
name a computer after the person who is currently using it or the
project it is currently assigned to, you will probably have to rename
the computer in the future. Use nicknames to identify the server
function of a system, e.g., <em class="emphasis">www</em>,
<em class="emphasis">ftp</em>, <em class="emphasis">ns</em>, etc. Nicknames can
easily move between systems if the server function moves. See the
description of CNAME records in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a> for
information on creating nicknames.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The only requirement for a hostname is that it be unique within its
domain. But a well-chosen hostname can save future work and make the
user happier.
</p>

<p>Name service is the most basic network service, and it is one service
that you will certainly run on your network. There are, however,
other services that you should also include in your network planning
process.
