<h2 class="sect1">9.5. DHCP </h2>

<p>Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) was <a name="INDEX-2040" />
<a name="INDEX-2041" />the
first comprehensive <a name="INDEX-2042" />configuration
protocol. It provides all of the information commonly used to
configure TCP/IP, from the client's IP address to what print
server the client should use. BOOTP was simple and effective; so
effective, in fact, that it became the basis for Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP operates over the same UDP ports,
67 and 68, as BOOTP. It provides all of the services of BOOTP as well
as some important extensions. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
provides three important features:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Backward compatibility with Bootstrap Protocol</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A DHCP server can support BOOTP clients. Properly configured, a DHCP
server can support all of your clients.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Full configurations</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A DHCP server provides a complete set of TCP/IP configuration
parameters. (See <a href="appd_01.html">Appendix D, "A dhcpd Reference"</a> for a full list.) The
network administrator can handle the entire configuration for the
users.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Dynamic address assignments</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A DHCP server can provide permanent addresses manually, permanent
addresses automatically, and temporary addresses dynamically. The
network administrator can tailor the type of address to the needs of
the network and the client system.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>In this section we configure a DHCP server that supports BOOTP
clients, performs dynamic address allocation, and provides a wide
range of configuration parameters for its clients.
</p>

<p>Several implementations of DHCP are available for Unix systems. Some
are commercial packages and some run on a specific version of Unix.
We use the Internet Software Consortium (ISC) Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol Daemon (<tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt>). It is
freely available over the Internet and runs on a wide variety of Unix
systems, including both our Linux and Solaris sample systems. (See
<a href="appd_01.html">Appendix D, "A dhcpd Reference"</a> for information on downloading and
compiling <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt>.) If you use different DHCP server
software, it will have different configuration commands, but it will
probably perform the same basic functions.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.5.1. dhcpd.conf </h3>

<p><tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> reads its <a name="INDEX-2043" />
<a name="INDEX-2044" />configuration from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/dhcpd.conf</em><a name="INDEX-2045" /> file. The configuration file contains the
instructions that tell the server what subnets and hosts it services
and what configuration information it should provide them.
<em class="emphasis">dhcpd.conf</em> is an ASCII text file that is similar
to a C language source file. The easiest way to learn about the
<em class="emphasis">dhcpd.conf</em> file is to look at a sample:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Define global values that apply to all systems.

<p>This sample configuration file defines a server that is connecting to
and serving two separate subnets. It assigns IP addresses dynamically
to the DHCP clients on each subnet and supports a few BOOTP clients.
All of the lines that begin with a sharp sign (#) are comments. The
first few real configuration lines in the file specify a set of
parameters and options that apply to all of the subnets and clients
served. The first three lines are parameters, which provide direction
to the server. All three of the sample parameters define some aspect
of how <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> <a name="INDEX-2046" />
<a name="INDEX-2047" />should handle dynamic address
assignments.
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2048" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">default-lease-time</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Tells the server how many seconds long a default address lease should
be. The client can request that the address be leased for a specific
period of time. If it does, it is assigned the address for that
period of time, given some restrictions. Frequently, clients do not
request a specific lifetime for an address lease. When that happens,
the default-lease-time is used. In the example, the default lease is
set to one day (86400 seconds).
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2049" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">max-lease-time</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the upper limit for how long an address can be leased.
Regardless of the length of time requested by the client, this is the
longest address lease that <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> will grant. The
life of the lease is specified in seconds. In the example here, it is
one week.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2050" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">get-lease-hostnames</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Directs <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> to provide a hostname to each client
that is assigned a dynamic address. Further, the hostname is to be
obtained from DNS. This parameter is a Boolean. If it is set to
false, which is the default, the client receives an address but no
hostname. Looking up the hostname for every possible dynamic address
adds substantial time to the startup. Set this to false. Set it to
true only if the server handles a very small number of dynamic
addresses.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The configuration file uses a few more parameters that will be
explained as we go. For a complete list of all DHCP parameters, see
<a href="appd_01.html">Appendix D, "A dhcpd Reference"</a>.
</p>

<p>The next four lines are options. The options all start with the
keyword <tt class="literal">option</tt>. The keyword is followed by the
name of the option and the value assigned to the option. Options
define configuration values that are used by the client.
</p>

<p>The meanings of the sample options are easy to deduce. The option
names are very descriptive. We are providing the clients with the
subnet mask, domain name, domain name server addresses, and print
server address. These values are similar to those that could have
been provided with the old BOOTP service.
</p>

<p>DHCP, however, can do more than BOOTP. For sake of illustration, we
also define the maximum transmission unit (<a name="INDEX-2051" />MTU). The sample
<tt class="literal">interface-mtu</tt> option tells the client that the MTU
is 1500 bytes. In this case, the option is not needed because 1500
bytes is the default for Ethernet. However, it illustrates the point
that DHCP can provide a very complete set of configuration
information.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2052" />subnet statements define the networks
that <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> serves. The identity of each network is
determined from the address and the address mask, both of which are
required by the subnet statement. <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> provides
configuration services only to clients that are attached to one of
these networks. There must be a subnet statement for every subnet to
which the server physically connects, even if some subnets do not
contain any clients. <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> requires the subnet
information to complete its startup.
</p>

<p>The options and parameters defined in a subnet statement apply only
to the subnet and its clients. The meanings of the sample options are
clear. They tell the clients what router and what broadcast address
to use. The <tt class="literal">range</tt> parameter is more interesting,
as it goes to the heart of one of DHCP's key features.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">range</tt><a name="INDEX-2053" /> <a name="INDEX-2054" />
parameter defines the scope of addresses that are available for
<a name="INDEX-2055" />
<a name="INDEX-2056" />dynamic address allocation. It
always occurs in association with a subnet statement, and the range
of addresses must fall within the address space of the subnet. The
scope of the <tt class="literal">range</tt> parameter is defined by the two
addresses it contains. The first address is the lowest address that
can be automatically assigned, and the second is the highest address
that can be assigned. The first <tt class="literal">range</tt> parameter in
the example identifies a contiguous group of addresses from
172.16.12.50 to 172.16.12.250 that are available for dynamic
assignment. Notice that the second subnet statement has two
<tt class="literal">range</tt> parameters. This creates two separate groups
of dynamic addresses. The reason for this might be that some
addresses were already manually assigned before the DHCP server was
installed. Regardless of the reason, the point is that we can define
a noncontiguous dynamic address space with multiple
<tt class="literal">range</tt> statements.
</p>

<p>If a <tt class="literal">range</tt> parameter is defined in a subnet
statement, any DHCP client on the subnet that requests an address is
granted one as long as addresses are available. If a
<tt class="literal">range</tt> parameter is not defined, dynamic addressing
is not enabled.
</p>

<p>To provide automatic address assignment for <a name="INDEX-2057" /><a name="INDEX-2058" />BOOTP clients, add the
<tt class="literal">dynamic-bootp</tt><a name="INDEX-2059" /> argument to
the <tt class="literal">range</tt> parameter. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> range dynamic-bootp 172.16.8.10 172.16.8.50;</pre></blockquote>

<p>By default, BOOTP clients are assigned permanent addresses. It is
possible to override this default behavior with either the
<tt class="literal">dynamic-bootp-lease-cutoff</tt><a name="INDEX-2060" /> or the
<tt class="literal">dynamic-bootp-lease-length</tt><a name="INDEX-2061" /> parameter. However, BOOTP clients do
not understand address leases and do not know that they should renew
an address. Therefore the
<tt class="literal">dynamic-bootp-lease-cutoff</tt> and the
<tt class="literal">dynamic-bootp-lease-length</tt> parameters are used
only in special circumstances. If you're interested in these
parameters, see <a href="appd_01.html">Appendix D, "A dhcpd Reference"</a>.
</p>

<p>Each BOOTP client should have an associated <a name="INDEX-2062" /><a name="INDEX-2063" />host statement that is used to assign
the client configuration parameters and options. It can be used to
manually assign the client a permanent, fixed address. The sample
configuration file ends with three host statements: one for
<em class="emphasis">24seven</em>, one for <em class="emphasis">rodent</em>,
and one for <em class="emphasis">ring</em>. Each host statement contains a
hardware parameter that defines the type of network hardware
(<tt class="literal">ethernet</tt>) and the physical network address (e.g.,
<tt class="literal">08:80:20:01:59:c3</tt>) used by the client. The
hardware parameter is required in host statements for BOOTP clients.
The Ethernet address is used by <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> to identify
the BOOTP client. DHCP clients can also have associated
<tt class="literal">host</tt> statements. For DHCP clients, the hardware
parameter is optional because a DHCP client can be identified by the
<tt class="literal">dhcp-client-identifier</tt> option. However, it is
simpler for a DHCP client connected via Ethernet to be identified by
its Ethernet address.
</p>

<p>A wide variety of parameters and options can be defined in the
<tt class="literal">host</tt> statement. For example, adding to each
<tt class="literal">host</tt> statement an option similar to the following
assigns each client a hostname:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">option host-name 24seven;</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is often easier, however, to define options and parameters at a
higher level. Global options apply to all systems. Subnet options
apply to every client on the subnet, but the options defined inside a
<tt class="literal">host</tt> statement apply to only a single host. The
<tt class="literal">host-name</tt> option shown above would need to be
repeated with a different hostname in every host statement. An easier
way to define a parameter or option for a group of hosts is to use a
<tt class="literal">group</tt> statement.
</p>

<p>A <tt class="literal">group</tt><a name="INDEX-2064" /> statement groups together
any other statements. The sole purpose of the
<tt class="literal">group</tt> statement is to apply parameters and options
to all <a name="INDEX-2065" />members of the group. That is
exactly what we do in the example. The <tt class="literal">group</tt>
statement groups all of the host statements together. The
<tt class="literal">use-host-decl-names</tt> parameter in the
<tt class="literal">group</tt> statement applies to every host in the
group. This particular parameter tells <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> to
assign each client the hostname that is declared on the host
statement associated with that client, which makes the
<tt class="literal">host-name</tt> option unnecessary for this
configuration.
</p>

<p>Given the sample <em class="emphasis">dhcpd.conf</em> file shown earlier,
when <tt class="literal">dhcpd</tt> receives a request packet from a client
with the Ethernet address 08:80:20:01:59:c3, it sends that client:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The address 172.16.12.2</p>
</li><li>
<p>The hostname <em class="emphasis">rodent</em></p>
</li><li>
<p>The default router address 172.16.12.1</p>
</li><li>
<p>The broadcast address 172.16.12.255</p>
</li><li>
<p>The subnet mask 255.255.255.0</p>
</li><li>
<p>The domain name <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em></p>
</li><li>
<p>The domain name server addresses 172.16.12.1 and 172.16.3.5</p>
</li><li>
<p>The print server address 172.16.12.1</p>
</li><li>
<p>The MTU for an Ethernet interface</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The client receives all global values, all subnet values, and all
host values that are appropriate. Clearly, DHCP can provide a
complete configuration.
</p>

<p>Your DHCP configuration, though larger in the number of systems
supported, probably is simpler than the example. Some commands appear
in the sample primarily for the purpose of illustration. The biggest
difference is that most sites do not serve more than one subnet with
a single configuration server. Servers are normally placed on each
subnet. This reduces the burden on the server, particularly the
burden that can be caused by a network-wide power outage. It
eliminates the need to move boot packets through routers. Also, the
fact that addresses are assigned at the subnet level makes placing
the assigning system at the subnet level as well somehow more
logical. DHCP servers are not the only servers that work best when
located close to the clients. In the next section we look at how to
keep distributed servers <a name="INDEX-2066" /> <a name="INDEX-2067" />updated.
