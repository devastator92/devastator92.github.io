<h2 class="sect1">9.3. Using Samba to Share Resources with Windows</h2>

<p>NFS and <tt class="literal">lpd</tt> are file and
<a name="INDEX-1952" />
<a name="INDEX-1953" />
<a name="INDEX-1954" />print sharing services for Unix
systems, and are both native TCP/IP applications. Microsoft Windows
printer and file sharing applications are based on NetBIOS (Network
Basic Input Output System). <em class="emphasis">Samba</em> bridges these
two worlds, providing file and print sharing for Unix and Windows
systems. Samba is the key to integrating Unix and Windows because it
allows a Unix system to be a file and print server for Windows
clients, or to be a client of a Windows server.
</p>

<p>The protocol used between
<a name="INDEX-1955" />NetBIOS clients and servers is Server
essage Block Protocol (SMB). Originally, NetBIOS was a monolithic
protocol that took data all the way from the application to the
physical network. Today, NetBIOS runs over TCP/IP, which allows
NetBIOS applications to run on Unix systems that use TCP/IP.
</p>

<p>Two things are needed to run NetBIOS on a TCP/IP network: a protocol
to carry NetBIOS data over TCP/IP and a technique to map NetBIOS
addresses to TCP/IP addresses. The protocol that transports NetBIOS
is <a name="INDEX-1956" /> <a name="INDEX-1957" /><em class="emphasis">NetBIOS over TCP/IP</em>
(NBT), which is defined by RFCs 1001 and 1002. Address mapping is
handled by a special NetBIOS name server. Samba provides both of
these services.
</p>

<p>Samba services are implemented as two daemons. The SMB daemon
(<tt class="literal">smbd</tt><a name="INDEX-1958" /><a name="INDEX-1959" />),
the heart of Samba, provides the file and printer sharing services.
The NetBIOS name server daemon (<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt>) provides
NetBIOS-to-IP-address name service. NBT requires some method for
mapping NetBIOS computer names, which are the addresses of a NetBIOS
network, to the IP addresses of a TCP/IP network.
</p>

<p>Samba is included in most Linux distributions and is installed during
the initial system installation. On a Red Hat system, the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/init.d/smb</em> script runs at boot time,
and starts both <tt class="literal">smbd</tt> and <tt class="literal">nmbd</tt>.
Samba is not included in Solaris 8, but the software is available for
download from the Internet. Go <a name="INDEX-1960" />to
<a href="http://www.samba.org/">http://www.samba.org</a> to select your nearest
download site.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.3.1. Configuring a Samba Server</h3>

<p>The Samba server <a name="INDEX-1961" /> <a name="INDEX-1962" /> <a name="INDEX-1963" />is configured by the
<em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em><a name="INDEX-1964" /><a name="INDEX-1965" /> file. Look in the startup
script to see where <tt class="literal">smbd</tt> expects to find the
configuration file. On a Red Hat system, it is
<em class="emphasis">/etc/samba/smb.conf</em>. On a Caldera system, it is
<em class="emphasis">/etc/samba.d/smb.conf</em>. The default used in most
Samba documentation is
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf</em>. Use
<tt class="literal">find</tt> or check the startup script so you know where
it is on your system.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em> file is divided into sections.
Except for the global section, which defines configuration parameters
for the entire server, the sections are named after
<em class="emphasis">shares</em>. A share is a resource offered by the
server to the clients. It can be either a filesystem or a shared
printer.
</p>

<p>The best way to learn about the <em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em> file is
to look at one. Minus the printers share, which is covered later, the
Red Hat <em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em> file contains these active
lines:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[global]
   workgroup = MYGROUP
   server string = Samba Server
   printcap name = /etc/printcap
   load printers = yes
   printing = lprng
   log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
   max log size = 0
   security = user
   encrypt passwords = yes
   smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
  dns proxy = no
[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no
   writable = yes
   valid users = %S
   create mode = 0664
   directory mode = 0775</pre></blockquote>

<p>Two sections of the Red Hat configuration file,
<em class="emphasis">global</em> and <em class="emphasis">homes</em>, are
listed above. The <a name="INDEX-1966" /> <a name="INDEX-1967" />global
section defines parameters that affect the entire server:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-1968" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">workgroup</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the hierarchical grouping of hosts, called a workgroup, of
which this server is a member. Replace the MYGROUP name in the
example with a meaningful workgroup name of 15 characters or less.
ake sure you use a meaningful name. Never use the name MYGROUP or
WORKGROUP.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1969" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">server string</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the descriptive comment for this server that is displayed by
the <tt class="literal">net</tt> <tt class="literal">view</tt> command on DOS
clients. Change the string in the example to something meaningful for
your system.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1970" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">printcap name</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the location of the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file. The
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file is used to identify the printers
that are available to share. The default path is
<em class="emphasis">/etc/printcap</em>.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1971" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">load printers</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether or not all the printers in the
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file are to be shared. The default is
<tt class="literal">yes</tt>, use all the printers defined in the
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file. <tt class="literal">no</tt> means
don't read the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file at all. If
<tt class="literal">no</tt> is specified, all shared printers must be
defined individually.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1972" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">printing</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Identifies the Unix printing system used by the server. In the
example, it is LPR Next Generation (<tt class="literal">lprng</tt>), which
is an implementation of the standard LPR/LPD system described earlier
in this chapter.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1973" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">log file</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the location of the log file. The example contains the
<tt class="literal">%m</tt> variable,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-104">[104]</a> which varies according to the client's NetBIOS
name. This creates a different log file for each client with a file
extension that is the client's NetBIOS name. If the NetBIOS
name of the client is <em class="emphasis">crab</em>, the log file is
named <em class="emphasis">/var/log/samba/log.crab</em>. If the
client's NetBIOS name is <em class="emphasis">rodent</em>, the log
file is <em class="emphasis">/var/log/samba/log.rodent</em>.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-104" /><p>[104]Samba has about 20
different variables. See the manpage for a full list.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1974" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">max log size</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the maximum size of a log file in kilobytes. The default is 5
B, or 5000 KB. (If the maximum size is exceeded,
<tt class="literal">smbd</tt> closes the log and renames it with the
extension <em class="emphasis">.old</em>.) In the sample configuration,
this is set to 0, which means that no maximum size is set for log
files.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1975" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">security</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the type of security used. There are four possible settings:</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-1976" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">share</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Requests share-level security. This is the lowest level of security.
The resource is shared with everyone. It is possible to associate a
password with a share, but the password is the same for everyone.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1977" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">user</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Requests user-level security. Every user is required to enter a
username and an associated password. By default, this is the username
and password defined in <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>. The default
values for passwords can be changed. See the discussion of passwords
later in this section.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1978" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">server</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines server-level security. This is similar to user-level
security, but an external server is used to authenticate the username
and password. The external server must be defined by the password
server option.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1979" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">domain</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines domain-level security. In this scheme, the Linux server joins
a Windows NT/2000 domain and uses the Windows NT/2000 domain
controller as the server that approves usernames and passwords. Use
the password server option to point to the Windows NT/2000 Primary
Domain Controller (PDC). Log into the PDC and create an account for
the Linux system. Finally, add these lines to the global section on
the Linux system:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">domain master = no
local master = no
preferred master = no
os level = 0</pre></blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1980" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">encrypt passwords</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Setting this option to <tt class="literal">yes</tt> causes Samba to encrypt
passwords before they are sent across the network. This makes the
server more compatible with Windows clients from Windows 98 on, which
default to encrypted passwords, and makes it harder for intruders to
sniff passwords from the network. By default, Samba uses clear-text
Unix passwords.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">smb passwd file</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option points to the location of the
<em class="emphasis">smbpasswd</em> file, where encrypted Samba passwords
are stored. When encrypted passwords are used, the Samba server must
maintain two password files: <em class="emphasis">passwd</em> and
<em class="emphasis">smbpasswd</em>. Use the
<em class="emphasis">mksmbpasswd</em>.<em class="emphasis">sh</em> script to
build the initial <em class="emphasis">smbpasswd</em> file from the
<em class="emphasis">passwd</em> file.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1981" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">socket options</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines performance tuning parameters. This option is not required,
although setting the send and receive buffers to 8 KB may slightly
increase performance. In the case of this sample Red Hat
configuration, the <tt class="literal">TCP_NODELAY</tt> setting, which
causes Samba to send multiple packets with each transfer, has no
effect because it is the default for versions of Samba 2.0.4 or
higher. See Appendix B of <em class="emphasis">Using Samba</em>, by Kelly,
Eckstein, and Collier-Brown (O'Reilly) for a good discussion of
Samba performance tuning.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1982" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">dns proxy</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether or not <tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> should forward
unresolved NBNS queries to DNS.
</p>
</dd>

<p>As the Red Hat sample configuration demonstrates, many servers come
preconfigured with reasonable global parameters to begin running a
simple server system. In addition to a preconfigured
<em class="emphasis">global</em> section, the Red Hat configuration comes
with a preconfigured <em class="emphasis">homes</em> section.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-3.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.3.1.1. The smb.conf homes section</h3>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">homes</em> <a name="INDEX-1989" /> <a name="INDEX-1990" />section
is a special share section. It tells <tt class="literal">smbd</tt> to
permit users to access their home directories through SMB. Unlike
other share sections, which we cover later, this section does not
tell <tt class="literal">smbd</tt> the specific path of the directory being
shared. Instead, <tt class="literal">smbd</tt> uses the home directory from
the <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> file based on the username of
the user requesting the share. The configuration parameters in the
Red Hat <em class="emphasis">homes</em> section are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-1991" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">comment</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides a description of the share that is displayed in the comment
field of the Network Neighborhood window when this share is viewed on
a Windows PC.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1992" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">browseable</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether or not all users may browse the contents of this
share. <tt class="literal">no</tt> means that only users with the correct
user ID are allowed to browse this share. <tt class="literal">yes</tt>
means all users, regardless of UID, can browse the share. This
parameter controls only browsing; actual access to the contents of
the share is controlled by standard Linux file permissions.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1993" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">writable</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies whether or not files can be written to this share. If
<tt class="literal">yes</tt>, the share can be written to. If
<tt class="literal">no</tt>, the share is read-only. This parameter defines
the actions permitted by Samba. Actual permission to write to the
directory defined by the share is still controlled by standard Linux
file <a name="INDEX-1994" />
<a name="INDEX-1995" />
<a name="INDEX-1996" />permissions. 
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">valid users</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option lists the users who are allowed to use this share. In
this example, <tt class="literal">%S</tt> contains the name of the user
allowed to access this share.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">create mode</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option defines the file permissions used when a client creates a
file within the <em class="emphasis">homes</em> share.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">directory mode</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option defines the permissions used when a client creates a
directory within the <em class="emphasis">homes</em> share.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-3.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.3.1.2. Sharing directories through Samba</h3>

<p>To share a directory <a name="INDEX-1997" />
<a name="INDEX-1998" />through Samba, create a share section
in <em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em><a name="INDEX-1999" />
that describes the directory and the conditions under which it will
be shared. To share a new directory named
<em class="emphasis">/usr/doc/pcdocs</em> and the
<em class="emphasis">/home/research</em> directory used in the NFS
examples, add the following two share sections to the sample
<em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[pcdocs]
     comment = PC Documentation
     path = /usr/doc/pcdocs
     browseable = yes
     writable = no
     public = yes

[research]
     comment = Research Deptment Shared Directory
     path = /home/research
     browseable = no
     writable = yes
     create mode = 0750
     hosts allow = horseshoe,jerboas,crab,rodent</pre></blockquote>

<p>Each share section is labeled with a meaningful name. This name is
displayed as a folder in the Network Neighborhood window on client
PCs. The example contains some commands we have already covered and a
few new commands. The first new command is <tt class="literal">path</tt>,
which defines the path of the directory being offered by this share.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">pcdocs</em> share also contains the command
<tt class="literal">public</tt>, which grants everyone access, even if they
don't have a valid username or password. These public users are
granted "guest account" access to the share. On a Linux
system, this means they run as user <em class="emphasis">nobody</em> and
group <em class="emphasis">nobody</em> and are limited to world
permissions.
</p>

<p>Files may be written to the research share. The
<tt class="literal">create</tt> <tt class="literal">mode</tt> command controls
the Unix permissions used when a client writes a file to the share.
In the example, the permission 0750 specifies that files will be
created as read/write/execute for the owner, read/execute for the
group, and no permissions for the world. A related command,
<tt class="literal">directory mode</tt>, defines the permission used when a
client creates a directory within a share. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">directory mode = 0744</pre></blockquote>

<p>This sets the permissions for new directories to read/write/execute
for the owner, read/execute for the group, and read/execute for the
world. This is a reasonable setting that allows <tt class="literal">cd</tt>
and <tt class="literal">ls</tt> to work as expected.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">research</em> share section also contains a
<tt class="literal">hosts</tt> <tt class="literal">allow</tt> command, which
defines the clients that are allowed to access this share. Even if a
user has the correct username and password, that user is allowed to
access this share only from the specified hosts. By default, all
hosts are granted access, and specific access is controlled by the
username and password.
</p>

<p>In addition to the <tt class="literal">hosts</tt> <tt class="literal">allow</tt>
command, there is a <tt class="literal">hosts</tt> <tt class="literal">deny</tt>
command that defines computers that are explicitly denied access to
the share. Its syntax is similar to that of the <tt class="literal">hosts
allow</tt> command.
</p>

<p>Combining these two new share sections with the section that came
with the Red Hat configuration creates a server that provides access
to user home directories, to public directories, and to private
directories limited to members of a group. This provides the same
services as NFS in a manner that is simpler for Microsoft Windows
clients to use. Samba can also be used to share printers with Windows
clients.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-3.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.3.1.3. Sharing printers through Samba</h3>

<p>Shared <a name="INDEX-2000" /> <a name="INDEX-2001" />printers are configured through the
<em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em><a name="INDEX-2002" />
file. The Red Hat system comes with a <em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em>
file that is preconfigured for sharing printers. The following lines
occur right after the <em class="emphasis">global</em> and
<em class="emphasis">homes</em> sections in the Red Hat
<em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   path = /var/spool/samba
   browseable = no
   guest ok = no
   writable = no
   printable = yes</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">printcap</tt> and <tt class="literal">load printers</tt>
lines in the global section prepare the server to share the printers
defined in the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file. This
<em class="emphasis">printers</em> section makes those printers available
to the clients in a manner similar to the way the
<em class="emphasis">homes</em> section makes every home directory
available to the appropriate user. The Red Hat
<em class="emphasis">printers</em> share section contains five parameters.
</p>

<p>Three of the parameters, <tt class="literal">comment</tt>,
<tt class="literal">browseable</tt>, and <tt class="literal">path</tt>, were
explained previously. Here, however, <tt class="literal">path</tt> does not
define the path of a shared file. Instead, it defines the path of the
spool directory for the SMB printers.
</p>

<p>We introduce two new parameters in this configuration, the first of
which is <tt class="literal">printable</tt>, which identifies this share as
a printer. The default for this option is <tt class="literal">no</tt>,
meaning that by default, shares are considered to be file shares
instead of printer shares. To create a printer share, set this option
to <tt class="literal">yes</tt>. Setting <tt class="literal">printable = yes</tt>
permits clients to write printer files to the spool directory defined
by the <tt class="literal">path</tt> option. Use a <tt class="literal">create
mode</tt> command to limit the permissions of the files created
by clients in the spool directory. For example, <tt class="literal">create mode
= 0700</tt>.
</p>

<p>The other new line, <tt class="literal">guest</tt> <tt class="literal">ok</tt>,
defines whether or not guest accounts are permitted access to the
resource. This is exactly the same as the <tt class="literal">public</tt>
option discussed earlier, so these two options are used
interchangeably. <tt class="literal">no</tt> means that the user
<em class="emphasis">nobody</em> cannot send a print job to the printer. A
user must have a valid user account to use the printer. This is
designed to prevent guest users from abusing the printer, but it is
also useful to have a valid username for sorting out print jobs if
you use banner pages and accounting on the server.
</p>

<p>Generally, a print server offers all of its printers to all of its
clients. However, individual share sections can be created for each
printer in the same way that they are created for file sharing. If
you don't want to share every printer, remove the printers
section, set the <tt class="literal">load printers</tt> option to
<tt class="literal">no</tt>, and add individual share sections for just
those printers that you want to share.
</p>

<p>An <em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em> file with a share section for a
specific printer might contain:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[global]

<p>This sample file has no printers section. Instead, a share section
named <em class="emphasis">hp5m</em> is added that shares a printer named
<em class="emphasis">lp</em>. The printer name must be found in the
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file for this to work. The
<tt class="literal">printcap</tt> option is allowed to default to
<em class="emphasis">/etc/printcap</em>.
</p>

<p><tt class="literal">smbd</tt> is the component of Samba that provides file
and printer sharing. The other component of Samba is <a name="INDEX-2003" /> <a name="INDEX-2004" /><tt class="literal">nmbd</tt>.

<h3 class="sect2">9.3.2. NetBIOS Name Service</h3>

<p>The NetBIOS name <a name="INDEX-2005" />
<a name="INDEX-2006" /> <a name="INDEX-2007" /> <a name="INDEX-2008" />
<a name="INDEX-2009" />server daemon (<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt>)
is the part of the basic Samba software distribution that turns a
Unix server into a NetBIOS name server (NBNS).
<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> can handle queries from LanManager clients,
and it can be configured to act as a Windows Internet Name Server
(WINS).
</p>

<p><tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> is configured in the global section of the
<em class="emphasis">smb.conf</em><a name="INDEX-2010" /> file. The options that relate
to running WINS are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2011" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">wins support</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set to <tt class="literal">yes</tt> or <tt class="literal">no</tt>. This option
determines whether or not <tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> runs as a WINS
server. <tt class="literal">no</tt> is the default, so by default,
<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> provides browsing controls but does not
provide WINS service.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2012" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">dns proxy</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set to <tt class="literal">yes</tt> or <tt class="literal">no</tt>. This option
tells <tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> to use DNS to resolve WINS queries that
it cannot resolve any other way. This is significant only if
<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> is running as a WINS server. The default is
<tt class="literal">yes</tt>. DNS can help with NetBIOS name resolution
only if NetBIOS names and DNS hostnames are the same.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2013" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">wins server</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set to the IP address of an external WINS server. This option is
useful only if you're not running a WINS server on your Linux
system. This option tells Samba the address of the external WINS
server to which it should send NetBIOS name queries.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2014" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">wins proxy</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set to <tt class="literal">yes</tt> or <tt class="literal">no</tt>. The default
is <tt class="literal">no</tt>. When set to <tt class="literal">yes</tt>,
<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> resolves broadcast NetBIOS name queries by
turning them into unicast queries and sending them directly to the
WINS server. If <tt class="literal">wins support = yes</tt> is set, these
queries are handled by <tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> itself. If instead
<tt class="literal">wins</tt> <tt class="literal">server</tt> is set, these
queries are sent to the external server. The <tt class="literal">wins
proxy</tt> option is needed only if clients don't know the
address of the server or don't understand the WINS protocol.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The NetBIOS name server is generally started at boot time with the
following command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">nmbd -D</pre></blockquote>

<p>When started with the -<tt class="literal">D</tt> option,
<tt class="literal">nmbd</tt> runs continuously as a daemon listening for
NetBIOS name service requests on port 137. The server answers
requests using registration data collected from its clients and the
NetBIOS name-to-address mappings it has learned from other servers.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">lmhosts</em> file is used to manually map
addresses when that is necessary. Most WINS servers do not need an
<em class="emphasis">lmhosts</em> file because the servers learn address
mappings dynamically from clients and other servers. NetBIOS names
are self-registered; clients register their NetBIOS names with the
server when they boot. The addresses and names are stored in the WINS
database, <em class="emphasis">wins.dat</em>. The
<em class="emphasis">lmhosts</em> file is only a small part of the total
database.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">lmhosts</em> file is similar to the
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em> file described in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Getting Started"</a>. Each entry begins with an IP address that is
followed by a hostname. However, this time, the hostname is the
NetBIOS name. Here is a sample <em class="emphasis">lmhosts</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">cat /etc/lmhosts</b>
172.16.12.3       horseshoe
172.16.12.1       crab
172.16.12.2       rodent
172.16.12.4       jerboas</pre></blockquote>

<p>Given this <em class="emphasis">lmhosts</em> file, the NetBIOS name
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em> maps to IP address 172.16.12.2. Notice
that these NetBIOS names are the same as the TCP/IP hostnames
assigned to these clients. Use the same hostnames for both NetBIOS
and TCP/IP. Doing otherwise limits configuration choices and creates
confusion.
