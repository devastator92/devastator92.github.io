<h2 class="sect1">1.2. A Data Communications Model</h2>

<p>To discuss computer <a name="INDEX-63" />networking, it <a name="INDEX-64" />is necessary to use terms that have
special meaning. Even other computer professionals may not be
familiar with all the terms in the networking alphabet soup. As is
always the case, English and computer-speak are not equivalent (or
even necessarily compatible) languages. Although descriptions and
examples should make the meaning of the networking jargon more
apparent, sometimes terms are ambiguous. A common frame of reference
is necessary for understanding data communications terminology.
</p>

<p>An architectural model developed by the International Standards
Organization (ISO) is frequently used to describe the structure and
function of data communications protocols. This architectural model,
which is called the <em class="emphasis">Open Systems Interconnect</em>
<a name="INDEX-65" />(OSI) <em class="emphasis">Reference
odel</em>, <a name="INDEX-66" />provides a common reference for
discussing communications. The terms defined by this model are well
understood and widely used in the data communications
community -- so widely used, in fact, that it is difficult to
discuss data communications without using OSI's terminology.
</p>

<p>The OSI Reference Model contains seven <em class="emphasis">layers</em>
<a name="INDEX-67" />that <a name="INDEX-68" />define the
functions of data communications protocols. Each layer of the OSI
model represents a function performed when data is transferred
between cooperating applications across an intervening network. <a href="ch01_02.html#tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-1">Figure 1-1</a> identifies each layer by name and provides a
short functional description for it. Looking at this figure, the
protocols are like a pile of building blocks stacked one upon
another. Because of this appearance, the structure is often called a
<em class="emphasis">stack</em>
<a name="INDEX-69" />
<a name="INDEX-70" />or
<em class="emphasis">protocol stack</em>.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="355" alt="Figure 1-1" src="figs/tcp3_0101.gif" width="200" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 1-1. The OSI Reference Model</h4>

<p>A layer does not define a single protocol -- it defines a data
communications function that may be performed by any number of
protocols. Therefore, each layer may contain multiple protocols, each
providing a service suitable to the function of that layer. For
example, a file transfer protocol and an electronic mail protocol
both provide user services, and both are part of the Application
Layer.
</p>

<p>Every protocol communicates with its peers. A
<em class="emphasis">peer</em><a name="INDEX-71" />
<a name="INDEX-72" />
is an implementation of the same protocol in the equivalent layer on
a remote system; i.e., the local file transfer protocol is the peer
of a remote file transfer protocol. Peer-level communications must be
standardized for successful communications to take place. In the
abstract, each protocol is concerned only with communicating to its
peers; it does not care about the layers above or below it.
</p>

<p>However, there must also be agreement on how to pass data between the
layers on a single computer, because every layer is involved in
sending data from a local application to an equivalent remote
application. The upper layers rely on the lower layers to transfer
the data over the underlying network. Data is passed down the stack
from one layer to the next until it is transmitted over the network
by the Physical Layer protocols. At the remote end, the data is
passed up the stack to the receiving application. The individual
layers do not need to know how the layers above and below them
function; they need to know only how to pass data to them. Isolating
network communications functions in different layers minimizes the
impact of technological change on the entire protocol suite. New
applications can be added without changing the physical network, and
new network hardware can be installed without rewriting the
application software.
</p>

<p>Although the OSI model is useful, the TCP/IP protocols don't
match its structure exactly. Therefore, in our discussions of TCP/IP,
we use the layers of the OSI model in the following way:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Application Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-73" />The
<a name="INDEX-74" />Application Layer is the level of the
protocol hierarchy where user-accessed network processes reside. In
this text, a TCP/IP application is any network process that occurs
above the Transport Layer. This includes all of the processes that
users directly interact with as well as other processes at this level
that users are not necessarily aware of.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Presentation Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-75" />For <a name="INDEX-76" />cooperating applications to exchange
data, they must agree about how data is represented. In OSI, the
Presentation Layer provides standard data presentation routines. This
function is frequently handled within the applications in TCP/IP,
though TCP/IP protocols such as <a name="INDEX-77" />XDR and MIME
<a name="INDEX-78" />also perform this function.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Session Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-79" />As
<a name="INDEX-80" />with
the Presentation Layer, the Session Layer is not identifiable as a
separate layer in the TCP/IP protocol hierarchy. The OSI Session
Layer manages the sessions (connections) between cooperating
applications. In TCP/IP, this function largely occurs in the
Transport Layer, and the term "session" is not used;
instead, the terms
<a name="INDEX-81" />"socket"
and "port"
<a name="INDEX-82" />are used to describe
the path over which cooperating applications communicate.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Transport Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-83" /><a name="INDEX-84" />Much <a name="INDEX-85" />of our discussion of TCP/IP is directed
to the protocols that occur in the Transport Layer. The Transport
Layer in the OSI reference model guarantees that the receiver gets
the data exactly as it was sent. In TCP/IP, this function is
performed by the <em class="emphasis">Transmission Control Protocol</em>
(TCP). However, TCP/IP offers a second Transport Layer service,
<em class="emphasis">User Datagram Protocol</em><a name="INDEX-86" /><a name="INDEX-87" /> (UDP), that does not
perform the end-to-end reliability checks.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Network Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-88" />The <a name="INDEX-89" />Network Layer manages connections across
the network and isolates the upper layer protocols from the details
of the underlying network. The Internet Protocol (IP), which isolates
the upper layers from the underlying network and handles the
addressing and delivery of data, is usually described as
TCP/IP's Network Layer.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Data Link Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-90" />The <a name="INDEX-91" />reliable delivery of data across the
underlying physical network is handled by the Data Link Layer. TCP/IP
rarely creates protocols in the Data Link Layer. Most RFCs that
relate to the Data Link Layer discuss how IP can make use of existing
data link protocols.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Physical Layer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-92" />The <a name="INDEX-93" />Physical Layer defines the
characteristics of the
<a name="INDEX-94" />hardware needed to carry the data
transmission signal. Features such as voltage levels and the number
and location of interface pins are defined in this layer. Examples of
standards at the Physical Layer are interface connectors
<a name="INDEX-95" />such as RS232C
<a name="INDEX-96" />and
V.35,<a name="INDEX-97" /> and
standards for local area network wiring such as IEEE 802.3. TCP/IP
does not define physical standards -- it makes use of existing
standards.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The terminology of the OSI reference model helps us describe TCP/IP,
but to fully understand it, we must use an architectural model that
more closely matches the structure of TCP/IP. The next section
introduces the protocol model <a name="INDEX-98" />we'll <a name="INDEX-99" />use to describe
TCP/IP.
