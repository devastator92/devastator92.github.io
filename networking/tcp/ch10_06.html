<h2 class="sect1">10.6. Rewriting the Mail Address </h2>

<p>Rewrite rules
<a name="INDEX-2220" /> <a name="INDEX-2221" />are the heart of the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file. Rulesets are groups of
individual rewrite rules used to parse email addresses from user mail
programs and rewrite them into the form required by the mail delivery
programs. Each rewrite rule is defined by an <tt class="literal">R</tt>
command. The syntax of the <tt class="literal">R</tt><a name="INDEX-2222" /> command is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> R<em class="replaceable">pattern transformation comment</em></pre></blockquote>

<p>The fields in an <tt class="literal">R</tt> command are separated by tab
characters. The comment field is ignored by the system, but good
comments are vital if you want to have any hope of understanding
what's going on. The pattern and transformation fields are the
heart of this command.

<h3 class="sect2">10.6.1. Pattern Matching </h3>

<p>Rewrite rules
<a name="INDEX-2223" />
<a name="INDEX-2224" /> <a name="INDEX-2225" />match the input
address against the pattern, and if a match is found, they rewrite
the address in a new format using the rules defined in the
transformation. A rewrite rule may process the same address several
times because, after being rewritten, the address is again compared
against the pattern. If it still matches, it is rewritten again. The
cycle of pattern matching and rewriting continues until the address
no longer matches the pattern.
</p>

<p>The pattern is defined using macros, classes, literals, and special
metasymbols. The macros, classes, and literals provide the values
against which the input is compared, and the metasymbols define the
rules used in matching the pattern. <a href="ch10_06.html#tcp3-CHP-10-TABLE-3">Table 10-3</a>

<a name="INDEX-2226" />matching.

<a name="Footnote-122">
[122] This symbol is specific to Sun operating systems.</p> </blockquote>

<p>All of the metasymbols request a match for some number of tokens. A
<em class="emphasis">token</em> is a string of characters in an email
address delimited by an operator. The operators are the characters
defined in the OperatorChars option. Operators are also counted as
tokens when an address is parsed. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> becky@rodent.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>This email address contains seven tokens: becky, @, rodent, .,
wrotethebook, ., and com. This address would match the pattern:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> $-@$+</pre></blockquote>

<p>The address matches the pattern because:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>It has exactly one token before the @ that matches the requirement of
the <tt class="literal">$-</tt><a name="INDEX-2227" /> symbol.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It has an @ that matches the pattern's literal @.</p>
</li><li>
<p>It has one or more tokens after the @ that match the requirement of
the <tt class="literal">$+</tt> symbol.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Many addresses, such as <em class="emphasis">hostmaster@apnic.net</em> and
<em class="emphasis">craigh@ora.com</em>, match this pattern, but other
addresses do not. For example,
<em class="emphasis">rebecca.hunt@wrotethebook.com</em> does not match
because it has three tokens: rebecca, ., and hunt, before the @.
Therefore, it fails to meet the requirement of exactly one token
specified by the <tt class="literal">$-</tt> symbol. Using the metasymbols,
macros, and literals, patterns can be constructed to match any type
of email address.
</p>

<p>When an address matches a pattern, the strings from the address that
match the metasymbols are assigned to <em class="emphasis">indefinite
tokens</em><a name="INDEX-2228" />. The matching strings are
called indefinite tokens because they may contain more than one token
value. The indefinite tokens are identified numerically according to
the relative position in the pattern of the metasymbol that the
string matched. In other words, the indefinite token produced by the
match of the first metasymbol is called $1; the match of the second
symbol is called $2; the third is $3; and so on. When the address
<em class="emphasis">becky@rodent.wrotethebook.com</em> matched the
pattern <tt class="literal">$-@$+</tt>, two indefinite tokens were created.
The first is identified as $1 and contains the single token, becky,
that matched the <tt class="literal">$-</tt> symbol. The second indefinite
token is $2 and contains the five tokens -- rodent, .,
wrotethebook, ., and com -- that matched the <tt class="literal">$+</tt>
symbol. The indefinite tokens created by the pattern matching can
then be referenced by name ($1, $2, etc.) when rewriting the address.
</p>

<p>A few of the symbols in <a href="ch10_06.html#tcp3-CHP-10-TABLE-3">Table 10-3</a> are used only in
special cases. The <a name="INDEX-2229" /><tt class="literal">$@</tt> symbol is
normally used by itself to test for an empty, or null, address. The
symbols that test against NIS maps can only be used on Sun systems
that run the sendmail program that Sun provides with the operating
system. We'll see in the next section that systems running
basic sendmail can use NIS maps, but only for
transformation -- not for pattern matching.

<p>The <tt class="literal">$</tt><a name="INDEX-2236" /><em class="replaceable">n</em>
symbol, where <em class="replaceable">n</em> is a number, is used for
the indefinite token substitution discussed above. The indefinite
token is expanded and written to the "new" address.
Indefinite token substitution is essential for flexible address
rewriting. Without it, values could not be easily moved from the
input address to the rewritten address. The following example
demonstrates this.
</p>

<p>Addresses are always processed by several rewrite rules. No one rule
tries to do everything. Assume the input address
<em class="emphasis">mccafferty@rodent</em> has been through some
preliminary processing and now is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">kathy.mccafferty&lt;@rodent&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Assume the current rewrite rule is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">R$+&lt;@$-&gt; $1&lt;@$2.$D&gt; user@host -&gt; user@host.domain</pre></blockquote>

<p>The address matches the pattern because it contains one or more
tokens before the literal <tt class="literal">&lt;@</tt>, exactly one token
after the <tt class="literal">&lt;@</tt>, and then the literal
<tt class="literal">&gt;</tt>. The pattern match produces two indefinite
tokens that are used in the transformation to rewrite the address.
</p>

<p>The transformation contains the indefinite token $1, a literal
<tt class="literal">&lt;@</tt>, indefinite token $2, a literal dot
(<tt class="literal">.</tt>), the macro D, and the literal
<tt class="literal">&gt;</tt>. After the pattern matching, $1 contains
<em class="emphasis">kathy.mccafferty</em> and $2 contains
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em>. Assume that the macro D was defined
elsewhere in the <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file as
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>. In this case the input address
is rewritten as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">kathy.mccafferty&lt;@rodent.wrotethebook.com&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p><a href="ch10_06.html#tcp3-CHP-10-FIG-3">Figure 10-3</a> illustrates this specific address
rewrite. It shows the tokens derived from the input address and how
those tokens are matched against the pattern. It also shows the
indefinite tokens produced by the pattern matching and how the
indefinite tokens and other values from the transformation are used
to produce the rewritten address. After rewriting, the address is
again compared to the pattern. This time it fails to match the
pattern because it no longer contains exactly one token between the
literal <tt class="literal">&lt;@</tt> and the literal
<tt class="literal">&gt;</tt>. So, no further processing is done by this rewrite
rule and the address is passed to the next rule in line. Rules in a
ruleset are processed sequentially, though a few metasymbols can be
used to modify this flow.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-10-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="199" alt="Figure 10-3" src="figs/tcp3_1003.gif" width="432" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-3. Rewriting an address</h4>

<p>The <tt class="literal">$&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-2237" /><em class="replaceable">n</em>
symbol calls ruleset <em class="replaceable">n</em> and passes the
address defined by the remainder of the transformation to ruleset
<em class="replaceable">n</em> for processing. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$&gt;9 $1 % $2</pre></blockquote>

<p>This transformation calls ruleset 9 (<tt class="literal">$&gt;9</tt>), and
passes the contents of $1, a literal %, and the contents of $2 to
ruleset 9 for processing. When ruleset 9 finishes processing, it
returns a rewritten address to the calling rule. The returned email
address is then compared again to the pattern in the calling rule. If
it still matches, ruleset 9 is called again.
</p>

<p>The recursion built into rewrite rules creates the possibility for
infinite loops. sendmail does its best to detect possible loops, but
you should take responsibility for writing rules that don't
loop. The <tt class="literal">$@</tt> and the <tt class="literal">$:</tt> symbols
are used to control processing and to prevent loops. If the
transformation begins with the <tt class="literal">$@</tt> symbol, the
entire ruleset is terminated and the remainder of the transformation
is the value returned by the ruleset. If the transformation begins
with the <tt class="literal">$:</tt> symbol, the individual rule is
executed only once. Use <tt class="literal">$:</tt> to prevent recursion
and to prevent loops when calling other rulesets. Use
<tt class="literal">$@</tt> to exit a ruleset at a specific rule.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">$[</tt><a name="INDEX-2238" /><em class="emphasis">name</em><tt class="literal">$]</tt>
symbol converts a host's nickname or its IP address to its
canonical name by passing the value <em class="emphasis">name</em> to the
name server for resolution. For example, using the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> name servers,
<tt class="literal">$[mouse$]</tt> returns
<em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em> and
<tt class="literal">$[[172.16.12.1]$]</tt> returns
<em class="emphasis">crab.wrotethebook.com</em>.
</p>

<p>In the same way that a hostname or address is used to look up a
canonical name in the name server database, the
<tt class="literal">$(</tt><em class="emphasis">map</em>
<em class="emphasis">key</em><tt class="literal">$)</tt> syntax uses the
<em class="emphasis">key</em> to retrieve information from the database
identified by <em class="emphasis">map</em>. This is a more generalized
database retrieval syntax than the one that returns canonical
hostnames, and it is more complex to use. Before we get into the
details of setting up and using databases from within sendmail,
let's finish describing the rest of the syntax of rewrite
rules.
</p>

<p>There is a special rewrite rule syntax that is used in ruleset 0.
Ruleset 0 defines the triple (<em class="emphasis">mailer, host,
user</em>) that specifies the mail delivery program, the
recipient host, and the recipient user.
</p>

<p>The special transformation syntax used to do this is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> $#<em class="replaceable">mailer</em>$@<em class="replaceable">host</em>$:<em class="replaceable">user</em></pre></blockquote>

<p>An example of this syntax taken from the
<em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> sample file is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> R$*&lt;@$*&gt;$*   $#esmtp $@ $2 $: $1 &lt; @ $2 &gt; $3 user@host.domain</pre></blockquote>

<p>Assume the email address
<em class="emphasis">david&lt;@ora.wrotethebook.com&gt;</em> is processed
by this rule. The address matches the pattern
<tt class="literal">$*&lt;@$+&gt;$*</tt> because:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The address has zero or more tokens (david) that match the first
<tt class="literal">$*</tt> symbol.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The address has a literal &lt;@.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The address has zero or more tokens (the five tokens in
ora.wrotethebook.com) that match the requirement of the second
<tt class="literal">$*</tt> symbol.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The address has a literal &gt;.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The address has zero or more (in this case, zero) tokens that match
the requirement of the last <tt class="literal">$*</tt> symbol.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>This pattern match produces two indefinite tokens. Indefinite token
$1 contains <em class="emphasis">david</em> and $2 contains
<em class="emphasis">ora.wrotethebook.com</em>. No other matches occurred,
so $3 is null. These indefinite tokens are used to rewrite the
address into the following triple:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> $#smtp$@ora.wrotethebook.com$:david&lt;@ora.wrotethebook.com&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The components of this triple are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">$#smtp</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><tt class="literal">smtp</tt> is the internal name of the mailer that
delivers the message.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">$@ora.wrotethebook.com</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><tt class="literal">ora.wrotethebook.com</tt> is the recipient host.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">$:david&lt;@ora.wrotethebook.com&gt;</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><tt class="literal">david&lt;@ora.wrotethebook.com&gt;</tt> is the
recipient user.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>There are a few variations on the mailer triple syntax that are also
used in the templates of some rules. Two of these variations use only
the "mailer" component.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">$#OK</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates that the input address passed a security test. For example,
the address is permitted to relay mail.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">$#discard</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates that the input address failed some security test and that
the email message should be discarded.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>


<a name="ch10-4-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> Neither <tt class="literal">OK</tt>, <tt class="literal">discard</tt>, nor
<tt class="literal">error</tt> (which is discussed in a second) is declared
in <tt class="literal">M</tt> commands like real mailers. But the sendmail
documentation refers to them as "mailers" and so do we.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">$#OK</tt> and <tt class="literal">$#discard</tt> mailers
are used in relay control and security. The
<tt class="literal">$#discard</tt> mailer silently discards the mail and
does not return an error message to the sender. The
<tt class="literal">$#error</tt> mailer also handles undeliverable mail,
but unlike <tt class="literal">$#discard</tt>, it returns an error message
to the sender. The template syntax used with the
<tt class="literal">$#error</tt> mailer is more complex than the syntax of
either <tt class="literal">$#OK</tt> or <tt class="literal">$#discard</tt>. That
syntax is shown here:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$#error $@<em class="emphasis">dsn-code</em> $:<em class="emphasis">message</em></pre></blockquote>

<p>The mailer value must be <tt class="literal">$#error</tt>. The
<tt class="literal">$:</tt><em class="replaceable">message</em> field
contains the text of the error message that you wish to send. The
<tt class="literal">$@</tt><em class="replaceable">dsn-code</em> field is
optional. If it is provided, it appears before the
<em class="replaceable">message</em> and must contain a valid
<a name="INDEX-2239" /><a name="INDEX-2240" />
<a name="INDEX-2241" />Delivery
Status Notification (DSN) error code as defined by RFC 1893,
<em class="emphasis">Mail System Status Codes</em>.
</p>

<p>DSN codes are composed of three dot-separated components:</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2242" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">class</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides a broad classification of the status. Three values are
defined for class in the
RFC: <tt class="literal">2</tt> means success, <tt class="literal">4</tt> means
temporary failure, and <tt class="literal">5</tt> means permanent failure.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2243" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">subject</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Classifies the error messages as relating to one of eight categories:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">0</tt> (Undefined)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The specific category cannot be determined.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">1</tt> (Addressing)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A problem was encountered with the address.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">2</tt> (Mailbox)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A problem was encountered with the delivery mailbox.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">3</tt> (Mail system)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The destination mail delivery system is having a problem.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">4</tt> (Network)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The network infrastructure is having a problem.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">5</tt> (Protocol)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A protocol problem was encountered.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">6</tt> (Content)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The message content caused a translation error.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">7</tt> (Security)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A security problem was reported.</p>
</dd>

</dl>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2244" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">detail</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides the details of the specific error. The detail value is meaningful only in
context of the subject code. For example, x<tt class="literal">.1.1</tt> means a bad
destination user address and x<tt class="literal">.1.2</tt> means a bad destination host
address, while x<tt class="literal">.2.1</tt> means the mailbox is disabled and x<tt class="literal">.2.2</tt> means the
mailbox is full. There are far too many detail codes to list here.
See RFC 1893 for a full list.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>An error message written to use the DSN format might be:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">R&lt;@$+&gt; $#error$@5.1.1$:"user address required"</pre></blockquote>

<p>This rule returns the DSN code <tt class="literal">5.1.1</tt> and the
message <tt class="literal">"user address required"</tt> when the address
matches the pattern. The DSN code has a <tt class="literal">5</tt> in the class field, meaning it is
a permanent failure; a <tt class="literal">1</tt> in the subject field, meaning it is an
addressing failure; and a <tt class="literal">1</tt> in the detail field, meaning that, given the
subject value of 1, it is a bad user address.
</p>

<p>Error codes and the error syntax are part of the advanced
configuration options used for relay control and security. These
values are generated by the <tt class="literal">m4</tt> macro used to
select these advanced features. These values are very rarely placed
in the <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file by a system
administrator <a name="INDEX-2245" /> <a name="INDEX-2246" /> <a name="INDEX-2247" /> <a name="INDEX-2248" /> <a name="INDEX-2249" />directly.

</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> $(<em class="replaceable">map key</em> [$@<em class="replaceable">argument</em>...] [$:<em class="replaceable">default</em>] $)</pre></blockquote>

<p><em class="replaceable">map</em> is the name assigned to the database

to <em class="replaceable">map</em> is not limited by the rules that
govern macro names. Like mailer names, map names are used only inside
of the <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file and can be any name you
choose. Select a simple descriptive name, such as "users"

<tt class="literal">K</tt> command. (More on the <tt class="literal">K</tt>

</p>

<p><em class="replaceable">key</em> is the value used to index into the

address is not changed unless a <em class="replaceable">default</em>
value is provided.
</p>

<p>An <em class="replaceable">argument</em> is an additional value passed
to the database procedure along with the key. Multiple arguments can
be used, but each argument must start with <tt class="literal">$@</tt>. The
argument can be used by the database procedure to modify the value it
returns to sendmail. It is referenced inside the database as
<tt class="literal">%</tt><em class="emphasis">n</em>, where
<em class="replaceable">n</em> is a digit that indicates the order in
which the argument appears in the rewrite rule -- %1, %2, and so
on -- when multiple arguments are used. (Argument %0 is the
<em class="replaceable">key</em>.)
</p>

<p>An example will make the use of arguments clear. Assume the following
input address:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> tom.martin&lt;@sugar&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Further, assume the following database with the internal sendmail
name of "relays":
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">oil     %1&lt;@relay.fats.com&gt; 
sugar   %1&lt;@relay.calories.com&gt;
salt    %1&lt;@server.sodium.org&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Finally, assume the following rewrite rule:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> R$+&lt;@$-&gt; $(relays $2 $@ $1 $:$1&lt;@$2&gt; $)</pre></blockquote>

<p>The input address <em class="emphasis">tom.martin&lt;@sugar&gt;</em>
matches the pattern because it has one or more tokens (tom.martin)
before the literal &lt;@ and exactly one token (sugar) after it. The
pattern matching creates two indefinite tokens and passes them to the
transformation. The transformation calls the database (relays) and
passes it token $2 (sugar) as the key and token $1 (tom.martin) as
the argument. If the key is not found in the database, the default
($1&lt;@$2&gt;) is used. In this case, the key is found in the
database. The database program uses the key to retrieve
"%1@relay.calories.com", expands the %1 argument, and
returns "tom.martin@relay.calories.com" to sendmail,
which uses the returned value to replace the input address.
</p>

<p>Before a database can be used within sendmail, it must be defined.
This is done with the <tt class="literal">K</tt><a name="INDEX-2255" /> command. The syntax of the
<tt class="literal">K</tt> command is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> K<em class="replaceable">name type</em> [<em class="replaceable">arguments</em>]</pre></blockquote>

<p><em class="replaceable">name</em> is the name used to reference this
database within sendmail. In the example above, the
<em class="replaceable">name</em> is "relays".
</p>

<p><em class="replaceable">type</em> is the class of database. The
<em class="replaceable">type</em> specified in the <tt class="literal">K</tt>
command must match the database support compiled into your sendmail.
ost sendmail programs do not support all database types, but a few
basic types are widely supported. Common types are hash, btree, and
nis. There are many more, all of which are described in <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a>.
</p>

<p><em class="replaceable">arguments</em> are optional. Generally, the
only argument is the path of the database file. Occasionally the
arguments include flags that are interpreted by the database program.
The full list of <tt class="literal">K</tt> command flags that can be
passed in the argument field is found in <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a>.
</p>

<p>To define the "relays" database file used in the example
above, we might enter the following command in the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> Krelays hash /etc/mail/relays</pre></blockquote>

<p>The name <em class="emphasis">relays</em> is simply a name you chose
because it is descriptive. The database type
<em class="emphasis">hash</em> is a type supported by your version of
sendmail and was used by you when you built the database file.
Finally, the argument <em class="emphasis">/etc/mail/relays</em> is the
location of the database file you created.
</p>

<p>Don't worry if you're confused about how to build and use
database files within sendmail. We will revisit this topic later in
the chapter and the examples will make the practical use of database
files clear.

<h3 class="sect2">10.6.3. The Set Ruleset Command </h3>

<p>Rulesets are groups
<a name="INDEX-2256" />
<a name="INDEX-2257" /> <a name="INDEX-2258" /> <a name="INDEX-2259" />of associated rewrite rules that can
be referenced by a name or a number. The <tt class="literal">S</tt> command
marks the beginning of a ruleset and names it. In the
<tt class="literal">S</tt><em class="replaceable">name</em> command syntax,
<em class="replaceable">name</em> identifies the ruleset. Optionally a number
can also be assigned to the ruleset using the full
<tt class="literal">S</tt><em class="replaceable">name=number</em> syntax. In that
case, the ruleset can be referenced either by its name or its number.
It is even possible to identify a ruleset with a number instead of a
name by using the old <tt class="literal">S</tt><em class="replaceable">number</em>
syntax. This form of the syntax is primarily found in old
configurations because old versions of sendmail used numbers to
identify rulesets.
</p>

<p>Rulesets can be thought of as subroutines, or functions, designed to
process email addresses. They are called from mailer definitions,
from individual rewrite rules, or directly by sendmail. Six rulesets
have special functions and are called directly by sendmail. These
are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Ruleset canonify (3) is the first ruleset applied to addresses. It
converts an address to the canonical form:
<em class="emphasis">local-part</em>@<em class="emphasis">host.domain</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ruleset parse (0) is applied to the addresses used to deliver the
mail. Ruleset parse is applied after ruleset canonify, and only to
the recipient addresses actually used for mail delivery. It resolves
the address to the triple (<em class="replaceable">mailer,</em>
<em class="replaceable">host, user</em>) composed of the name of the
mailer that will deliver the mail, the recipient hostname, and the
recipient username.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ruleset sender (1) is applied to all sender addresses in the message.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ruleset recipient (2) is applied to all recipient addresses in the
message.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ruleset final (4) is applied to all addresses in the message and is
used to translate internal address formats into external address
formats.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ruleset localaddr (5) is applied to local addresses after sendmail
processes the address against the aliases file. Ruleset 5 is applied
only to local addresses that do not have an alias.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><a href="ch10_06.html#tcp3-CHP-10-FIG-4">Figure 10-4</a> shows the flow of the message and
addresses through these rulesets. The S and R symbols stand for
additional rulesets. They have names just like all normal rulesets,
but the names are not fixed as is the case with the rulesets
described above. The S and R ruleset names are identified in the S
and R fields of the mailer definition. Each mailer may specify its
own S and R rulesets for mailer-specific cleanup of the sender and
recipient addresses just before the message is delivered.
</p>

<p>There are, of course, many more rulesets in most
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> files. The other rulesets provide
additional address processing, and are called by existing rulesets
using the <tt class="literal">$&gt;</tt><em class="emphasis">n</em> construct.
(See <a href="ch10_08.html#tcp3-CHP-10-TABLE-5">Table 10-5</a> later in this chapter.) The
rulesets provided in any vendor's
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file will be adequate for delivering
SMTP mail. It's unlikely you'll have to add to these
rulesets, unless you want to add new features to your mailer.
