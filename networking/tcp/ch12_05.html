<h2 class="sect1">12.5. Access Control </h2>

<p><em class="emphasis">Access control</em> is a <a name="INDEX-2746" />
<a name="INDEX-2747" />technique
for limiting access. Routers and hosts that use access control check
the address of a host requesting a service against an
<em class="emphasis">access control list</em>. If the list says that the
remote host is permitted to use the requested service, the access is
granted. If the list says that the remote host is not permitted to
access the service, access is denied. Access control does not bypass
any normal security checks. It adds a check to validate the source of
a service request and retains all of the normal checks to validate
the user.
</p>

<p>Access control systems are common in terminal servers and routers.
For example, Cisco routers have an access control facility. Access
control software is also available for Unix hosts. Two such packages
are <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> and the TCP wrapper program. First we
examine TCP wrapper (<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>), which gets its name
from the fact that you wrap it around a network service so that the
service can be reached only by going through the wrapper.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.5.1. wrapper </h3>

<p>The wrapper package performs <a name="INDEX-2748" />
<a name="INDEX-2749" />
<a name="INDEX-2750" />two basic functions: it logs requests
for Internet services, and provides an access control mechanism for
Unix systems. Logging requests for specific network services is a
useful monitoring function, especially if you are looking for
possible intruders. If this were all it did, wrapper would be a
useful package. But the real power of wrapper is its ability to
control access to network services.
</p>

<p>The wrapper software is included with many versions of Linux and
Unix. The wrapper <tt class="literal">tar</tt> file containing the C source
code and Makefile necessary to build the wrapper daemon <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>
is also available from several sites on the Internet.
</p>

<p>If your Unix system does not include wrapper, download the source,
make <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>, and then install it in the same
directory as the other network daemons. Edit
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> and replace the path to each
network service daemon that you wish to place under access control
with the path to <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>. The only field in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> entry affected by
<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> is the sixth field, which contains the path
to the network daemon.
</p>

<p>For example, the entry for the <tt class="literal">finger</tt> daemon in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> on our Solaris 8 system is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">finger  stream  tcp6  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/in.fingerd  in.fingerd</pre></blockquote>

<p>The value in the sixth field is
<em class="emphasis">/usr/sbin/in.fingerd</em>. To monitor access to the
<tt class="literal">finger</tt> daemon, replace this value with
<em class="emphasis">/usr/sbin/tcpd</em>, as in the following entry:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">finger   stream  tcp6  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd   in.fingerd</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now when <tt class="literal">inetd</tt> receives a request for
<tt class="literal">fingerd</tt>, it starts <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>
instead. <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> then logs the
<tt class="literal">fingerd</tt> request, checks the access control
information, and, if permitted, starts the real
<tt class="literal">finger</tt> daemon to handle the request. In this way,
<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> acts as a gatekeeper for other functions.
</p>

<p>Make a similar change for every service you want to place under
access control. Good candidates for access control are
<tt class="literal">ftpd</tt>, <tt class="literal">tftpd</tt>,
<tt class="literal">telnetd</tt>, and <tt class="literal">fingerd</tt>.
Obviously, <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> cannot directly control access for
daemons that are not started by <tt class="literal">inetd</tt>, such as
<tt class="literal">sendmail</tt> and NFS. However, other tools, such as
<tt class="literal">portmapper</tt>, use the <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>
configuration files to enforce their own access controls. Thus the
wrapper configuration can have a positive impact on the security of
daemons that are not started by <tt class="literal">inetd</tt>.
</p>

<p>Using the wrapper on most Linux systems is even easier. There is no
need to download and install the <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> software. It
comes as an integral part of the Linux release. You don't even
have to edit the <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> file because
the sixth field of the entries in that file already points to the
<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> program, as shown below:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">finger   stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd   in.fingerd -w</pre></blockquote>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-5.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.5.1.1. tcpd access control files </h3>

<p>The information <a name="INDEX-2751" />
<a name="INDEX-2752" /> <a name="INDEX-2753" />
<a name="INDEX-2754" /> <a name="INDEX-2755" /><tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> uses to
control access is in two files,
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.allow</em><a name="INDEX-2756" /> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.deny</em><a name="INDEX-2757" />. Each file's function is
obvious from its name. <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> contains the
list of hosts that are allowed to access the network's
services, and <em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> contains the list of
hosts that are denied access. If the files are not found,
<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> permits every host to have access and simply
logs the access request. Therefore, if you only want to monitor
access, don't create these two files.
</p>

<p>If the files are found, <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> checks the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file first, followed by the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file. It stops as soon as it finds a
match for the host and the service in question. Therefore, access
granted by <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> cannot be overridden by
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em>.
</p>

<p>The format of entries in both files is the same:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="replaceable">service-list</em> : <em class="replaceable">host-list</em> [: <em class="replaceable">shell-command</em>]</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">service-list</em> is a list of network services,
separated by commas. These are the services to which access is being
granted (<em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em>) or denied
(<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em>). Each service is identified by the
process name used in the seventh field of the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> entry. This is simply the name
that immediately follows the path to <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> in
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em>. (See <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Basic Configuration "</a>
for a description of the arguments field in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> entry.)
</p>

<p>Again, let's use <tt class="literal">finger</tt> as an example. We
changed its <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> entry to read:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> finger   stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/etc/tcpd   in.fingerd</pre></blockquote>

<p>Given this entry, we would use <tt class="literal">in.fingerd</tt> as the
service name in a <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> or
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">host-list</em> is a comma-separated list of
hostnames, domain names, Internet addresses, or network numbers. The
systems listed in the host-list are granted access
(<em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em>) or denied access
(<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em>) to the services specified in the
service-list. A hostname or an Internet address matches an individual
host. For example, <em class="emphasis">rodent</em> is a hostname and
172.16.12.2 is an Internet address. Both match a particular host. A
domain name matches every host within that domain; e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">.wrotethebook.com</em> matches
<em class="emphasis">crab.wrotethebook.com</em>,
<em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em>,
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe.wrotethebook.com</em>, and any other hosts
in the domain. When specified in a <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> access
control list, domain names always start with a dot (.). A network
number matches every IP address within that network's address
space. For example, 172.16. matches 172.16.12.1, 172.16.12.2,
172.16.5.1, and any other address that begins with 172.16. Network
addresses in a <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> access control list always end
with a dot (.).
</p>

<p>A completed <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> entry that grants FTP
and Telnet access to all hosts in the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> domain is shown below:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ftpd,telnetd : .wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>Two special keywords can be used in <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em>
and <em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> entries. The keyword
<a name="INDEX-2758" />ALL
can be used in the service-list to match all network services, and in
the host-list to match all hostnames and addresses. The second
keyword, <a name="INDEX-2759" />LOCAL, can be used only in the
host-list. It matches all local hostnames. <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>
considers a hostname "local" if it contains no embedded
dots. Therefore, the hostname <em class="emphasis">rodent</em> would match
on LOCAL, but the hostname
<em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em> would not match. The
following entry affects all services and all local hosts:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : LOCAL</pre></blockquote>

<p>A more complete example of how <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> is used will
help you understand these entries. First, assume that you wish to
allow every host in your local domain
(<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>) to have access to all
services on your system, but you want to deny access to every service
to all other hosts. Make an entry in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.allow</em> to permit access to everything
by everyone in the local domain:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : LOCAL, .wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>The keyword ALL in the services-list indicates that this rule applies
to all network services. The colon (:) separates the services-list
from the host-list. The keyword LOCAL indicates that all local
hostnames without a domain extension are acceptable, and the
<em class="emphasis">.wrotethebook.com</em> string indicates that all
hostnames that have the <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> domain
name extensions are also acceptable.
</p>

<p>After granting access to just those systems you want to service,
explicitly deny access to all other systems using the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file. To prevent access by everyone
else, make this entry in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.deny</em>
file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : ALL</pre></blockquote>

<p>Every system that does not match the entry in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.allow</em> is passed on to
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.deny</em>. Here the entry denies everyone
access, regardless of what service they are asking for. Remember,
even with ALL in the services-list field, only services started by
<tt class="literal">inetd</tt>, and only those services whose entries in
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> have been edited to invoke
<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt>, are affected. This does not automatically
provide security for any other service.
</p>

<p>The syntax of a standard wrapper access control file can be a little
more complicated than the examples above. A
<em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file might contain:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">imapd, ipopd3 : 172.16.12.
ALL EXCEPT imapd, ipopd3 : ALL</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first entry says that every host whose IP address begins with
172.16.12 is granted access to the IMAP and POP services. The second
line says that all services except IMAP and POP are granted to all
hosts. These entries would limit mailbox service to a single subnet
while providing all other services to anyone who requested them. The
<a name="INDEX-2760" />EXCEPT keyword is used to except
items from an all-encompassing service list. It can also be used in
the host-list of an access rule. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL: .wrotethebook.com EXCEPT public.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>If this appeared in a <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file it would
permit every system in the <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>
domain to have access to all services except for the host
<em class="emphasis">public.wrotethebook.com</em>. The assumption is that
<em class="emphasis">public.wrotethebook.com</em> is untrusted for some
reason -- perhaps users outside of the domain are allowed to log
into <em class="emphasis">public</em>.
</p>

<p>The final syntax variation uses the at-sign (<tt class="literal">@</tt>) to
narrow the definition of services or hosts. Here are two examples:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">in.telnetd@172.16.12.2 : 172.16.12.0/255.255.255.0
in.rshd : KNOWN@robin.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>When the <tt class="literal">@</tt> appears in the services side of a rule
it indicates that the server has more than one IP address and that
the rule being defined applies only to one of those addresses.
Examples of systems with more than one address are multi-homed hosts
and routers. If your server is also the router that connects your
local network to outside networks, you may want to provide services
on the interface connected to the local network but not on the
interface connected to the outside world. The <tt class="literal">@</tt>
syntax lets you do that. If the first line in this example appeared
in a <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file, it would permit access to
the Telnet daemon through the network interface that has the address
172.16.12.2 by any client with an address that begins with 172.16.12.
</p>

<p>The purpose of the <tt class="literal">@</tt> when it appears in the
host-list of a rule is completely different. In the host-list, the
<tt class="literal">@</tt> indicates that a username is required from the
client as part of the access control test. This means that the client
must run an <tt class="literal">identd</tt> daemon. The host-list can test
for a specific username, but it is more common to use one of three
possible keywords:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2761" /><dt><i>KNOWN</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The result of the test is KNOWN when the remote system returns a
username in response to the query.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2762" /><dt><i>UNKNOWN</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The result of the test is UNKNOWN when the remote host does not run
<tt class="literal">identd</tt> and thus fails to respond to the query.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>ALL</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This setting requires the remote host to return a username. It is
equivalent to using KNOWN but is less commonly used.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The final field that can be used in these entries is the optional
shell-command field. When a match occurs for an entry that has an
optional shell command, <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> logs the access,
grants or denies access to the service, and then passes the shell
<a name="INDEX-2763" />command
<a name="INDEX-2764" />to the shell for <a name="INDEX-2765" /> <a name="INDEX-2766" /> <a name="INDEX-2767" /> <a name="INDEX-2768" /> <a name="INDEX-2769" />execution.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-5.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.5.1.2. Defining an optional shell command</h3>

<p>The shell <a name="INDEX-2770" />
<a name="INDEX-2771" />
<a name="INDEX-2772" />command
allows you to define additional processing that is triggered by a
match in the access control list. In all practical examples this
feature is used in the <em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file to gather
more information about the intruder or to provide immediate
notification to the system administrator about a potential security
attack. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : ALL : (safe_finger -l @%h | /usr/sbin/mail -s %d - %h root) &amp;</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example from a <em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file, all
systems that are not explicitly granted access in the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file are denied access to all
services. After logging the attempted access and blocking it,
<tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> sends the <tt class="literal">safe_finger</tt>
command to the shell for execution. All versions of
<tt class="literal">finger</tt>, including <tt class="literal">safe_finger</tt>,
query the remote host to find out who is logged into that host. This
information is useful when tracking down an attacker. The result of
the <tt class="literal">safe_finger</tt> command is mailed to the root
account. The ampersand (<tt class="literal">&amp;</tt>) at the end of the
line causes the shell commands to run in the background. This is
important. Without it, <tt class="literal">tcpd</tt> would sit and wait for
these programs to complete before returning to its own work.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">safe_finger</tt> program is provided with wrapper.
It is specially modified to be less vulnerable to attack than the
standard <tt class="literal">finger</tt> program.
</p>

<p>There are some variables, such as <tt class="literal">%h</tt> and
<tt class="literal">%d</tt>, used in the example above. These variables
allow you to take values for the incoming connection and to use them
in the shell process. <a href="ch12_05.html#tcp3-CHP-12-TABLE-1">Table 12-1</a> lists the
variables you can use.

<p><a href="ch12_05.html#tcp3-CHP-12-TABLE-1">Table 12-1</a> shows that <tt class="literal">%h</tt> is the

<em class="emphasis">foo.bar.org</em>. The command passed to the shell
would be:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">safe_finger -l @foo.bar.org | 
   /usr/sbin/mail -s in.rshd-foo.bar.org root</pre></blockquote>

<p>The standard wrapper access control syntax is a complete
configuration language that should cover any reasonable need. Despite
this, there is also an extended version of the wrapper access control
language.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-5.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.5.1.3. Optional access control language extensions</h3>

<p>If wrapper <a name="INDEX-2773" />
<a name="INDEX-2774" />is compiled with PROCESS_OPTIONS
enabled in the Makefile, the syntax of the wrapper access control
language is changed and extended. With PROCESS_OPTIONS enabled, the
command syntax is not limited to three fields. The new syntax is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="emphasis">service-list</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">:</b> <em class="emphasis">host-list</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">:</b> <em class="emphasis">option</em> <b class="emphasis-bold">:</b> <em class="emphasis">option</em> ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <em class="replaceable">service-list</em> and the
<em class="replaceable">host-list</em> are defined in exactly the same
way they were in the original wrapper syntax. The options are new,
and so is the fact that multiple options are allowed for each rule.
There are several possible options:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">allow</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Grants the requested service and must appear at the end of a rule.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">deny</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Denies the requested service and must appear at the end of a rule. </p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">spawn</tt> <em class="replaceable">shell-command</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Executes the specified shell command as a child process.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">twist</tt> <em class="replaceable">shell-command</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Executes the shell command instead of the requested service. </p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">keepalive</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sends keepalive messages to the remote host. If the host does not
respond, the connection is closed.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">linger</tt> <em class="replaceable">seconds</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how long to try to deliver data after the server closes the
connection.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">rfc931 [</tt> <em class="replaceable">timeout</em> <tt class="literal">]</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Uses the IDENT protocol to look up the user's name on the
remote host. <em class="replaceable">timeout</em> defines how many
seconds the server should wait for the remote host to respond.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">banners</tt> <em class="replaceable">path</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sends the contents of a message file to the remote system.
<em class="replaceable">path</em> is the name of a directory that
contains the banner files. The file displayed is the file that has
the same name as the network daemon process.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">nice [</tt> <em class="replaceable">number</em> <tt class="literal">]</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the <tt class="literal">nice</tt> value for the network service

</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">umask</tt> <em class="replaceable">mask</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets a <tt class="literal">umask</tt> value for files used by the network
service process.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">user</tt> <em class="replaceable">user</em><tt class="literal">[.</tt><em class="replaceable">group</em><tt class="literal">]</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the user ID and group ID under which the network service

</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">setenv</tt> <em class="replaceable">variable</em> <em class="replaceable">value</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets an environment variable for the process runtime environment.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>A few examples based on the samples shown earlier will illustrate the
differences in the new syntax. Using the new syntax, a
<em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file might contain:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL : LOCAL, .wrotethebook.com : ALLOW
in.ftpd,in.telnetd : eds.oreilly.com : ALLOW
ALL : ALL : DENY</pre></blockquote>

<p>With the new syntax there is no need to have two files. The options
ALLOW and DENY permit everything to be listed in a single file. The
first line grants access to all services to every local host and
every host in the <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> domain. The
second line gives the remote host
<em class="emphasis">eds.oreilly.com</em> access through FTP and Telnet.
The third line is the same as having the line <tt class="literal">ALL</tt>
<tt class="literal">:</tt> <tt class="literal">ALL</tt> in the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file; it denies all other hosts
access to all of the services. Using the ALLOW and DENY options, the
command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL: .wrotethebook.com EXCEPT public.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>can be rewritten as: </p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ALL: .wrotethebook.com : ALLOW
ALL: public.wrotethebook.com : DENY</pre></blockquote>

<p>The shell command example using the original syntax is almost
identical in the new syntax:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">in.rshd : ALL: spawn (safe_finger -l @%h | /usr/sbin/mail -s %d - %h root) &amp; : DENY</pre></blockquote>

<p>A more interesting variation on the shell command theme comes from
using the <tt class="literal">twist</tt> option. Instead of passing a
command to the shell for execution, the <tt class="literal">twist</tt>
command executes a program for the remote user, but not the program
the user expects. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">in.ftpd : ALL: twist /bin/echo 421 FTP not allowed from %h : DENY</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this case, when the remote user attempts to start the FTP daemon,
<tt class="literal">echo</tt> is started instead. The
<tt class="literal">echo</tt> program then sends the message to the remote
system and terminates the connection.
</p>

<p>The extended wrapper syntax is rarely used because everything can be
done with the traditional syntax. It is useful to understand the
syntax so that you can read it when you encounter it, but it is
unlikely that you will feel the need to use it. An alternative to
wrapper that you will encounter is <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt>. It
replaces <tt class="literal">inetd</tt> and adds access controls. The
basics of <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> are covered in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Basic Configuration "</a>. Here we focus on the access controls that it
provides.

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.5.2. Controlling Access with xinetd</h3>

<p>As noted <a name="INDEX-2775" /> <a name="INDEX-2776" />in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Basic Configuration "</a>, most
of the information in the <em class="emphasis">xinetd.conf</em> file
parallels values found in the <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> file.
What <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> adds are capabilities similar to those
of wrapper. <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> reads the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.allow</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts.deny</em> files and implements the access
controls defined in those files. Additionally,
<tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> provides its own logging
<a name="INDEX-2777" />and its own
access controls. If your system uses <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt>, you
will probably create <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> and
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> files to enhance the security of
services, such as <tt class="literal">portmapper</tt>, that read those
files, and you will use the security features of
<tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> because those features provide improved
access controls.
</p>

<p><tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> provides two logging parameters:
<tt class="literal">log_on_success</tt> and
<tt class="literal">log_on_failure</tt>. Use these parameters to customize
the standard log entry made when a connection is successful or when a
connection attempt fails. <tt class="literal">log_on_success</tt> and
<tt class="literal">log_on_failure</tt> accept the following options:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2778" /><dt><i>USERID</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs the user ID of the remote user. USERID can be logged for both
successful and failed connection attempts.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2779" /><dt><i>HOST</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs the address of the remote host. Like USERID, HOST can be used
for both success and failure.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2780" /><dt><i>PID</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs the process ID of the server started to handle the connection.
PID applies only to <tt class="literal">log_on_success</tt>.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2781" /><dt><i>DURATION</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs the length of time that the server handling this connection ran.
DURATION applies only to <tt class="literal">log_on_success</tt>.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2782" /><dt><i>EXIT</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs the exit status of the server when the connection terminates.
EXIT applies only to <tt class="literal">log_on_success</tt>.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2783" /><dt><i>ATTEMPT</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs unsuccessful connection attempts. ATTEMPT applies only to
<tt class="literal">log_on_failure</tt>.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2784" /><dt><i>RECORD</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logs the connection information received from the remote server.
RECORD applies only to <tt class="literal">log_on_failure</tt>.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition to logging, <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> provides three
parameters for access control. Use these parameters to configure
<tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> to accept connections from certain hosts,
paralleling the <em class="emphasis">hosts.allow</em> file, to reject
connections from certain hosts, paralleling the
<em class="emphasis">hosts.deny</em> file, and to accept connections only
at certain times of the day. The three parameters are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2785" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">only_from</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This parameter identifies the hosts that are allowed to connect to
the service. Hosts can be defined using:
</p>


<ul><li>
<p>a numeric address. For example, 172.16.12.5 defines a specific host,
and 129.6.0.0 defines all hosts with an address that begins with
129.6. The address 0.0.0.0 matches all addresses.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>an address scope. For example, 172.16.12.{3,6,8,23} defines four
different hosts: 172.16.12.3, 172.16.12.6, 172.16.12.8, and
172.16.12.23.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>a network name. The network name must be defined in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/networks</em> file.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>a canonical hostname. The IP address provided by the remote system
must reverse-map to this hostname.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>a domain name. The hostname returned by the reverse lookup must be in
the specified domain. For example, the value
<tt class="literal">.wrotethebook.com</tt> requires a host in the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> domain. Note that when a domain
name is used, it starts with a dot.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>an IP address with an associated address mask. For example,
172.16.12.128/25 would match every address from 172.16.12.128 to
172.16.12.255.
</p>
</li></ul>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2786" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">no_access</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This parameter defines the hosts that are denied access to the
service. Hosts are defined using exactly the same methods as those
described for the <tt class="literal">only_from</tt> attribute.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2787" /><dt><b><tt class="literal">access_times</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This parameter defines the time of day a service is available, in the
form
<em class="replaceable">hour</em><tt class="literal">:</tt><em class="replaceable">min</em><tt class="literal">-</tt><em class="replaceable">hour</em><tt class="literal">:</tt><em class="replaceable">min</em>.
A 24-hour clock is used. Hours are 0 to 23 and minutes are 0 to 59.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>If neither <tt class="literal">only_from</tt> nor
<tt class="literal">no_access</tt> is specified, access is granted to
everyone. If both are specified, the most exact match
applies -- for example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">no_access            = 172.16.12.250
only_from            = 172.16.12.0</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">only_from</tt> command in this example permits
every system on network 172.16.12.0 to have access to the service.
The <tt class="literal">no_access</tt> command takes away that access for
one system. It doesn't matter whether the
<tt class="literal">no_access</tt> command comes before or after the
<tt class="literal">only_from</tt> command. It always works the same way
because the more exact match takes precedence.
</p>

<p>A sample POP3 entry from <em class="emphasis">xinetd.conf</em> is shown
below:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># default: on 
# description: The POP3 service allows remote users to access their mail \
#              using an POP3 client such as Netscape Communicator, mutt, \
#              or fetchmail.

service login
{
        socket_type             = stream
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        log_on_success          += USERID
        log_on_failure          += USERID
        only_from               = 172.16.12.0
        no_access               = 172.16.12.231
        server                  = /usr/sbin/ipop3d
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>In the sample, the <tt class="literal">only_from</tt> command permits
access from every system on network 172.16.12.0, which is the local
network for this sample system, and blocks access from all other
systems. Additionally, there is one system on subnet 17.16.12.0 (host
172.16.12.231) that is not trusted to have POP access. The
<tt class="literal">no_access</tt> command denies access to anyone on the
system 172.16.12.231.
</p>

<p>Remember that wrapper and <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> can only control
access to services. These tools cannot limit access to data on the
system or moving across the network. For that, you <a name="INDEX-2788" /> <a name="INDEX-2789" />need encryption.
