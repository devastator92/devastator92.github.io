<h2 class="sect1">10.7. Modifying a sendmail.cf File </h2>

<p>In this section
<a name="INDEX-2260" />
<a name="INDEX-2261" />
<a name="INDEX-2262" />
<a name="INDEX-2263" />we put
into practice everything we discussed about sendmail configuration
files -- their structure and the commands used to build them.
We'll modify the configuration file,
<em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em>, for use on
<em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em>. We'll modify this
particular file because its configuration is closest to the
configuration we need for
<em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em>.
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em> is a Linux workstation on a TCP/IP
Ethernet, and it uses SMTP mail and DNS.
</p>

<p>The following sections are titled according to the sections of the
file, and they describe the modifications we'll make to the
file, section by section. Remember that other
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> files will probably use different
section titles, but the basic information provided in the
configuration will be the same.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-10-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.7.1. Modifying Local Information </h3>

<p>The first line <a name="INDEX-2264" />
<a name="INDEX-2265" /> <a name="INDEX-2266" />
<a name="INDEX-2267" />in the local information section
of the configuration file defines
<a name="INDEX-2268" />
<a name="INDEX-2269" />
<a name="INDEX-2270" />class
w.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-123">[123]</a> Class w is the full set of
hostnames for which this system accepts mail. Use the
<tt class="literal">C</tt> command or the <tt class="literal">F</tt> command to
add hostnames to this set. sendmail initializes this class to the
value in macro w (<tt class="literal">$w</tt>), which is the hostname of
this computer. On many systems that is enough. However, sometimes a
sendmail server acts as a mailbox server that must accept and store
mail for clients that do not directly receive SMTP mail. The w class
needs to identify systems that expect this host to accept mail for
them. You'll need to add a hostname to class w for every
mailbox client.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-123" /><p>[123]The <tt class="literal">C</tt> and <tt class="literal">F</tt>
commands from <em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> are shown earlier
in this chapter.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In our sample, we accept the <tt class="literal">Cw</tt> command as
written, and let sendmail define the value for w internally. This is
the most common method for desktop systems like
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em>. On the system <em class="emphasis">crab</em>,
which is also known by the name <em class="emphasis">wtb-gw</em>, we would
add values to class w as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> Cwlocalhost wtb-gw wtb-gw.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now mail addressed to
<em class="emphasis">user@wtb-gw.wrotethebook.com</em> would be accepted
by <em class="emphasis">crab</em> and not rejected as being addressed to
the wrong host.
</p>

<p>Some mail servers might need to be configured to accept mail for many
different hostnames. In that case, you may want to load class w from
a file containing all the hostnames. You can do that with the
<tt class="literal">F</tt> command. The
<em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> file already has an
<tt class="literal">F</tt> command, so we could just place the client
hostnames in the file
<em class="emphasis">/etc/mail/local-host-names</em>.
</p>

<p>No modification is necessary for the j macro definition because, on
this system, sendmail obtains a fully qualified domain name for the j
macro from DNS. On most systems this is the case; on other systems
sendmail obtains the hostname without the domain extension. If j
doesn't contain the full name, initialize j with the hostname
(<tt class="literal">$w</tt>) and the domain name. In the sample file, we
would do this by "uncommenting" the <tt class="literal">Dj</tt>
command and editing the domain string to be
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>. However, there is no need to
do this because j has the correct value.
</p>

<p>To test if j is set to the <a name="INDEX-2271" />correct value on your system, run
sendmail with the <tt class="literal">-bt</tt> option and the debug level
set to 0.4. In response to this, sendmail displays several lines of
information, including the value of j. In the example below, sendmail
displays the value <em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em> for
j. If it displayed only <em class="emphasis">rodent</em>, we would edit
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> to correct the value for j.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>sendmail -bt -d0.4</b></tt> 
Version 8.11.3 
 Compiled with: LOG MATCHGECOS MIME8TO7 NAMED_BIND NDBM

      (short domain name) $w = rodent 
  (canonical domain name) $j = rodent.wrotethebook.com  
         (subdomain name) $m = wrotethebook.com

======================================================== 
 
ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked) 
Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt; &gt; <tt class="userinput"><b>^D</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>The next line in the local information section defines class P. In
our sample configuration file,
<a name="INDEX-2272" />
<a name="INDEX-2273" />class
P stores the names of two pseudo-domains. These pseudo-domain names
are "." and REDIRECT. The pseudo-domain dot (.) is used
to identify canonical domain names. The REDIRECT pseudo-domain is
used by the redirect feature described in <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a>. Other pseudo-domains can be added to class P
to address users who are not on the Internet with Internet-style
email addresses. For example, we could add UUCP to class P so that
mail can be addressed using the old UUCP "bang" syntax,
e.g., <em class="emphasis">ora!los!craig</em>, or it can be addressed in a
pseudo-Internet format, e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">craig@los.ora.uucp</em>. These mail routing domains
simplify the address that the user enters and route the mail to the
correct mail relay host. However, additional pseudo-domains are
rarely needed because most mailers now support standard
Internet-style addresses. The class P definition in
<em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> does not require any
modification.
</p>

<p>The configuration file has macro definitions for several mail relays.
None of these are assigned a value in our sample file. You only need
a relay host if your system cannot deliver the mail because it lacks
capability or connectivity. Unix systems do not lack capability, but
a firewall might limit connectivity. Some sites use a mail relay so
that only one system needs a full <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em>
configuration. The other hosts at the site simply forward their mail
to the smart host for delivery. If this is the configuration policy
of your site, enter the name of the mail relay as the
"smart" relay. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> DSrelay.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>We don't enter anything in any of the relay settings on
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em>. This desktop system will handle all its
own mail. Hey, that's why we run Unix!
</p>

<p>The local information
<a name="INDEX-2274" />section in the sample file also includes
five key file definitions. Two of these <tt class="literal">K</tt> commands
define pseudo-databases, which are internal sendmail routines used in
rewrite rules as if they were true databases. The
<em class="emphasis">arith</em> database is an internal routine used to
perform certain arithmetic functions. The
<em class="emphasis">dequote</em> database is an internal sendmail routine
used to remove quotes from within email addresses. The other three
<tt class="literal">K</tt> commands define real databases:
<em class="emphasis">mailertable</em>, <em class="emphasis">virtuser,</em> and
<em class="emphasis">access</em>. These are real databases, but the
database files exist only if you create them. The
<em class="emphasis">mailertable</em> database is used to send mail
addressed to a specific domain through a particular mailer to a
specific remote host. The <em class="emphasis">virtuser</em> database
routes mail for virtual mail domains, which are mail domains that
have no real existence beyond the sendmail server itself. The
<em class="emphasis">access</em> database provides access controls for
mail relaying and for spam control.
</p>

<p>The version number <a name="INDEX-2275" />doesn't
<em class="emphasis">require</em> modification -- but it's a good
idea to keep track of the changes you make to your
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file, and this is the place to do
it. Each time you modify the configuration, change the version number
by adding your own revision number. At the same time, enter a comment
in the file describing the changes you made. Usually, this is the
last change made to the files so the comments reflect all changes.
For example, the original version number section in the
<em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> file is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">###################### 
#   Version Number   # 
###################### 
 DZ8.11.3</pre></blockquote>

<p>After we have finished all of our modifications, it will contain: </p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">###################### 
#   Version Number   # 
###################### 
#  R1.0 - modified for rodent by Craig 
#       - cleaned up the comments in the local info section 
#  R1.1 - modified macro M to use wrotethebook.com instead of the 
#         hostname in outgoing mail 
#  R2.0 - added rule a to SEnvFromSMTP &amp; S HdrFromSMTP to rewrite
          the user in outgoing mail to firstname.lastname format 
 DZ8.11.3R2.0</pre></blockquote>

<p>Finally, we need to understand the purpose of a few other classes and
macros found in this section. The M macro is used to rewrite the
sender host address. Define a value for M to hide the name of the
local host in outbound mail. Classes E and M are both related to
macro M. Class E
<a name="INDEX-2276" />
<a name="INDEX-2277" />defines
the usernames for which the hostname is not rewritten even if the M
macro is defined. For example,
<em class="emphasis">root@rodent.wrotethebook.com</em> is not rewritten to
<em class="emphasis">root@wrotethebook.com</em> even if M is defined as
DMwrotethebook.com. Class M
<a name="INDEX-2278" />
<a name="INDEX-2279" />defines
other hostnames, not just the local hostname, that should be
rewritten to the value of macro M. This is used on mail servers that
might need to rewrite sender addresses for their clients. For
example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># who I masquerade as (null for no masquerading) (see also $=M) 
DMwrotethebook.com 
 
# class M: domains that should be converted to $M CM24seven.wrotethebook.com brazil.
wrotethebook.com ora.wrotethebook.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>Given the macro M and class M definitions shown above, this host
would rewrite mail from
<em class="emphasis">user@brazil.wrotethebook.com</em> or
<em class="emphasis">user@24seven.wrotethebook.com</em> to
<em class="emphasis">user@wrotethebook.com</em>.
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em> is not a server so we won't use
class M. But we will use macro M later in the configuration.
</p>

<p>We've spent lots of time looking at the local information
section because almost everything you will need to do to configure a
system can be done here. We will quickly discuss the other section
before getting into the really challenging task of working with
rewrite <a name="INDEX-2280" /> <a name="INDEX-2281" /> <a name="INDEX-2282" /> <a name="INDEX-2283" />rules. 
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-10-SECT-7.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.7.2. Modifying Options </h3>

<p>The section "Options" defines
<a name="INDEX-2284" />
<a name="INDEX-2285" />
<a name="INDEX-2286" />
<a name="INDEX-2287" />the sendmail environment. For example,
some of the options specify the file paths used by sendmail, as in
these lines from the <em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># location of alias file 
O AliasFile=/etc/mail/aliases 
# location of help file 
O HelpFile=/etc/mail/helpfile 
# status file 
O StatusFile=/etc/mail/statistics 
# queue directory
O QueueDirectory=/var/spool/mqueue</pre></blockquote>

<p>If these paths are correct for your system, don't modify them.
On <em class="emphasis">rodent</em> we want to keep the files just where
they are, which is generally the case when you use a
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file that was designed for your
operating system. In fact, you will probably not need to change any
of the options if you use a configuration file designed for your
operating system. If you're really curious about sendmail
options, see <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a>.
</p>

<p>The next few sections of the <em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em>
file define the messages' precedences, the trusted users, and
the headers. None of these sections is modified. Following these
sections are the rewrite rules and the mailers. This material is the
bulk of the file and the heart of the configuration. The sample
configuration file is designed to allow SMTP mail delivery on a Linux
system running DNS, so we assume no modifications are required. We
want to test the configuration before copying it into
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em>. We'll save it in a temporary
configuration file, <em class="emphasis">test.cf</em>, and use the
troubleshooting features of sendmail to test it.
