<h2 class="sect1">3.3. DNS</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-524" />
<a name="INDEX-525" />DNS overcomes
both major weaknesses of the host table:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>DNS
<a name="INDEX-526" />scales
well. It doesn't rely on a single large table; it is a
distributed database system that doesn't bog down as the
database grows. DNS currently provides information on approximately
100,000,000 hosts, while fewer than 10,000 were listed in the host
table.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>DNS guarantees that new host information will be disseminated to the
rest of the network as it is needed.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Information is automatically disseminated, and only to those who are
interested. Here's how it works. If a DNS server receives a
request for information about a host for which it has no information,
it passes on the request to an<a name="INDEX-527" />
<em class="emphasis">authoritative server</em>.<a name="INDEX-528" />
<a name="INDEX-529" /> An authoritative server is any
server responsible for maintaining accurate information about the
domain being queried. When the authoritative server answers, the
local server saves, or
<em class="emphasis">caches</em><a name="INDEX-530" />,
the answer for future use. The next time the local server receives a
request for this information, it answers the request itself. The
ability to control host information from an authoritative source and
to automatically disseminate accurate information makes DNS superior
to the host table, even for networks not connected to the Internet.
</p>

<p>In addition to superseding the host table, DNS also replaces an
earlier form of name service. Unfortunately, both the old and new
services were called <em class="emphasis">name service</em>. Both are
listed in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file. In that file,
the old software is assigned UDP port 42 and is called
<em class="emphasis">nameserver</em> or <em class="emphasis">name</em>; DNS
name service is assigned
<a name="INDEX-531" />port
53 and is called <em class="emphasis">domain</em>. Naturally, there is
some confusion between the two name servers. There shouldn't
be -- the old name service is outdated. This text discusses DNS
only; when we refer to "name service," we always mean
DNS.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.1. The Domain Hierarchy</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-532" />
<a name="INDEX-533" />DNS is a distributed hierarchical
system for resolving hostnames into IP addresses. Under DNS, there is
no central database with all of the Internet host information. The
information is distributed among thousands of name servers organized
into a hierarchy similar to the hierarchy of the Unix filesystem. DNS
has a <em class="emphasis">root domain</em> at the
<a name="INDEX-534" />top of the
domain hierarchy that is served by a group of name servers called the
<a name="INDEX-535" />
<a name="INDEX-536" /><em class="emphasis">root
servers</em>.
</p>

<p>Just as directories in the Unix filesystem are found by following a
path from the root directory through subordinate directories to the
target directory, information about a domain is found by tracing
pointers from the root domain through subordinate domains to the
target domain.
</p>

<p>Directly under the root domain are the <em class="emphasis">top-level
domains</em>. There <a name="INDEX-537" /> <a name="INDEX-538" />
<a name="INDEX-539" />are
two basic types of top-level domains -- geographic and
organizational.<a name="INDEX-540" /> Geographic domains have been set aside
for each country in the world and are identified by a two-letter
country code. Thus, this type of domain is called a <em class="emphasis">country
code top-level domain</em> (ccTLD). For example, the ccTLD for
the United Kingdom is <em class="emphasis">.uk</em>, for Japan it is
<em class="emphasis">.jp</em>, and for the United States it is
<em class="emphasis">.us</em>. When <em class="emphasis">.us</em> is used as
the top-level domain, the second-level domain is usually a
state's two-letter postal abbreviation (e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">.wy.us</em> for Wyoming). U.S. geographic domains are
usually used by state governments and K-12 schools but are not widely
used for other hosts.
</p>

<p>Within the United States, the most popular top-level domains are
<a name="INDEX-541" />organizational -- that is, membership
in a domain is based on the type of organization (commercial,
military, etc.) to which the system belongs.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-19">[19]</a> These domains are called <em class="emphasis">generic top-level
domains</em> or <em class="emphasis">general-purpose top-level
domains</em> (gTLDs).
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-19" /><p>[19]There is
no relationship between the organizational and geographic domains in
the U.S. Each system belongs to either an organizational domain
<em class="emphasis">or</em> a geographic domain, not both. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The official generic top-level domains are:</p>

<p>These are the fourteen current gTLDs. The first seven domains in the
list (<em class="emphasis">com</em>, <em class="emphasis">edu</em>,
<em class="emphasis">gov</em>, <em class="emphasis">mil</em>,
<em class="emphasis">net</em>, <em class="emphasis">int</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">org</em>) have been part of the domain system since
the beginning. The last seven domains in the list
(<em class="emphasis">aero</em>, <em class="emphasis">biz</em>,
<em class="emphasis">coop</em>, <em class="emphasis">museum</em>,
<em class="emphasis">pro</em>, <em class="emphasis">info</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">name</em>) were added in 2000 to increase the number
of top-level domains. One motivation for creating the new gTLDs is
the huge size of the <em class="emphasis">.com</em> domain. It is so large
that it is difficult to maintain an efficient
<em class="emphasis">.com</em> database. Whether or not these new gTLDs
will be effective in drawing registrations away from the
<em class="emphasis">.com</em> domain remains to be seen.
</p>

<p><a href="ch03_03.html#tcp3-CHP-3-FIG-1">Figure 3-1</a> illustrates the domain hierarchy using
six of the original organizational top-level domains. At the top is
the root. Directly below the root domain are the top-level domains.
The root servers have complete information only about the top-level
domains. No servers, not even the root servers, have complete
information about all domains, but the root servers have pointers to
the servers for the second-level domains.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-20">[20]</a> So while the root
servers may not know the answer to a query, they know who to ask.

<h3 class="sect2">3.3.2. Creating Domains and Subdomains</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-556" />
<a name="INDEX-557" />Several domain name registrars have
been authorized by the <a name="INDEX-558" /><a name="INDEX-559" /> <a name="INDEX-560" />Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nonprofit organization that was formed
to take over the responsibility for allocating domain names and IP
addresses. (Previously, the U.S. government oversaw this process.)
ICANN has authorized these registrars to allocate domains. To obtain
a domain, you apply to a registrar for authority to create a domain
under one of the top-level domains. (The details of applying for a
domain name are covered in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Getting Started"</a>.) Once the
authority to create a domain is granted, you can create additional
domains, called <em class="emphasis">subdomains</em>, under your
<a name="INDEX-561" />domain.
Let's look at how this works at our imaginary company.
</p>

<p>Our company is a commercial, profit-making (we hope) enterprise. It
clearly falls into the <em class="emphasis">com</em> domain. We apply for
authority to create a domain named <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook</em>
within the <em class="emphasis">com</em> domain. The request for the new
domain contains the hostnames and addresses of the servers that will
provide name service for the new domain. When the registrar approves
the request, it adds pointers in the <em class="emphasis">com</em> domain
to the new domain's name servers. Now when queries are received
by the root servers for the <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>
domain, the queries are referred to the new name servers.
</p>

<p>The registrar's approval grants us complete authority over our
new domain. Any registered domain has authority to divide its domain
into subdomains. Our imaginary company can create separate domains
for the division that handles special events
(<em class="emphasis">events.wrotethebook.com</em>) and for the division
that coordinates the preparation of magazine articles
(<em class="emphasis">articles.wrotethebook.com</em>) without consulting
the registrar or any other "higher authority." The
decision to add subdomains is completely up to the local domain
administrator. The registrars delegate authority and distribute
control over names to individual organizations. Once that authority
has been delegated, the individual organization is responsible for
managing the names it has been assigned.
</p>

<p>A new subdomain becomes accessible when pointers to the servers for
the new domain are placed in the domain above it (see <a href="ch03_03.html#tcp3-CHP-3-FIG-1">Figure 3-1</a>). Remote servers cannot locate the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> domain until a pointer to its
server is placed in the <em class="emphasis">com</em> domain. Likewise,
the subdomains <em class="emphasis">events</em> and
<em class="emphasis">articles</em> cannot be accessed until pointers to
them are placed in <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>. The DNS
database record that points to the name servers for a domain is the
NS (<em class="emphasis">name server</em>) <a name="INDEX-562" />
<a name="INDEX-563" /> <a name="INDEX-564" />record. This record contains the name
of the domain and the name of the host that is a server for that
domain. <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a> discusses the actual DNS
database. For now, let's just think of these records as
pointers.
</p>

<p><a href="ch03_03.html#tcp3-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</a> illustrates how the NS records are used
as pointers. A local server has a request to resolve
<em class="emphasis">linuxuser.articles.wrotethebook.com</em> into an IP
address. The server has no information on
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> in its cache, so it queries a
root server (<em class="emphasis">a.root-servers.net</em> in our example)
for the address. The root server replies with an NS record that
points to <em class="emphasis">crab.wrotethebook.com</em> as the source of
information on <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>. The local
server queries <em class="emphasis">crab</em>, which points it to
<em class="emphasis">linuxmag.articles.wrotethebook.com</em> as the server
for <em class="emphasis">articles.wrotethebook.com</em>. The local server
then queries <em class="emphasis">linuxmag.articles.wrotethebook.com</em>
and finally receives the desired IP address. The local server caches
the A (address) record and each of the NS records. The next time it
has a query for
<em class="emphasis">linuxuser.articles.wrotethebook.com</em>, it will
answer the query itself. And the next time the server has a query for
other information in the <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>
domain, it will go directly to <em class="emphasis">crab</em> without
involving a root server.

<p><a href="ch03_03.html#tcp3-CHP-3-FIG-2">Figure 3-2</a> provides examples of both recursive and
nonrecursive searches. The remote servers are examples of
<em class="emphasis">nonrecursive</em> <a name="INDEX-566" />servers. The remote servers tell
the local server who to ask next. The local server must follow the
pointers itself. The local server is an example of a
<em class="emphasis">recursive</em> server. In a
<em class="emphasis">recursive</em> <a name="INDEX-567" />search, the server follows the pointers
and returns the final answer for the query. The root servers
generally perform only <em class="emphasis">nonrecursive</em> searches.
ost other servers perform recursive searches.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-3.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.3. Domain Names</h3>

<p>Domain names <a name="INDEX-568" />reflect the domain hierarchy. They are
written from most specific (a hostname) to least specific (a
top-level domain), with each part of the domain name separated by a
dot.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-21">[21]</a> A <a name="INDEX-569" /> <a name="INDEX-570" /><em class="emphasis">fully qualified
domain name</em> (FQDN) starts with a specific host and ends
with a top-level domain. <em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em>
is the FQDN of workstation <em class="emphasis">rodent</em>, in the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook</em> domain, of the
<em class="emphasis">com</em> domain.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-21" /><p>[21]The root domain is identified by a single dot;
i.e., the root name is a null name written simply as
"<tt class="literal">.</tt>"<tt class="literal">.</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Domain names are not always written as fully qualified domain names.
They can be written relative to a <em class="emphasis">default domain</em>
in the same way that Unix pathnames are written relative to the
current (default) working directory. DNS adds the default domain to
the user input when constructing the query for the name server. For
example, if the default domain is
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>, a user can omit the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> extension for any hostnames in
that domain. <em class="emphasis">crab.wrotethebook.com</em> could be
addressed simply as <em class="emphasis">crab</em>; DNS adds the default
domain <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>.
</p>

<p>On most systems, the <a name="INDEX-571" />default domain name is added only if there
is no dot in the requested hostname. For example,
<em class="emphasis">linuxuser.articles</em> would not be extended and
would therefore not be resolved by the name server because
<em class="emphasis">articles</em> is not a valid top-level domain. But
the hostname <em class="emphasis">crab</em>, which contains no dot, would
be extended with <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em>, giving the
valid domain name <em class="emphasis">crab.wrotethebook.com</em>. Like
almost everything on a Unix system, this behavior is configurable, as
you'll see in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a>.
</p>

<p>How the default domain is used and how queries are constructed vary
depending on the software configuration. For this reason, you should
exercise caution when embedding a hostname in a program. Only a fully
qualified domain name or an IP address is immune from changes in the
name server software.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-3.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.4. BIND, Resolvers, and named</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-572" />
<a name="INDEX-573" />The
implementation of DNS used on Unix systems is the <em class="emphasis">Berkeley
Internet Name Domain</em><a name="INDEX-574" /> (BIND) software.
Descriptions in this text are based on the BIND name server
implementation.
</p>

<p>DNS software is conceptually divided into two components -- a
resolver and a name server. The <em class="emphasis">resolver</em>
<a name="INDEX-575" />is the software that forms the query;
it asks the questions. The <em class="emphasis">name server</em>
<a name="INDEX-576" />is the
process that responds to the query; it answers the questions.
</p>

<p>The resolver does not exist as a distinct process running on the
computer. Rather, the resolver is a library of software routines
(called the <em class="emphasis">resolver code</em>)
<a name="INDEX-577" />that is linked
into any program that needs to look up addresses. This library knows
how to ask the name server for host information.
</p>

<p>Under BIND, all computers use resolver code, but not all computers
run the name server process. A computer that does not run a local
name server process and relies on other systems for all name service
answers is called a <em class="emphasis">resolver-only</em> system.
Resolver-only <a name="INDEX-578" />configurations are common on
single-user systems. Larger Unix systems usually run a local name
server process.
</p>

<p>The BIND name server runs as a distinct process called
<em class="emphasis">named</em> <a name="INDEX-579" />(pronounced "name"
"d"). Name servers are classified differently depending
on how they are configured. The three main categories of name servers
are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Master</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-580" />
<a name="INDEX-581" />
<a name="INDEX-582" /> <a name="INDEX-583" />The <em class="emphasis">master server</em>
(also called the <em class="emphasis">primary server)</em> is the server
from which all data about a domain is derived. The master server
loads the domain's information directly from a disk file
created by the domain administrator. Master servers are
<em class="emphasis">authoritative</em>, <a name="INDEX-584" />meaning they have complete information
about their domain and their responses are always accurate. There
should be only one master server for a domain.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Slave</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><em class="emphasis">Slave servers</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">secondary
servers</em>) <a name="INDEX-585" /> <a name="INDEX-586" />transfer the entire domain database from
the master server. A particular domain's database file is
called a <em class="emphasis">zone file</em>; copying this file to a slave
server is called a <a name="INDEX-587" /><em class="emphasis">zone file transfer</em>. A
slave server assures that it has current information about a domain
by periodically transferring the domain's zone file. Slave
servers are also authoritative for their domain.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Caching-only</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-588" /><em class="emphasis">Caching-only
servers</em> get the answers to all name service queries from
other name servers. Once a caching server has received an answer to a
query, it caches the information and will use it in the future to
answer queries itself. Most name servers cache answers and use them
in this way. What makes the caching-only server unique is that this
is the only technique it uses to build its domain database. Caching
servers are <em class="emphasis">non-authoritative</em>,
<a name="INDEX-589" />meaning that their information is
second-hand and incomplete, though usually accurate.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The relationship between the different types of servers is an
advantage that DNS has over the host table for most networks, even
very small networks. Under DNS, there should be only one primary name
server for each domain. DNS data is entered into the primary
server's database by the domain administrator.
<a name="INDEX-590" />Therefore, the administrator has
central control of the hostname information. An automatically
distributed, centrally controlled database is an advantage for a
network of any size. When you add a new system to the network, you
don't need to modify the <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> files
on every node in the network; you modify only the DNS database on the
primary server. The information is automatically disseminated to the
other servers by full zone transfers or by caching single answers.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-3-SECT-3.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.5. Network Information Service</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-591" />
<a name="INDEX-592" />The Network
Information Service (NIS)<a href="#FOOTNOTE-22">[22]</a> is an administrative database system
developed by Sun Microsystems. It provides central control and
automatic dissemination of important administrative files. NIS can be
used in conjunction with DNS or as an alternative to it.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-22" /><p>[22]NIS was formerly called the
"Yellow Pages," or <em class="emphasis">yp</em>. Although the
name has changed, the abbreviation <em class="emphasis">yp</em> is still
used.</p> </blockquote>

<p>NIS and DNS have similarities and differences. Like
<a name="INDEX-593" />DNS, the Network Information Service
overcomes the problem of accurately distributing the host table, but
unlike DNS, it provides service only for local area networks. NIS is
not intended as a service for the Internet as a whole. Another
difference is that NIS provides access to a wider range of
information than DNS -- much more than name-to-address
conversions. It converts several standard Unix files into databases
that can be queried over the network. These databases are called
<em class="emphasis">NIS maps</em>. <a name="INDEX-594" />
<a name="INDEX-595" />
</p>

<p>NIS converts files such as <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> and
<a name="INDEX-596" /><em class="emphasis">/etc/networks</em> into
maps. The maps can be stored on a central server where they can be
centrally maintained while still being fully accessible to the NIS
clients. Because the maps can be both centrally maintained and
automatically disseminated to users, NIS overcomes a major weakness
of the host table. But NIS is not an alternative to DNS for Internet
hosts because the host table, and therefore NIS, contains only a
fraction of the information available to DNS. For this reason DNS and
NIS are usually used together.
</p>

<p>This chapter has introduced the concept of hostnames and provided an
overview of the various techniques used to translate hostnames into
IP addresses. This is by no means the complete story. Assigning
hostnames and managing name service are important tasks for the
network administrator. These topics are revisited several times in
this book and discussed in extensive detail in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a>. 
</p>

<p>Name service is not the only service that you will install on your
network. Another service that you are sure to use is electronic mail.
