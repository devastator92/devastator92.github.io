<h2 class="sect1">2.4. The Routing Table</h2>

<p>Gateways route <a name="INDEX-388" />
<a name="INDEX-389" />data between networks, but all network
devices, hosts as well as gateways, must make routing decisions. For
most hosts, the routing decisions are simple:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>If the destination host is on the local network, the data is
delivered to the destination host.
<a name="INDEX-390" />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If the destination host is on a remote network, the data is forwarded
to a local gateway.
<a name="INDEX-391" />
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>IP routing decisions are simply table lookups. Packets are routed
toward their destinations as directed by the <em class="emphasis">routing
table</em> (also called the <em class="emphasis">forwarding
table</em>). The routing table maps destinations to the router
and network interface that IP must use to reach that destination.
Examining the routing table on a Linux system shows this.
</p>

<p>On a Linux <a name="INDEX-392" /> <a name="INDEX-393" />system, use
the <tt class="literal">route</tt> command with the <tt class="literal">-n</tt>
option to display the routing table.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-12">[12]</a> The <tt class="literal">-n</tt> option
prevents <tt class="literal">route</tt> from converting IP addresses to
hostnames, which gives a clearer display. Here is a routing table
from a sample Red Hat system:
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-12" /><p>[12]The
<tt class="literal">netstat</tt> command is used to examine the routing
table on Solaris 8 systems. A Solaris example is covered later in

<p>On a Linux system, the <tt class="literal">route</tt> <tt class="literal">-n</tt>

</dd>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">U</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates <a name="INDEX-398" />that the route is up and operational.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">H</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates <a name="INDEX-399" />that this is a route to a specific host
(most routes are to networks).
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">G</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-400" />Indicates that the route uses an external
gateway. The system's network interfaces provide routes to
directly connected networks. All other routes use external gateways.
Directly connected networks do not have the G flag set; all other
routes do.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">R</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates <a name="INDEX-401" />a route that was installed, probably by a
dynamic routing protocol running on this system, using the
<tt class="literal">reinstate</tt> option.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">D</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-402" />Indicates that this route was added
because of an ICMP Redirect Message.<a name="INDEX-403" /> When a system learns of a route
via an ICMP Redirect, it adds the route to its routing table so that
additional packets bound for that destination will not need to be
redirected. The system uses the D flag to mark these routes.

</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">C</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates <a name="INDEX-406" />that this route came from the kernel
routing cache. Most systems use two routing tables: the Forwarding
Information Base (FIB), which is the table we are interested in
because it is used for the routing decision, and the kernel routing
cache, which lists the source and destination of recently used
routes. This flag is documented, but I have never seen the C flag in
a routing table listing, even when listing the routing cache.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">L</tt></b></dt>

</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">B</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates <a name="INDEX-408" />a route whose destination is a broadcast
address. These "broadcast routes" are found only in the
routing cache. Solaris assigns the flag to both broadcast addresses
and network addresses; i.e., both 172.16.255.255 and 172.16.0.0 are
given the B flag by Solaris systems that live on network
172.16.0.0/16. 
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">I</tt></b></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>

<dt><b><tt class="literal">!</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-410" />Indicates that datagrams bound for this

"negative" routes. These are routes that explicitly block
data bound for a specific destination. This is Linux-specific and

<dd>
<p>The "cost" of <a name="INDEX-411" />the route. The metric is used to

</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Ref</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number <a name="INDEX-412" />of times the route has been referenced to

</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Use</em></i></dt>

<p>The number <a name="INDEX-413" />of times this route was looked up by IP.

<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Iface</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name <a name="INDEX-414" />of the network interface<a href="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a> used by this route.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-14" /><p>[14]The <em class="emphasis">network interface</em> is the network
access hardware and software that IP uses to communicate with the
physical network. See <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring the Interface "</a> for
details.</p> </blockquote>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Each entry in the <a name="INDEX-415" />
<a name="INDEX-416" />routing table starts with a
<em class="emphasis">destination value</em>. The destination value is the
key against which the IP address is matched to determine if this is
the correct route to use to reach the IP address. The destination
value is usually called the "destination network,"
although it does not need to be a network address. The destination
value can be a host address, a multicast address, an address block
that covers an aggregation of many networks, or a special value for
the default route or loopback address. In all cases, however, the
Destination <a name="INDEX-417" />field contains the value against which
the destination address from the IP packet is matched to determine if
IP should deliver the datagram using this route.
</p>

<p>The Genmask <a name="INDEX-418" />field is the <a name="INDEX-419" />
<a name="INDEX-420" />bit mask that IP applies to the
destination address from the packet to see if the address matches the
destination value in the table. If a bit is on in the bit mask, the
corresponding bit in the destination address is significant for
matching the address. Thus, the address 172.16.50.183 would match the
second entry in the sample table because ANDing the address with
255.55.255.0 yields 172.16.50.0.
</p>

<p>When an address matches an entry in the table, the Gateway
<a name="INDEX-421" />field tells IP how to reach the specified
destination. If the Gateway field contains the IP address of a
router, the router is used. If the Gateway field contains all 0s
(0.0.0.0 when <tt class="literal">route</tt> is run with
<tt class="literal">-n</tt>) or an asterisk (* when
<tt class="literal">route</tt> is run without <tt class="literal">-n</tt>), the
destination network is a directly connected network and the
"gateway" is the computer's network interface. The
last field displayed for each table entry is the network interface
used for the route. In the example, it is either the first Ethernet
interface (<em class="emphasis">eth0</em>) or the loopback interface
(<em class="emphasis">lo</em>). The destination, gateway, mask, and
interface define the route.
</p>

<p>The remaining four fields (Ref, Use, Flags, and Metric) display
supporting information about the route. These informational
<a name="INDEX-422" />fields are of only marginal value. Some
systems keep an accurate count in the Ref <a name="INDEX-423" />field; others, such
as Linux, don't really use it. Linux uses the Use
<a name="INDEX-424" />field to count the number of times a
route needed to be looked up because it was not in the routing cache
when IP needed it. Some other systems show the number of packets
transmitted via the route in the Use field. The Flags
<a name="INDEX-425" />field displays information that is often
obvious even without the flags: every route has the U flag set
because every route in the routing table is up by definition, and
looking at the Gateway field tells you whether or not an external
gateway is used without looking for the G flag. The Metric
<a name="INDEX-426" />value is used only if you run some
version of the <a name="INDEX-427" /><a name="INDEX-428" />Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) on your system. Don't be distracted
by this information. The heart of the routing table is the route,
which is composed of the destination, the mask, the gateway, and the
interface.
</p>

<p>IP uses the information from the routing table (the forwarding table)
to construct the routes used for active connections. The routes
associated with active connections are stored in the routing
<a name="INDEX-429" />
<a name="INDEX-430" />cache. On Linux
<a name="INDEX-431" />systems, the routing cache can be
examined by adding the <tt class="literal">-C</tt> argument to the
<tt class="literal">route</tt> command line:

<p>The routing cache is different from the routing table because the
cache shows established routes. The routing table is used to make
routing decisions; the routing cache is used
<em class="emphasis">after</em> the decision is made. The routing cache
shows the source and destination of a network connection and the
gateway and interface used to make that connection.
</p>

<p>Linux provides a good example for showing the contents of the routing
table because the Linux <tt class="literal">route</tt> command displays the
table so clearly. On
<a name="INDEX-432" /> <a name="INDEX-433" />
<a name="INDEX-434" />Solaris systems, the
<tt class="literal">route</tt> command has a very different syntax. When
running Solaris, display the routing table's contents with the
<tt class="literal">netstat -nr</tt><a name="INDEX-435" />
command.<a name="INDEX-436" /> The <tt class="literal">-r</tt> option
tells <tt class="literal">netstat</tt> to display the routing table, and
the <tt class="literal">-n</tt> option tells <tt class="literal">netstat</tt> to
display the table in numeric form.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-15">[15]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-15" /><p>[15]Linux incorporates
the address mask information in the routing table display. Solaris 8
supports address masks; it just doesn't show them when

<p>The first table entry is the <em class="emphasis">loopback route</em>
<a name="INDEX-437" />
<a name="INDEX-438" />for the local host. This is the loopback
address mentioned earlier as a reserved network number. Because every
system uses the loopback route to send datagrams to itself, an entry
for the loopback interface is in every host's routing table.
The H flag is set because Solaris creates a route to a specific host
(127.0.0.1), not a route to an entire network (127.0.0.0).
We'll see the loopback facility again when we discuss kernel
configuration and the <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> command. For now,
however, our real interest is in external routes.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-439" />
<a name="INDEX-440" />
<a name="INDEX-441" />Another unique entry in this routing
table is the one with the word "default" in the
destination field. This entry is for the <em class="emphasis">default
route</em>, and the gateway specified in this entry is the
<em class="emphasis">default gateway</em>. The default route is the other
reserved network number mentioned earlier: 0.0.0.0. The default
gateway is used whenever there is no specific route in the table for
a destination network address. For example, this routing table has no
entry for network 192.168.16.0. If IP receives any datagrams
addressed to this network, it will send them via the default gateway
172.16.12.1.
</p>

<p>All of the gateways that appear in the routing table are on networks
directly connected to the local system. In the sample shown above,
this means that the gateway addresses all begin with 172.16.12
regardless of the destination address. This is the only network to
which this sample host is directly attached, and therefore it is the
only network to which it can directly deliver data. The gateways that
a host uses to reach the rest of the Internet must be on its subnet.
</p>

<p>In <a href="ch02_04.html#tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-4">Figure 2-4</a>, the IP layer of two hosts and a
gateway on our imaginary network is replaced by a small piece of a
routing table, showing destination networks and the gateways used to
reach those destinations. Assume that the address mask used for
network 172.16.0.0 is 255.255.255.0. When the source host
(172.16.12.2) sends data to the destination host (172.16.1.2), it
applies the address mask to determine that it should look for the
destination network address 172.16.1.0 in the routing table. The
routing table in the source host shows that data bound for 172.16.1.0
is sent to gateway 172.16.12.3. The source host forwards the packet
to the gateway. The gateway does the same steps and looks up the
destination address in its routing table. Gateway 172.16.12.3 then
makes direct delivery through its 172.16.1.5 interface. Examining the
routing tables in <a href="ch02_04.html#tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-4">Figure 2-4</a> shows that all systems
list only gateways on networks to which they are directly connected.
This is illustrated by the fact that 172.16.12.1 is the default
gateway for both 172.16.12.2 and 172.16.12.3, but because 172.16.1.2
cannot reach network 172.16.12.0 directly, it has a different default
route.

<p>A routing table does not contain end-to-end
routes.<a name="INDEX-442" />
<a name="INDEX-443" /> A route points only to the next
gateway, called the <em class="emphasis">next hop</em>, along the path to
the destination network.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-16">[16]</a> The host
relies on the local gateway to deliver the data, and the gateway
relies on other gateways. As a datagram moves from one gateway to
another, it should eventually reach one that is directly connected to
its destination network. It is this last gateway that finally
delivers the data to the destination host.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-16" /><p>[16]As we'll see in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Configuring Routing "</a>, some routing protocols, such as OSPF and BGP,
obtain end-to-end routing information. Nevertheless, the packet is
still passed to the next-hop router.</p> </blockquote>

<p>IP uses the network portion of the address to route the datagram
between networks. The full address, including the host information,
is used to make final delivery when the datagram reaches the
destination network.
