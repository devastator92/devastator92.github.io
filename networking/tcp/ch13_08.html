<h2 class="sect1">13.8. Protocol Case Study </h2>

<p>This example is <a name="INDEX-2972" /> <a name="INDEX-2973" /> <a name="INDEX-2974" />an
actual case that was solved by protocol analysis. The problem was
reported as an occasional <tt class="literal">ftp</tt> failure with the
error message:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">netout: Option not supported by protocol 421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection</pre></blockquote>

<p>Only one user reported the problem, and it occurred only when
transferring large files from a workstation to the central computer
via our backbone network.
</p>

<p>We obtained the user's data file and were able to duplicate the
problem from other workstations, but only when we transferred the
file to the same central system via the backbone network. <a href="ch13_08.html#tcp3-CHP-13-FIG-4">Figure 13-4</a> graphically summarizes the tests we ran to
duplicate the problem.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-FIG-4" /><div class="figure"><img height="367" alt="Figure 13-4" src="figs/tcp3_1304.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 13-4. FTP test summary</h4>

<p>We notified all users of the problem. In response, we received
reports that others had also experienced it, but again only when
transferring to the central system, and only when transferring via
the backbone. They had not reported it because they rarely saw it.
But the additional reports gave us some evidence that the problem did
not relate to any recent network changes.
</p>

<p>Because the problem had been duplicated on other systems, it probably
was not a configuration problem on the user's system. The
<tt class="literal">ftp</tt> failure could also be avoided if the backbone
routers and the central system did not interact. So we concentrated
our attention on those systems. We checked the routing tables and ARP
tables, and ran <tt class="literal">ping</tt> tests on the central system
and the routers. No problems were observed.
</p>

<p>Based on this preliminary analysis, the <tt class="literal">ftp</tt>
failure appeared to be a possible protocol interaction problem
between a certain brand of routers and a central computer. We made
that assessment because the transfer routinely failed when these two
brands of systems were involved, but never failed in any other
circumstance. If the router or the central system were misconfigured,
they should fail when transferring data to other hosts. If the
problem was an intermittent physical problem, it should occur
randomly, regardless of the hosts involved. Instead, this problem
occurred predictably, and only between two specific brands of
computers. Perhaps there was something incompatible in the way these
two systems implemented TCP/IP.
</p>

<p>Therefore, we used <tt class="literal">snoop</tt> to capture the TCP/IP
headers during several <tt class="literal">ftp</tt> test runs. Reviewing
the dumps showed that all transfers that failed with the
"netout" error message had an ICMP Parameter Error packet
near the end of the session, usually about 50 packets before the
final close. No successful transfer had this ICMP packet. Note that
the error did <em class="emphasis">not</em> occur in the last packet in
the data stream, as you might expect. It is common for an error to be
detected, and for the data stream to continue for some time before
the connection is actually shut down. Don't assume that an
error will always be at the end of a data stream.
</p>

<p>Here are the headers from the key packets. First, the IP header of
the packet from the backbone router that caused the central system to
send the error:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ETHER:  ----- Ether Header ----- 
ETHER:   
ETHER:  Packet 1 arrived at 16:56:36.39 
ETHER:  Packet size = 60 bytes 
ETHER:  Destination = 8:0:25:30:6:51, CDC 
ETHER:  Source      = 0:0:93:e0:a0:bf, Proteon 
ETHER:  Ethertype = 0800 (IP) 
ETHER:   
IP:   ----- IP Header ----- 
IP:    
IP:   Version = 4 
IP:   Header length = 20 bytes 
IP:   Type of service = 0x00 
IP:         xxx. .... = 0 (precedence) 
IP:         ...0 .... = normal delay 
IP:         .... 0... = normal throughput 
IP:         .... .0.. = normal reliability 
IP:   Total length = 552 bytes 
IP:   Identification = 8a22 
IP:   Flags = 0x0 
IP:         .0.. .... = may fragment 
IP:         ..0. .... = last fragment 
IP:   Fragment offset = 0 bytes 
IP:   Time to live = 57 seconds/hops 
IP:   Protocol = 6 (TCP) 
IP:   Header checksum = ffff 
IP:   Source address = 172.16.55.106, fs.wrotethebook.com 
IP:   Destination address = 172.16.51.252, bnos.wrotethebook.com 
IP:   No options IP:</pre></blockquote>

<p>And this is the ICMP Parameter Error packet sent from the central
system in response to that packet:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ETHER:  ----- Ether Header ----- 
ETHER:   
ETHER:  Packet 3 arrived at 16:56:57.90 
ETHER:  Packet size = 98 bytes

ETHER:  Source      = 8:0:25:30:6:51, CDC 
ETHER:  Ethertype = 0800 (IP) 
ETHER:

ICMP:  ----- ICMP Header ----- 
ICMP:   
ICMP:  Type = 12 (Parameter problem) 
ICMP:  Code = 0 
ICMP:  Checksum = 0d9f ICMP:  Pointer = 10</pre></blockquote>

<p>Each packet header is broken out bit by bit and mapped to the
appropriate TCP/IP header fields. From this detailed analysis of each
packet, we see that the router issued an IP Header Checksum of
0xffff, and that the central system objected to this checksum. We
know that the central system objected to the checksum because it
returned an ICMP Parameter Error with a Pointer of 10. The Parameter
Error indicates that there is something wrong with the data the
system has just received, and the Pointer identifies the specific
data that the system thinks is in error. The tenth byte of the
router's IP header is the IP Header Checksum. The data field of
the ICMP error message returns the header that it believes is in
error. When we displayed that data we noticed that when the central
system returned the header, the checksum field was
"corrected" to 0000. Clearly the central system disagreed
with the router's checksum calculation.
</p>

<p>Occasional checksum errors will occur. They can be caused by
transmission problems, and are intended to detect these types of
problems. Every protocol suite has a mechanism for recovering from
checksum errors. So how should they be handled in TCP/IP?
</p>

<p>To determine the correct protocol action in this situation, we turned
to the authoritative sources -- the RFCs. RFC 791,
<em class="emphasis">Internet Protocol</em>, provided information about
the checksum calculation, but the best source for this particular
problem was RFC 1122, <em class="emphasis">Requirements for Internet
Hosts -- Communication Layers</em>, by R. Braden. This RFC
provided two specific references that define the action to be taken.
These excerpts are from page 29 of RFC 1122:
</p>


<p>In the following, the action specified in certain cases is to
"silently discard" a received datagram. This means that
the datagram will be discarded without further processing and that
the host will not send any ICMP error message (see Section 3.2.2) as
a result....
</p>

<p>... A host MUST verify the IP header checksum on every received
datagram and silently discard every datagram that has a bad checksum.
</p>


<p>Therefore, when a system receives a packet with a bad checksum, it is
not supposed to do anything with it. The packet should be discarded,
and the system should wait for the next packet to arrive. The system
should not respond with an error message. A system cannot respond to
a bad IP header checksum because it cannot really know where the
packet came from. If the header checksum is in doubt, how do you know
if the addresses in the header are correct? And if you don't
know for sure where the packet came from, how can you respond to it?
</p>

<p>IP relies on the upper-layer protocols to recover from these
problems. If TCP is used (as it was in this case), the sending TCP
eventually notices that the recipient has never acknowledged the
segment, and it sends the segment again. If UDP is used, the sending
application is responsible for recovering from the error. In neither
case does recovery rely on an error message returned from the
recipient.
</p>

<p>Therefore, for an incorrect checksum, the central system should have
simply discarded the bad packet. The vendor was informed of this
problem and, much to their credit, they sent us a fix for the
software within two weeks. Not only that, the fix worked perfectly!
</p>

<p>Not all problems are resolved so cleanly. But the technique of
analysis is the same no matter what the <a name="INDEX-2975" /> <a name="INDEX-2976" /> <a name="INDEX-2977" />problem.
