<h2 class="sect1">2.3. Internet Routing Architecture</h2>

<p><a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "
Overview of TCP/IP"</a> described <a name="INDEX-351" /> <a name="INDEX-352" /> <a name="INDEX-353" />the evolution of the Internet
architecture over the years. Along with these architectural changes
have come changes in the way that routing information is disseminated
within the network.
</p>

<p>In the original Internet structure, there was a hierarchy of
gateways. This hierarchy reflected the fact that the Internet was
built upon the existing ARPAnet. When the Internet was created, the
ARPAnet was the backbone of the network: a central delivery medium to
carry long-distance traffic. This central system was called the
<em class="emphasis">core</em>, and the centrally managed gateways that
interconnected it were called the <em class="emphasis">core gateways</em>.
<a name="INDEX-354" />
<a name="INDEX-355" />
</p>

<p>In that hierarchical structure, routing information about all of the
networks on the Internet was passed into the core gateways. The core
gateways processed the information and then exchanged it among
themselves using the <em class="emphasis">Gateway to Gateway Protocol</em>
(GGP).<a name="INDEX-356" /><a name="INDEX-357" /> The processed routing
information was then passed back out to the external gateways. The
core gateways maintained accurate routing information for the entire
Internet.
</p>

<p>Using the hierarchical core router model to distribute routing
information has a major weakness: every route must be processed by
the core. This places a tremendous processing burden on the core, and
as the Internet grew larger the burden increased. In network-speak,
we say that this routing model does
<a name="INDEX-358" />not "scale well." For
this reason, a new model emerged.
</p>

<p>Even in the days of a single Internet core, groups of independent
networks called autonomous systems <a name="INDEX-359" />existed outside of the
<a name="INDEX-360" />core. The term <em class="emphasis">autonomous
system</em> (AS) has a formal meaning in TCP/IP routing. An
autonomous system is not merely an independent network. It is a
collection of networks and gateways with its own internal mechanism
for collecting routing information and passing it to other
independent network systems. The routing information passed to the
other network systems is called <em class="emphasis">reachability
information</em>. <a name="INDEX-361" />Reachability information simply says
which networks can be reached through that autonomous system. In the
days of a single Internet core, autonomous systems passed
reachability information into the core for processing. The
<em class="emphasis">Exterior Gateway
Protocol</em><a name="INDEX-362" /> (EGP)
<a name="INDEX-363" />was the protocol used to pass
reachability information between autonomous systems and into the
core.
</p>

<p>The new routing model is based on co-equal collections of autonomous
systems called <em class="emphasis">routing</em>
<em class="emphasis">domains</em>.<a name="INDEX-364" />
Routing domains exchange routing information with other domains using
<em class="emphasis">Border Gateway
Protocol</em><a name="INDEX-365" />
(BGP).<a name="INDEX-366" /> Each routing domain processes the
information it receives from other domains. Unlike the hierarchical
model, this model does not depend on a single core system to choose
the "best" routes. Each routing domain does this
processing for itself; therefore, this model is more expandable.
<a href="ch02_03.html#tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-3">Figure 2-3</a> represents this model with three
intersecting circles. Each circle is a routing domain. The
overlapping areas are border areas, where routing information is
shared. The domains share information but do not rely on any one
system to provide all routing information.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="288" alt="Figure 2-3" src="figs/tcp3_0203.gif" width="346" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-3. Routing domains</h4>

<p>The problem with this model is: how are "best" routes
determined in a global network if there is no central routing
authority, like the core, that is trusted to determine the
"best" routes? In the days of the NSFNET,
<a name="INDEX-367" />the <em class="emphasis">policy routing
database</em> (PRDB) <a name="INDEX-368" /> <a name="INDEX-369" />was used to determine
whether the reachability information advertised by an autonomous
system was valid. But now, even the NSFNET does not play a central
role.
</p>

<p>To fill this void, NSF created the <a name="INDEX-370" /><em class="emphasis">Routing Arbiter</em>
(RA) <a name="INDEX-371" />servers when it created the
<em class="emphasis">Network Access Points</em><a name="INDEX-372" /> (NAPs)
<a name="INDEX-373" />that provide
interconnection points for the various service provider networks. A
route arbiter is located at each NAP. The server provides access to
the <em class="emphasis">Routing Arbiter
Database</em><a name="INDEX-374" /> (RADB),
<a name="INDEX-375" />which replaced the PRDB. ISPs can
query servers to validate the reachability information advertised by
an autonomous system.
</p>

<p>The RADB is only part of the <em class="emphasis">Internet Routing
Registry</em> (IRR). <a name="INDEX-376" />As befits a distributed routing
architecture, there are multiple organizations that validate and
register routing information. Europeans were the pioneers in this.
The Reseaux IP Europeens (RIPE) Network Control Center
(NCC)<a name="INDEX-377" /> <a name="INDEX-378" /> <a name="INDEX-379" /><a name="INDEX-380" /> provides
<a name="INDEX-381" />the routing registry
for European IP networks. Big network carriers provide registries for
their customers. All of the registries share a common format based on
the RIPE-181 <a name="INDEX-382" />standard.
</p>

<p>Many ISPs do not use the route servers. Instead they depend on formal
and informal bilateral <a name="INDEX-383" />
<a name="INDEX-384" />agreements, where two ISPs get
together and decide what reachability information each will accept
from the other. They create, in effect, private routing policies.
Small ISPs have criticized the routing policies of the tier-one
providers, claiming that they limit competition. In response, most
tier-one providers have promised to make the policies public, which
should clarify the basis for the current architecture and may even
spark more changes.
</p>

<p>Creating an effective routing architecture continues to be a major
challenge for the Internet, and the routing architecture will
certainly evolve over time. No matter how it is derived, the routing
information eventually winds up in your local gateway, where it is
used by IP to make routing <a name="INDEX-385" /> <a name="INDEX-386" /> <a name="INDEX-387" />decisions.
