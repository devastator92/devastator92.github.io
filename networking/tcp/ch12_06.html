<h2 class="sect1">12.6. Encryption </h2>

<p><em class="emphasis">Encryption</em> is a
<a name="INDEX-2790" />
<a name="INDEX-2791" />technique
for limiting access to the data carried on the network. Encryption
encodes the data in a form that can be read only by systems that have
the "key" to the encoding scheme. The original text,
called the "clear text," is encrypted using an encryption
device (hardware or software) and an encryption key. This produces
encoded text, which is called the cipher. To recreate the clear text,
the cipher must be decrypted using the same type of encryption device
and an appropriate key.
</p>

<p>Largely because of spy novels and World War II movies, encryption is
one of the first things that people think of when they think of
security. However, encryption has not always been applicable to
network security. Traditionally, encrypting data for transmission
across a network required that the same encryption key, called a
<em class="emphasis">shared secret</em> or a <em class="emphasis">private
key</em><a name="INDEX-2792" />,
be used at both ends of the data exchange. Unless you controlled both
ends of the network and could ensure that the same encryption key was
available to all participants, it was difficult to use end-to-end
data encryption. For this reason, encryption was most commonly used
to exchange data where the facilities at both ends of the network
were controlled by a single authority, such as military networks,
private networks, individual systems, or when the individuals at both
ends of the communication could reach personal agreement on the
encryption technique and key. Encryption that requires prior
agreement to share a secret key is called <em class="emphasis">symmetric
encryption</em><a name="INDEX-2793" />.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Public-key encryption</em>
<a name="INDEX-2794" />
<a name="INDEX-2795" /> <a name="INDEX-2796" />is the technology that makes
encryption an important security technology for an open global
network like the Internet. For example, an e-commerce web server and
any customer's web browser can exchange encrypted data because
they both use public-key cryptography. Public-key systems encode the
clear text with a key that is widely known and publicly available,
but the cipher can only be decoded back to clear text with a secret
key. This means that Dan can look up Kristin's public key in a
trusted database and use it to encode a message to her that no one
else can read. Even though everyone on the Internet has access to the
public key, only Kristin can decrypt the message using her secret
key. This encrypted communication takes place without Kristin ever
divulging her secret key.
</p>

<p>Additionally, messages encrypted using the private key can only be
decrypted by the public key. Thus the public key can be used to
authenticate the source of a message since only the proper source
should have access to the private key. Because public-key
cryptography uses different keys for encryption and decryption, it is
called <em class="emphasis">asymmetric
encryption</em><a name="INDEX-2797" />.
</p>

<p>One problem with asymmetric encryption is that it is computationally
intensive and slow when compared to symmetric encryption. For this
reason it is used for only a small portion of the data exchange.
Public-key encryption is used for both encryption and authentication
during the initial handshake of an encrypted connection. During the
handshake, a shared secret key, protected by public-key encryption,
is exchanged by the participants. The subsequent data exchange is
encrypted with symmetric encryption using that shared key.
</p>

<p>Another problem with public-key encryption in a global network is
that it requires a universally recognized, trusted infrastructure to
distribute public keys and to ensure that the keys have not been
tampered with. The first step when Dan sent a message to Kristin was
retrieving her public key. But where did it come from? The key
probably came from one of two places: from a private exchange of
public keys or from the network with verification from a trusted
certificate authority. When the number of participants is limited,
public keys can be exchanged through private agreements in the same
manner that private keys used to be exchanged. That does not work,
however, for global network applications where there is no prior
knowledge of the participants. In that case the public key is
obtained from the network and certified by a trusted third party
called a <em class="emphasis">certificate authority</em> (CA). The CA
provides the public key in a message called a
<em class="emphasis">certificate</em> that contains the public key, the
name of the organization whose key it is, and dates when the key
became valid and when it will become invalid. This message is signed
with the private key of the CA. Thus when the certificate is verified
using the CA's public key, the recipient knows that the
certificate came from the trusted CA. CA public keys are well known
and widely distributed. For example, browser vendors provide the
public keys of many CAs with every copy of their browser software.
</p>

<p>The type of encryption used in the examples in the next section is
symmetric encryption. It requires that the same encryption technique
and the same secret key is used for both encrypting and decrypting
the message. It does not rely on public keys, digital signatures, or
a widely accepted infrastructure, but its usefulness is limited.

<h3 class="sect2">12.6.1. When Is Symmetric Encryption Useful? </h3>

<p>Before using
<a name="INDEX-2798" />
<a name="INDEX-2799" />
<a name="INDEX-2800" />encryption, decide why you want to
encrypt the data, whether the data should be protected with
encryption, and whether the data should even be stored on a networked
computer system.
</p>

<p>A few valid reasons for encrypting data are:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>To prevent casual browsers from viewing sensitive data files</p>
</li><li>
<p>To prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data</p>
</li><li>
<p>To prevent privileged users (e.g., system administrators) from
viewing private data files
</p>
</li><li>
<p>To complicate matters for intruders who attempt to search through a
system's files
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>There are several tools available for encrypting data files, many of
which are commercial packages. Two open source filesystems that
provide automatic file encryption are the Cryptographic File System
(CFS) and the Practical Privacy Disk Driver (PPDD).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-136">[136]</a> There are even a couple of file encryption
tools included with Solaris and Linux.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-136" /><p>[136]<em class="emphasis">Linux Security</em> by Ramon Hontanon (Sybex)
covers the installation, configuration, and use of both CFS and
PPDD.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Solaris includes the old Unix <tt class="literal">crypt</tt> command.
<tt class="literal">crypt</tt> is easy to use, but it has limited value.
The encryption provided by <tt class="literal">crypt</tt> is easily broken.
At best, <tt class="literal">crypt</tt> protects files from casual
browsing, nothing more.
</p>

<p>The age of <tt class="literal">crypt</tt> and the fact that other, better,
more recent symmetric encryption tools are not included with the
operating system show that there is little demand for symmetric
encryption tools. Public-key encryption is simply more flexible and
can be used for a wider range of applications. In fact, the file
encryption tool included with Linux is an asymmetric encryption tool.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.6.2. Public-Key Encryption Tools</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2801" /> <a name="INDEX-2802" /> <a name="INDEX-2803" />Public-key
encryption is the type of encryption that has the greatest customer
demand. The most popular Unix encryption tools,
<tt class="literal">ssh</tt> and SSL, are public-key tools. Even for tasks
such as encrypting files for local storage, public-key systems are
popular because they do not require users to share their private
keys.
</p>

<p>Linux systems often include the <a name="INDEX-2804" /> <a name="INDEX-2805" />GNU Privacy Guard
(<tt class="literal">gpg</tt>). <tt class="literal">gpg</tt>, like the well-known
tool PGP,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-137">[137]</a> can be
used to encrypt files or mail.</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-137" /><p>[137]<em class="emphasis">PGP: Pretty Good

<p>It also provides digital signature
services that can be used for email
authentication. In the following example, <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> is
used to encrypt and decrypt a file. We begin by creating our keys
with the <tt class="literal">--gen-key</tt> option:

public and secret key created and signed.</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">--gen-key</tt><a name="INDEX-2806" /> option asks several questions. However,
the questions are simple and the initial key generation needs to be
done only once. First <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> asks what kind of key
you want. What it is really asking is whether you want to use the
keys for digital signatures, for encryption, or for both digital
signatures and encryption. Choose (<tt class="literal">1</tt>), which is
the default. This creates both types of keys so that you're
prepared for any encryption task. Next it asks how long the key
should be; the longer the key, the more difficult it is to generate
and crack. The default is 1024 bits, which is plenty long for any
realistic <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> application. <tt class="literal">gpg</tt>
asks for your name, email address, and,
optionally, a comment. It uses this information to identify your keys
in the key databases. Finally, it asks for a passphrase that will be
used to identify you when you access your secret key.
</p>

<p><tt class="literal">gpg</tt> uses two key databases: one for secret keys
and one for public keys. <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> calls these
<a name="INDEX-2807" />databases
"key rings." The database of secret keys is
<em class="emphasis">secring.gpg</em><a name="INDEX-2808" /> and the database of public keys is
<em class="emphasis">pubring.gpg</em><a name="INDEX-2809" />. Both public and private keys are used
when we encrypt and then decrypt a file. The following example shows
the encryption process:
</p>

<p>

<img alt="Figure 12.6.2" src="figs/encryption.gif" />
</p>


<p>The <tt class="literal">cat</tt><a name="INDEX-2810" /> command shows that we have created a
simple text file named <em class="emphasis">test.txt</em> that we wish to
encrypt. It is clear what the <tt class="literal">--encrypt</tt> option on
the <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> command line is doing, but the purpose of
the <tt class="literal">--recipient</tt> argument is not as clear. The
<em class="emphasis">pubring.gpg</em> database can contain many public
keys. The <tt class="literal">--recipient</tt> argument identifies the
public key used to encrypt the file. The word "recipient"
is used because <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> is often used to encrypt mail,
and therefore the public key of the mail recipient is used. For this
same reason, it is common to identify the desired key with the
email address provided when the key was
created.
</p>

<p><tt class="literal">gpg</tt> produces a cipher file that has the same name
as the clear-text file with the addition of the file extension
<em class="emphasis">.gpg</em>. A <tt class="literal">cat</tt> of the cipher
file shows that it is not readable. After checking that the cipher
file exists, the clear-text file is deleted. It wouldn't do us
much good to create an encrypted file if the unencrypted file was
still around for everyone to read!
</p>

<p>To read the cipher file, it must be decrypted. In the following
example, the
<tt class="literal">--decrypt</tt><a name="INDEX-2811" /> option is used with the
<tt class="literal">gpg</tt> command to decrypt the
<em class="emphasis">test.txt.gpg</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">gpg  -- output test.txt  -- decrypt test.txt.gpg</b>
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Craig Hunt &lt;craig.hunt@wrotethebook.com&gt;"
1024-bit ELG-E key, ID D99991BA, created 2001-09-18 (main key ID 9BE3B5AD)
Enter passphrase: <b class="emphasis-bold">Fateful lightening</b>
$ <b class="emphasis-bold">cat test.txt</b>
This is a test file.</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">--output</tt> option tells <tt class="literal">gpg</tt>
where to write the clear text after decrypting the cipher file. In
the example we write it to <em class="emphasis">test.txt</em>. A
<tt class="literal">cat</tt> of <em class="emphasis">test.txt</em> shows that
the file is readable and that it contains the original test.
</p>

<p>These <tt class="literal">gpg</tt> examples are reminiscent of the
<tt class="literal">ssh</tt> examples seen earlier in this chapter and the
<tt class="literal">openssl</tt> examples in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "
Configuring Apache"</a>.
All of these programs have tools to generate public and private keys
that are then used for a specific purpose. <tt class="literal">gpg</tt>
secures files and email.
<tt class="literal">ssh</tt> secures terminal connections.
<tt class="literal">openssl</tt> secures web traffic. SSL, however, can be
used to secure communications for a wide variety of <a name="INDEX-2812" /> <a name="INDEX-2813" /> <a name="INDEX-2814" />applications.

<p><tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> is a <a name="INDEX-2815" /> <a name="INDEX-2816" />
<a name="INDEX-2817" />
<a name="INDEX-2818" />program that uses SSL to encrypt
traffic for daemons that do not encrypt their own traffic.
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> brings the benefit of public-key
encryption to a wide variety of network applications.
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> is included with OpenSSL and is installed
when OpenSSL is installed.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-138">[138]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-138" /><p>[138]OpenSSL is covered in
<a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11, "

<p>Like all applications that use SSL, <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> needs
a certificate to function properly. The easiest way to create the
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> certificate is to change to the SSL
certificate directory and run <tt class="literal">make</tt>, as in the
example below:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">cd /usr/share/ssl/certs</b>

<p>By default the <tt class="literal">openssl</tt> installation creates the
directory <em class="emphasis">/usr/share/ssl/certs</em> to hold
certificates, and by default <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> looks for a
certificate in that directory with the filename
<em class="emphasis">stunnel.pem</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-139">[139]</a> As with all new <tt class="literal">openssl</tt> certificates,
you're prompted for the information needed to uniquely identify
the certificate.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-139" /><p>[139]The default
certificate path can be changed on the <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt>
command line with the -<tt class="literal">p</tt> option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the certificate is created, <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> is ready
for use. POP and IMAP are excellent examples of services that can be
run inside a secure connection using <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt>. The
primary reason that POP and IMAP are run through
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> is to ensure that the user's
password cannot be stolen from a POP or IMAP session and then used by
the thief to log into the server. <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> encrypts
everything: the login and the download of mail. This also guarantees
that the contents of the mail cannot be surreptitiously read by a
snooper during the download, although from the point of view of the
system administrator, the password is really the piece of information
you want to protect.
</p>

<p>For secure POP and IMAP communication to work, both ends of the
connection must be able to tunnel the data through SSL. This is not
always the case. Some clients do not have <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt>;
some do not even have SSL. For this reason, servers usually provide
traditional POP and IMAP connections on the appropriate well-known
ports, and SSL-secured POP and IMAP on other ports. When run over
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt>, POP is called <em class="emphasis">pops</em>
and assigned TCP port 995, and IMAP is called
<em class="emphasis">imaps</em> and assigned TCP port 993.
<em class="emphasis">pops</em> and <em class="emphasis">imaps</em> are not
special protocols. They are simply service names from the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file that map to port numbers 995
and 993. The following command added to the system startup runs POP
inside an SSL tunnel on port 995:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">stunnel -d 995 -l /usr/sbin/ipop3d -- ipop3d</pre></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> can be run by
<tt class="literal">inetd</tt> using an entry in the
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> file. For example, the following
entry runs POP inside an SSL tunnel on a demand basis:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">pops stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/stunnel -l /usr/sbin/ipop3d -- ipop3d</pre></blockquote>

<p>Systems that use <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> can run
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> from the <em class="emphasis">xinetd.conf</em>
file. The following <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> entry runs
<em class="emphasis">imaps</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">service imaps
{
        socket_type             = stream
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/sbin/stunnel
        server_args             = -l /usr/sbin/imapd -- imapd
        log_on_failure          += USERID
}</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> has nothing specific to do with POP or
IMAP. It can be used to secure a wide variety of daemons. When used
to secure a daemon that is normally run by <tt class="literal">inetd</tt>
or <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt>, the <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> command
is placed in the <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> or
<em class="emphasis">xinetd.conf</em> file, as appropriate. When used to
secure a daemon that runs from a startup file, the
<tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> command is placed in that startup file.
</p>

<p>Despite the power of tools like <tt class="literal">stunnel</tt> and
<tt class="literal">ssh</tt>, encryption is not a substitute for good
computer security. Encryption can protect sensitive or personal
information from snooping, but it should never be the sole means of
protecting critical information. Encryption systems can be broken,
and encrypted data can be deleted or corrupted just like any other
data. So don't let encryption lull you into a false sense of
security. Some information is so sensitive or critical that it should
not be stored on a networked computer system, even if it is
encrypted. Encryption is only a small part of a complete security
