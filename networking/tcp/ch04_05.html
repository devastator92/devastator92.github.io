<h2 class="sect1">4.5. Other Services </h2>

<p>Three services that are used on many networks are file servers, print
servers, and mail servers. The purpose of these services and the
protocols they are built on was discussed in <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a>. In this section we investigate what
information must be passed to the users so that the client systems
can be successfully configured and how the network administrator
determines that information.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.5.1. File Servers </h3>

<p>At a <a name="INDEX-934" />
<a name="INDEX-935" />minimum, the user needs to know the
hostnames of the network file servers. Using the names and the
<tt class="literal">showmount</tt> command, the user can determine what
filesystems are being offered by the servers and who is permitted to
use those filesystems.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-40">[40]</a> Without at least the
hostname, the user would have to guess which system offered file
service.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-40" /><p>[40]See the
<tt class="literal">showmount</tt> command in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Local Network Services"</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>A better approach is to give users information that includes what
filesystems are being offered and who should use those filesystems.
For example, if the Unix manpages are made available from a central
server, the users should be informed not to install the
<tt class="literal">man</tt> pages on their local disk drives and should be
told exactly how to access the centrally supported files.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.5.2. Print Servers </h3>

<p>Whether <a name="INDEX-936" />printers are shared
using <tt class="literal">lp</tt>, <tt class="literal">lpd</tt>, or Samba, the
basic information needed to configure the print server's
clients is the same: the hostname and IP address of the print server
and the name of the printer. The printer make and model may be needed
for non-PostScript printers. Printer security may also require that
the user be given a username and password to access the printer.
</p>

<p>This is the only information needed to configure the client. However,
you probably will want to provide your users with additional
information about the features, location, and administration of
shared printers.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-5.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.5.3. Planning Your Mail System </h3>

<p>TCP/IP provides
<a name="INDEX-937" /> <a name="INDEX-938" />the tools you need to create a
reliable, flexible electronic mail system. Servers are one of the
tools that improve reliability. It is possible to create a
peer-to-peer email network in which every end system directly sends
and receives its own mail. However, relying on every system to
deliver and collect the mail requires that every system be properly
administered and consistently up and running. This isn't
practical because many small systems are offline for large portions
of the day. Most networks use servers so that only a few systems need
to be properly configured and operational for the mail to go through.
</p>

<p>The terminology that describes email servers is confusing because all
the server functions usually occur in one computer, and all the terms
are used interchangeably to refer to that system. This text
differentiates between these functions, but it is expected that you
will do all of these tasks on one Unix system running sendmail. The
terms are used in the following manner:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Mail server</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-939" />
<a name="INDEX-940" />mail
server collects incoming mail for other computers on the network. It
supports interactive logins as well as POP and IMAP so that users can
manage their mail as they see fit.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Mail relay</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A mail <a name="INDEX-941" />relay is
a host that forwards mail between internal systems and from internal
systems to remote hosts. Mail relays allow internal systems to have
simple mail configurations because only the relay host needs to have
software to handle special mail-addressing schemes and aliases.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Mail gateway</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A mail <a name="INDEX-942" />
<a name="INDEX-943" />gateway
is a system that forwards email between dissimilar systems. You
don't need a gateway to go from one Internet host to another
because both systems use SMTP. You do need a gateway to go from SMTP
to X.400 or to a proprietary mailer. In a pure TCP/IP network, this
function is not needed.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The mail server is the most important component of a reliable system
because it eliminates reliance on the user's system. A
centrally controlled, professionally operated server collects the
mail regardless of whether or not the end system is operational.
</p>

<p>The relay host also contributes to the reliability of the email
system. If mail cannot be immediately delivered by the relay host, it
is queued and processed later. An end system also queues mail, but if
it is shut down no attempts can be made to deliver queued mail until
the system is back online. The mail server and the mail relay are
operated 24 hours a day.
</p>

<p>The design of
<a name="INDEX-944" />most TCP/IP email networks is based
on the following guidelines:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Use a mail server to collect mail, and POP or IMAP to deliver the
mail to the client.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use a mail relay host to forward mail. Implement a simplified email
address scheme on the relay host.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Standardize on TCP/IP and SMTP. Users who insist on using a
proprietary email system should be responsible for obtaining and
configuring an SMTP mail gateway for that system in order to connect
to your TCP/IP email network.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Standardize on MIME for binary attachments. Avoid proprietary
attachment schemes; they just cause confusion when the users of Brand
X email cannot read attachments received from Brand Y.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For their client configurations, provide the users with the hostname
and IP address of the mail server and the mail relay. The mail server
will also require a username and password for each person.
</p>
