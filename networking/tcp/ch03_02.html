<h2 class="sect1">3.2. The Host Table</h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-495" /> <a name="INDEX-496" /><em class="emphasis">host table</em> is a
simple text file that associates IP addresses with hostnames. On most
Unix systems, the table is in the file
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em>.<a name="INDEX-497" /><a name="INDEX-498" /> Each table entry in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> contains an IP address separated by
whitespace from a list of hostnames associated with that address.
Comments begin with <tt class="literal">#</tt>.<a name="INDEX-499" />
<a name="INDEX-500" /> <a name="INDEX-501" /><a name="INDEX-502" /><a name="INDEX-503" />
</p>

<p>The host table on <em class="emphasis">rodent</em> might contain the
following entries:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># 
# Table of IP addresses and hostnames 
# 
172.16.12.2     rodent.wrotethebook.com rodent 
127.0.0.1       localhost 
172.16.12.1     crab.wrotethebook.com crab loghost 
172.16.12.4     jerboas.wrotethebook.com jerboas 
172.16.12.3     horseshoe.wrotethebook.com horseshoe 
172.16.1.2      ora.wrotethebook.com ora
172.16.6.4      linuxuser.articles.wrotethebook.com linuxuser</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first entry in the sample table is for
<em class="emphasis">rodent</em> itself. The IP address 172.16.12.2 is
associated with the hostname
<em class="emphasis">rodent.wrotethebook.com</em> and the alternate
hostname (or alias) <em class="emphasis">rodent</em>. The hostname and all
of its
<a name="INDEX-504" />
<a name="INDEX-505" />aliases
resolve to the same IP address, in this case 172.16.12.2.
</p>

<p>Aliases provide for name changes, alternate spellings, and shorter
hostnames. They also allow for "generic hostnames." Look
at the entry for 172.16.12.1. One of the aliases associated with that
address is <em class="emphasis">loghost</em>.<a name="INDEX-506" />
<a name="INDEX-507" /> <em class="emphasis">loghost</em> is a
special hostname used by Solaris in the
<em class="emphasis">syslog.conf</em><a name="INDEX-508" />
<a name="INDEX-509" />
<a name="INDEX-510" />
configuration file. Some systems preconfigure programs like
<tt class="literal">syslogd</tt> to direct their output to the host that
has a certain generic name. You can direct the output to any host you
choose by assigning it the appropriate generic name as an alias.
Other commonly used generic hostnames are
<em class="emphasis">lprhost</em>, <em class="emphasis">mailhost</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">dumphost</em>.
</p>

<p>The second entry in the sample file assigns the address 127.0.0.1 to
the hostname <em class="emphasis">localhost</em>. As we have discussed,
the network address 127.0.0.0/8 is reserved for the
<a name="INDEX-511" />
<a name="INDEX-512" />
<a name="INDEX-513" />loopback network. The host address
127.0.0.1 is a special address used to designate the loopback address
of the local host -- hence the hostname
<em class="emphasis">localhost</em>. This special addressing convention
allows the host to address itself the same way it addresses a remote
host. The loopback address simplifies software by allowing common
code to be used for communicating with local or remote processes.
This addressing convention also reduces network traffic because the
<em class="emphasis">localhost</em> address is associated with a loopback
device that loops data back to the host before it is written out to
the network.
</p>

<p>Although the host table system has been superseded by DNS, it is
still widely used for the following reasons:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Most systems have a small host table containing name and address
information about the important hosts on the local network. This
small table is used when DNS is not running, such as during the
initial system startup. Even if you use <a name="INDEX-514" />DNS, you should create a small
<em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</em> file containing entries for your
host, for <em class="emphasis">localhost</em>, and for the gateways and
servers on your local net.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sites that use NIS <a name="INDEX-515" />use <a name="INDEX-516" />the host table
as input to the NIS host database. You can use NIS in conjunction
with DNS, but even when they are used together, most NIS sites create
host tables that have an entry for every host on the local network.
<a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9, "Local Network Services"</a> explains how to use NIS with DNS.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Very small sites that are not connected to the Internet sometimes use
the host table. If there are few local hosts and the information
about those hosts rarely changes, and there is also no need to
communicate via TCP/IP with remote sites, then there is little
advantage to using DNS.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The old host table system is inadequate for <a name="INDEX-517" />the
global Internet for two reasons: inability to scale
<a name="INDEX-518" />and lack of an automated update
process. Prior to the development of DNS, an organization called the
<a name="INDEX-519" /><a name="INDEX-520" />Network Information Center (NIC)
maintained a large table of Internet hosts called the <em class="emphasis">NIC
host table</em>. Hosts included in the table were called
<em class="emphasis">registered</em> <a name="INDEX-521" /><em class="emphasis">hosts</em>, and the NIC
placed hostnames and addresses into this file for all sites on the
Internet.
</p>

<p>Even when the host table was the primary means of translating
hostnames to IP addresses, most sites registered only a limited
number of key systems. But even with limited registration, the table
grew so large that it became an inefficient way to convert hostnames
to IP addresses. There is no way that a simple table could provide
adequate service for the enormous number of hosts on today's
Internet.
</p>

<p>Another problem with the host table system is that it lacks a
technique for automatically distributing information about newly
registered hosts. Newly registered hosts can be referenced by name as
soon as a site receives the new version of the host table. However,
there is no way to guarantee that the host table is distributed to a
site, and no way to know who had a current version of the table and
who did not. This lack of guaranteed uniform distribution is a major
weakness of the host table <a name="INDEX-522" /> <a name="INDEX-523" />system.
