<h2 class="sect1">12.3. Application Security </h2>

<p>Having authentication is an important security measure. However, it
isn't the only thing you can do to improve the security of your
computer and your network. Most break-ins occur when bugs in
applications are exploited or when applications are misconfigured. In
this section we'll look at some things you can do to improve
application security.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.3.1. Remove Unnecessary Software </h3>

<p>Any software
<a name="INDEX-2708" />
<a name="INDEX-2709" />that allows an incoming connection
from a remote site has the potential of being exploited by an
intruder. Some security experts recommend you remove every daemon
from the <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em> file that you
don't absolutely need. (Configuring the
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> file and the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/xinetd.conf</em> file is discussed in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5, "Basic Configuration "</a>, with explicit examples of removing
<tt class="literal">tftp</tt> from service.)
</p>

<p>Server systems may require several daemons, but most desktop systems
require very few, if any. Removing the daemons from
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> prevents only inbound connections. It
does not prevent out-bound connections. A user can still initiate a
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt> to a remote site even after the
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt> daemon is removed from her system's
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em>. A simple approach used by some
people is to remove everything from <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em>
and then add back to the file only those daemons that you decide you
really need.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.3.2. Keep Software Updated </h3>

<p>Vendors
<a name="INDEX-2710" />
<a name="INDEX-2711" />frequently
release new versions of network software for the express purpose of
improving network security. Use the latest version of the network
software offered by your vendor. Track the security alerts, CERT
advisories, and bulletins to know what programs are particularly
important to keep updated.
</p>

<p>If you fail to keep the software on your system up to date, you open
a big security hole for intruders. Most intruders don't
discover new problems -- they exploit well-known problems. Keep
track of the known security problems so you can keep your system up
to date.
</p>

<p>Stay informed about all the latest fixes for your system. The
computer security advisories are a good way to do this. Contact your
vendor and find out what services they provide for distributing
security fixes. Make sure that the vendor knows that security is
important to you.
</p>

<p><a href="ch12_03.html#tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-2">Figure 12-2</a> shows a software update list at the Red
Hat web site. Clicking on any of the updates listed here provides a
detailed description of the problem as well as a link to the fix for
that problem.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="334" alt="Figure 12-2" src="figs/tcp3_1202.gif" width="481" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-2. Vendor-provided updates</h4>

<p>Vendor resources such as the one shown in <a href="ch12_03.html#tcp3-CHP-12-FIG-2">Figure 12-2</a> are essential for keeping software up to date.
However, you must use these resources for them to be effective.
Frequently, administrators complain that vendors do not fix problems,
and of course sometimes that is true. But a far more common problem
is that system administrators do not install the fixes that are
available. Set aside some time every month to apply the latest
updates.
</p>

<p>Software update services, such as the <a name="INDEX-2712" />Red Hat
Network, have the potential of lessening the burden of keeping
software up to date. With a software update service, the vendor is
responsible for periodically updating the system software via the
network. Whether or not these services will be a success remains to
be seen. They have the potential to improve security and reduce the
administrative burden, but many administrators fear the loss of
control that comes with giving update privileges to an outside
organization.
