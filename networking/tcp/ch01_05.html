<h2 class="sect1">1.5. Internet Layer</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-129" />The layer <a name="INDEX-130" />
<a name="INDEX-131" /><a name="INDEX-132" />above
the Network Access Layer in the protocol hierarchy is the
<em class="emphasis">Internet Layer</em>. The Internet Protocol (IP) is
<a name="INDEX-133" />the most important
protocol in this layer. The release of IP used in the current
Internet is IP version 4 (IPv4), which is defined in RFC 791. There
are more recent versions of IP. IP version 5 is an experimental
Stream Transport (ST) protocol used for real-time data delivery. IPv5
never came into operational use. IPv6 is an IP standard that provides
greatly expanded addressing capacity. Because IPv6 uses a completely
different address structure, it is not interoperable with IPv4. While
IPv6 is a standard version of IP, it is not yet widely used in
operational, commercial networks. Since our focus is on practical,
operational networks, we do not cover IPv6 in detail. In this chapter
and throughout the main body of the text, "IP" refers to
IPv4. IPv4 is the protocol you will configure on your system when you
want to exchange data with remote systems, and it is the focus of
this text.
</p>

<p>The Internet Protocol is the heart of TCP/IP. IP provides the basic
packet delivery service on which TCP/IP networks are built. All
protocols, in the layers above and below IP, use the Internet
Protocol to deliver data. All incoming and outgoing TCP/IP data flows
through IP, regardless of its final destination.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.1. Internet Protocol</h3>

<p>The Internet <a name="INDEX-134" />
<a name="INDEX-135" />
<a name="INDEX-136" />Protocol
is the building block of the Internet. Its functions include:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Defining the datagram, which is the basic unit of transmission in the
Internet
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Defining the Internet addressing scheme</p>
</li><li>
<p>Moving data between the Network Access Layer and the Transport Layer</p>
</li><li>
<p>Routing datagrams to remote hosts</p>
</li><li>
<p>Performing fragmentation and re-assembly of datagrams</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Before describing these functions in more detail, let's look at
some of IP's characteristics. First, IP is a
<em class="emphasis">connectionless protocol</em>. This means that it does
not exchange control information (called a "handshake")
<a name="INDEX-137" />to establish an
end-to-end connection before transmitting data. In contrast, a
<em class="emphasis">connection-oriented protocol</em> exchanges control
information with the remote system to verify that it is ready to
receive data before any data is sent. When the handshaking is
successful, the systems are said to have established a
<em class="emphasis">connection</em>. The Internet Protocol relies on
protocols in other layers to establish the connection if they require
connection-oriented service.
</p>

<p>IP also relies on protocols in the other layers to provide error
<a name="INDEX-138" />detection
and error <a name="INDEX-139" />recovery. The Internet Protocol is
sometimes called an <em class="emphasis">unreliable protocol</em> because
it contains no error detection and recovery code. This is not to say
that the protocol cannot be relied on -- quite the contrary. IP
can be relied upon to accurately deliver your data to the connected
network, but it doesn't check whether that data was correctly
received. Protocols in other layers of the TCP/IP architecture
provide this checking when it is required.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-5.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.1. The datagram</h3>

<p>The TCP/IP <a name="INDEX-140" />
<a name="INDEX-141" />
<a name="INDEX-142" />protocols
were built to transmit data over the ARPAnet, which was a
<em class="emphasis">packet-switching
network</em>.<a name="INDEX-143" />
<a name="INDEX-144" /> A <em class="emphasis">packet</em> is a
block of data that carries with it the information necessary to
deliver it, similar to a postal letter, which has an address written
on its envelope. A packet-switching network uses the addressing
information in the packets to switch packets from one physical
network to another, moving them toward their final destination. Each
packet travels the network independently of any other packet.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">datagram</em> is the packet format defined by the
Internet Protocol. <a href="ch01_05.html#tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-5">Figure 1-5</a> is a pictorial
representation of an IP datagram. The first five or six 32-bit words
of the datagram are control information called the
<em class="emphasis">header</em>.<a name="INDEX-145" />
By default, the header is five words long; the sixth word is
optional. Because the header's length is variable, it includes
a field called <em class="emphasis">Internet Header Length</em>
<a name="INDEX-146" /> <a name="INDEX-147" />(IHL) that indicates the
header's length in words. The header contains all the
information necessary to deliver the packet.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img height="206" alt="Figure 1-5" src="figs/tcp3_0105.gif" width="413" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 1-5. IP datagram format</h4>

<p>The Internet Protocol delivers the datagram by checking the
<em class="emphasis">Destination Address</em>
<a name="INDEX-148" />in word 5 of the header. The
Destination Address is a standard 32-bit IP address that identifies
the destination network and the specific host on that network. (The
format of IP addresses is explained in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>.)
If the Destination Address is the address of a host on the local
network, the packet is delivered directly to the destination. If the
Destination Address is not on the local network, the packet is passed
to a gateway for delivery.
<a name="INDEX-149" />
<a name="INDEX-150" /><em class="emphasis">Gateways</em>
are devices that switch packets between the different physical
networks. Deciding which gateway to use is called
<em class="emphasis">routing</em>.
<a name="INDEX-151" />IP
makes <a name="INDEX-152" />the
<a name="INDEX-153" />routing decision for each
individual packet.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-5.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.2. Routing datagrams</h3>

<p>Internet <a name="INDEX-154" />
<a name="INDEX-155" />
<a name="INDEX-156" />
<a name="INDEX-157" />
<a name="INDEX-158" />gateways
are commonly (and perhaps more accurately) referred to as
<em class="emphasis">IP routers</em> because they use Internet Protocol to
route packets between networks. In traditional TCP/IP jargon, there
are only two types of network
devices -- <em class="emphasis">gateways</em> and
<em class="emphasis">hosts</em>. Gateways forward packets between
networks, and hosts don't. However, if a host is connected to
more than one network (called a <em class="emphasis">multi-homed
host</em>),<a name="INDEX-159" />
<a name="INDEX-160" />
it can forward packets between the networks. When a multi-homed host
forwards packets, it acts just like any other gateway and is in fact
considered to be a gateway. Current data communications terminology
makes a distinction between gateways and routers,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a> but
we'll use the terms <em class="emphasis">gateway</em> and
<em class="emphasis">IP router</em> interchangeably.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-6" /><p>[6]In
current terminology, a gateway moves data between different
protocols, and a router moves data between different networks. So a
system that moves mail between TCP/IP and X.400 is a gateway, but a
traditional IP gateway is a router.</p> </blockquote>

<p><a href="ch01_05.html#tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-6">Figure 1-6</a> shows the use of gateways to forward
packets. The hosts (or <em class="emphasis">end systems</em>) process
packets through all four protocol layers, while the gateways (or
<em class="emphasis">intermediate systems</em>) process the packets only
up to the Internet Layer where the routing decisions are made.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="186" alt="Figure 1-6" src="figs/tcp3_0106.gif" width="410" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 1-6. Routing through gateways</h4>

<p>Systems can deliver packets only to other devices attached to the
same physical network. Packets from <em class="emphasis">A1</em> destined
for host <em class="emphasis">C1</em> are forwarded through gateways
<em class="emphasis">G1</em> and <em class="emphasis">G2</em>. Host
<em class="emphasis">A1</em> first delivers the packet to gateway
<em class="emphasis">G1</em>, with which it shares network
<em class="emphasis">A</em>. Gateway <em class="emphasis">G1</em> delivers the
packet to <em class="emphasis">G2</em> over network
<em class="emphasis">B</em>. Gateway <em class="emphasis">G2</em> then delivers
the packet directly to host <em class="emphasis">C1</em> because they are
both attached to network <em class="emphasis">C</em>. Host
<em class="emphasis">A1</em> has no knowledge of any gateways beyond
gateway <em class="emphasis">G1</em>. It sends packets destined for both
networks <em class="emphasis">C</em> and <em class="emphasis">B</em> to that
local gateway and then relies on that gateway to properly forward the
packets along the path to their destinations. Likewise, host
<em class="emphasis">C1</em> sends its packets to <em class="emphasis">G2</em>
to reach a host on network <em class="emphasis">A</em>, as well as any
host on network <em class="emphasis">B</em>.
</p>

<p><a href="ch01_05.html#tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-7">Figure 1-7</a> shows another view of routing. This
figure emphasizes that the underlying physical networks a datagram
travels through may be different and even incompatible. Host
<em class="emphasis">A1</em> on the token ring network routes the datagram
through gateway <em class="emphasis">G1</em> to reach host
<em class="emphasis">C1</em> on the Ethernet. Gateway
<em class="emphasis">G1</em> forwards the data through the X.25 network to
gateway <em class="emphasis">G2</em> for delivery to
<em class="emphasis">C1</em>. The datagram traverses three physically
different networks, but eventually arrives intact at
<em class="emphasis">C1</em>.

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-5.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.3. Fragmenting datagrams</h3>

<p>As a datagram <a name="INDEX-161" />
<a name="INDEX-162" />
<a name="INDEX-163" />
<a name="INDEX-164" />
<a name="INDEX-165" />is
routed through different networks, it may be necessary for the IP
module in a gateway to divide the datagram into smaller pieces. A
datagram received from one network may be too large to be transmitted
in a single packet on a different network. This condition occurs only
when a gateway interconnects dissimilar physical networks.
</p>

<p>Each type of network has a <em class="emphasis">maximum transmission
unit</em><a name="INDEX-166" />
<a name="INDEX-167" />
<a name="INDEX-168" /> (MTU), which is the
largest packet that it can transfer. If the datagram received from
one network is longer than the other network's MTU, the
datagram must be divided into smaller <em class="emphasis">fragments</em>
for transmission. This process is called
<em class="emphasis">fragmentation</em>. Think of a train delivering a
load of steel. Each railway car can carry more steel than the trucks
that will take it along the highway, so each railway car's load
is unloaded onto many different trucks. In the same way that a
railroad is physically different from a highway, an Ethernet is
physically different from an X.25 network; IP must break an
Ethernet's relatively large packets into smaller packets before
it can transmit them over an X.25 network.
<a name="INDEX-169" /> <a name="INDEX-170" />
<a name="INDEX-171" />
</p>

<p>The format of each fragment is the same as the format of any normal
datagram. Header word 2 contains information that identifies each
datagram fragment and provides information about how to re-assemble
the fragments back into the original datagram. The
<a name="INDEX-172" />Identification field identifies what
datagram the fragment belongs to, and the
<a name="INDEX-173" />Fragmentation Offset field tells what
piece of the datagram this fragment is. The <a name="INDEX-174" />Flags field has a "More
Fragments" bit that tells IP if it has assembled all of the
datagram fragments.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-5.1.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.5.1.4. Passing datagrams to the transport layer</h3>

<p>When IP receives <a name="INDEX-175" />
<a name="INDEX-176" />
<a name="INDEX-177" />
<a name="INDEX-178" />
<a name="INDEX-179" />a
datagram that is addressed to the local host, it must pass the data
portion of the datagram to the correct Transport Layer protocol. This
is done by using the <em class="emphasis">protocol number</em> from
<a name="INDEX-180" />word 3 of the datagram header. Each
Transport Layer protocol has a unique protocol number that identifies
it to IP. Protocol numbers are discussed in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>. 
</p>

<p>You can see from this short overview that IP performs many important
functions. Don't expect to fully understand datagrams,
gateways, routing, IP addresses, and all the other things that IP
does from this short description; each chapter will add more details
about these topics. So let's continue on with the other
protocol in the TCP/IP Internet Layer.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-1-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.2. Internet Control Message Protocol</h3>

<p>An <a name="INDEX-181" />
<a name="INDEX-182" />
<a name="INDEX-183" />integral part of IP is the
<em class="emphasis">Internet Control Message
Protocol</em><a name="INDEX-184" /> (ICMP) defined in RFC
792. This protocol is part of the Internet Layer and uses the IP
datagram delivery facility to send its
messages.<a name="INDEX-185" />
ICMP sends messages that perform the following control, error
reporting, and informational functions for TCP/IP:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Flow control</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-186" />When
datagrams arrive too fast for processing, the destination host or an
intermediate gateway sends an ICMP <a name="INDEX-187" /><a name="INDEX-188" />Source Quench Message back to the
sender. This tells the source to stop sending datagrams temporarily.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Detecting unreachable destinations</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a destination is unreachable, the system detecting the problem
sends a <a name="INDEX-189" />Destination Unreachable Message
<a name="INDEX-190" />to the datagram's source. If the
unreachable destination is a network or host, the message is sent by
an intermediate gateway. But if the destination is an unreachable
port, the destination host sends the message. (We discuss ports in
<a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>.)
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Redirecting routes</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A gateway sends the <a name="INDEX-191" />ICMP <a name="INDEX-192" />Redirect Message to tell a host
to use another gateway, presumably because the other gateway is a
better choice. This message can be used only when the source host is
on the same network as both gateways. To better understand this,
refer to <a href="ch01_05.html#tcp3-CHP-1-FIG-7">Figure 1-7</a>. If a host on the X.25 network
sent a datagram to <em class="emphasis">G1</em>, it would be possible for
<em class="emphasis">G1</em> to redirect that host to
<em class="emphasis">G2</em> because the host, <em class="emphasis">G1</em>,
and <em class="emphasis">G2</em> are all attached to the same network. On
the other hand, if a host on the token ring network sent a datagram
to <em class="emphasis">G1</em>, the host could not be redirected to use
<em class="emphasis">G2</em>. This is because <em class="emphasis">G2</em> is
not attached to the token ring.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Checking remote hosts</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A host <a name="INDEX-193" />can
send the ICMP <a name="INDEX-194" />Echo Message to see if a remote
system's Internet Protocol is up and operational. When a system
receives an echo message, it replies and sends the data from the
packet back to the source host. The
<tt class="literal">ping</tt><a name="INDEX-195" /> command uses this message.
