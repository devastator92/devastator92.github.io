<h2 class="sect1">7.5. Exterior Routing Protocols </h2>

<p>Exterior routing
<a name="INDEX-1495" />
<a name="INDEX-1496" />
<a name="INDEX-1497" />protocols
are used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems.
The routing information passed between autonomous systems is called
<em class="emphasis">reachability
information</em><a name="INDEX-1498" />. Reachability information is simply
information about which networks can be reached through a specific
autonomous system.
</p>

<p>RFC 1771 defines Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the leading exterior
routing protocol, and provides the following description of the
routing function of an autonomous system:
</p>


<blockquote>The classic definition of an Autonomous System is a set of routers
under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway
protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS, and using
an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other ASs.... The
administration of an AS appears to other ASs to have a single
coherent interior routing plan and presents a consistent picture of
what networks are reachable through it. From the standpoint of
exterior routing, an AS can be viewed as monolithic...
</blockquote>


<p>Moving routing information into and out of these monoliths is the
function of exterior routing protocols. Exterior routing protocols
are also called exterior gateway protocols. Don't confuse
<em class="emphasis">an</em> exterior gateway protocol with
<em class="emphasis">the</em> Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP). EGP is not
a generic term; it is a particular exterior routing protocol, and an
old one at that.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.5.1. Exterior Gateway Protocol </h3>

<p>A gateway <a name="INDEX-1499" />
<a name="INDEX-1500" />
<a name="INDEX-1501" />
<a name="INDEX-1502" />running EGP
announces that it can reach networks that are part of its autonomous
system. It does not announce that it can reach networks outside its
autonomous system. For example, the exterior gateway for our
imaginary autonomous system <em class="emphasis">book-as</em> can reach
the entire Internet through its external connection, but only one
network is contained in its autonomous system. Therefore, it would
announce only one network (172.16.0.0) if it ran EGP.
</p>

<p>Before sending routing information, the systems exchange EGP
<em class="emphasis">Hello</em> and <em class="emphasis">I-Heard-You</em>
(I-H-U) messages. These messages establish a dialogue between two EGP
gateways. Computers communicating via EGP are called <em class="emphasis">EGP
neighbors</em>, and the exchange of Hello and I-H-U messages is
called <em class="emphasis">acquiring a
neighbor</em><a name="INDEX-1503" />.
</p>

<p>Once a neighbor is acquired, routing information is requested via a
<em class="emphasis">poll</em><a name="INDEX-1504" />. The neighbor responds by sending a
packet of reachability information called an
<a name="INDEX-1505" /><em class="emphasis">update</em>. The local
system includes the routes from the update into its local routing
table. If the neighbor fails to respond to three consecutive polls,
the system assumes that the neighbor is down and removes the
neighbor's routes from its table. If the system receives a poll
from its EGP neighbor, it responds with its own update packet.
</p>

<p>Unlike the interior protocols discussed above, EGP does not attempt
to choose the "best" route. EGP updates contain
distance-vector information, but EGP does not evaluate this
information. The routing metrics from different autonomous systems
are not directly comparable. Each AS may use different criteria for
developing these values. Therefore, EGP leaves the choice of a
"best" route to someone else.
</p>

<p>When EGP was designed, the network relied upon a group of trusted
core gateways to process and distribute the routes received from all
of the autonomous systems. These core gateways were expected to have
the information necessary to choose the best external routes. EGP
<a name="INDEX-1506" />reachability
information was passed into the core gateways, where the information
was combined and passed back out to the autonomous systems.
</p>

<p>A routing structure that depends on a centrally controlled group of
gateways does not scale well and is therefore inadequate for the
rapidly growing Internet. As the number of autonomous systems and
networks connected to the Internet grew, it became difficult for the
core gateways to keep up with the expanding workload. This is one
reason why the Internet moved to a more distributed architecture that
places a share of the burden of processing routes on each autonomous
system. Another reason is that no central authority controls the
commercialized Internet. The Internet is composed of many equal
networks. In a distributed architecture, the autonomous systems
require routing protocols, both interior and exterior, that can make
intelligent routing choices. Because of this, EGP is no longer
popular.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-5.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.5.2. Border Gateway Protocol </h3>

<p><em class="emphasis">Border Gateway Protocol</em> (BGP) is
<a name="INDEX-1507" />
<a name="INDEX-1508" />
<a name="INDEX-1509" />
<a name="INDEX-1510" />the leading
exterior routing protocol of the Internet. It is based on the OSI
<em class="emphasis">InterDomain Routing
Protocol</em><a name="INDEX-1511" /> <a name="INDEX-1512" /> (IDRP). BGP supports
<em class="emphasis">policy-based routing</em>, which uses non-technical
reasons (for example, political, organizational, or security
considerations) to make routing decisions. Thus BGP enhances an
autonomous system's ability to choose between routes and to
implement routing policies without relying on a central routing
authority. This feature is important in the absence of core gateways
to perform these tasks.
</p>

<p>Routing policies are not part of the BGP protocol. Policies
<a name="INDEX-1513" />are provided externally as configuration
information. As described in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>, the
National Science Foundation provides Routing Arbiters (RAs) at the
Network Access Points (NAPs) where large Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) interconnect. The RAs can be queried for routing policy
information. Most ISPs also develop private policies based on the
bilateral agreements they have with other ISPs. BGP can be used to
implement these policies by controlling the routes it announces to
others and the routes it accepts from others. In the
<tt class="literal">gated</tt> section later in this chapter, we discuss
the <tt class="literal">import</tt> command and the
<tt class="literal">export</tt> command, which control what routes are
accepted (import) and what routes are announced (export). The network
administrator enforces the routing policy through configuring the
router.
</p>

<p>BGP is implemented on top of TCP, which provides BGP with a reliable
delivery service. BGP uses well-known TCP port 179. It acquires its
neighbors through the standard TCP three-way handshake. BGP neighbors
are called
<a name="INDEX-1514" /><em class="emphasis">peers</em>.
Once connected, BGP peers exchange <a name="INDEX-1515" />OPEN messages to negotiate session
parameters, such as the version of BGP that is to be used.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1516" />UPDATE message lists the destinations that
can be reached through a specific path and the attributes of the
path. BGP is a <em class="emphasis">path-vector protocol</em>. It is
called a path-vector protocol because it provides the entire
end-to-end path of a route in the form of a sequence of autonomous
system numbers. Having the complete AS path eliminates the
possibility of routing loops and count-to-infinity problems. A BGP
UPDATE contains a single path vector and all of the destinations
reachable through that path. Multiple UPDATE packets may be sent to
build a routing table.
</p>

<p>BGP peers send each other complete routing table updates when the
connection is first established. After that, only changes are sent.
If there are no changes, just a small (19-byte)
<a name="INDEX-1517" />KEEPALIVE message is sent to indicate that
the peer and the link are still operational. BGP is very efficient in
its use of network bandwidth and system resources.
</p>

<p>By far the most important thing to remember about exterior protocols
is that most systems never run them. Exterior protocols are required
only when an AS must exchange routing information with another AS.
ost routers within an AS run an interior protocol such as OSPF. Only
those gateways that connect the AS to another AS need to run an
exterior routing protocol. Your network is probably an independent
part of an AS run by someone else. ISPs are good examples of
autonomous systems made up of many independent networks. Unless you
provide a similar level of service, you probably don't need to
run an exterior routing protocol.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-5.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.5.3. Choosing a Routing Protocol </h3>

<p>Although there
<a name="INDEX-1518" />
<a name="INDEX-1519" />are
many routing protocols, choosing one is usually easy. Most of the
interior routing protocols mentioned above were developed to handle
the special routing problems of very large networks. Some of the
protocols have been used only by large national and regional
networks. For local area networks, RIP is still a common choice. For
larger networks, OSPF is the choice.
</p>

<p>If you must run an exterior routing protocol, the protocol that you
use is often not a matter of choice. For two autonomous systems to
exchange routing information, they must use the same exterior
protocol. If the other AS is already in operation, its administrators
have probably decided which protocol to use, and you will be expected
to conform to their choice. Most often this choice is BGP.
</p>

<p>The type of equipment affects the choice of protocols. Routers
support a wide range of protocols, though individual vendors may have
a preferred protocol. Hosts don't usually run routing protocols
at all, and most Unix systems are delivered with only RIP. Allowing
host systems to participate in dynamic routing could limit your
choices. <tt class="literal">gated</tt>, however, gives you the option to
run many different routing protocols on a Unix system. While the
performance of hardware designed specifically to be a router is
generally better, <tt class="literal">gated</tt> gives you the option of
using a Unix system as a router.
</p>

<p>In the following sections we discuss the Gateway Routing Daemon
(<tt class="literal">gated</tt>) software that combines interior and
exterior routing protocols into one software package. We look at
examples of running RIP, RIPv2, OSPF, and BGP with
<tt class="literal">gated</tt>.
