<p>In this chapter, our emphasis shifts from how TCP/IP functions to how
it is configured. While Chapters <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "
Overview of TCP/IP"</a> through
<a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a> described the TCP/IP protocols and how
they work, now we begin to explore the network configuration process.
The first step in this process is planning. Before configuring a host
to run TCP/IP, you must have certain information. At the very least,
every host must have a unique IP address and hostname. You should
also resolve the following issues before configuring a system:
<a name="INDEX-788" /></a> <a name="INDEX-789" /></a><a name="INDEX-790" /></a>
</p>


<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Default gateway address</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the <a name="INDEX-791" /></a> <a name="INDEX-792" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-793" /></a>system communicates with TCP/IP hosts
that are not on its local network, a default gateway address may be
needed. Alternatively, if a
<a name="INDEX-794" /></a>routing protocol is used on
the network, each device needs to know that protocol.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Name server addresses</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>To resolve <a name="INDEX-795" /></a> <a name="INDEX-796" /></a>hostnames into IP addresses,
each host needs to know the addresses of the domain name servers.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Domain name</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Hosts using the <a name="INDEX-797" /></a>domain name system must know
their correct domain name.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Subnet mask</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>To <a name="INDEX-798" /></a>communicate properly, each
system on a network must use the same subnet mask.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>If you're adding a system to an existing network, make sure you
find out the answers from your network administrator before putting
the system online. The network administrator is responsible for
making and communicating decisions about overall network
configuration. If you have an established TCP/IP network, you can
skip several sections in this chapter, but you may still want to read
about selecting hostnames, planning mail systems, and other topics
that affect mature networks as much as they do new networks.
</p>

<p>If you are creating a new TCP/IP network, you will have to make some
basic decisions. Will the new network connect to the Internet? If so,
how will the connection be made? How should the network number be
chosen? How do I register a domain name? How do I choose hostnames?
In the following sections, we cover the information you need to make
these decisions.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="tcp3-CHP-4-SECT-1" /></a>
<h2 class="sect1">4.1. Connected and Non-Connected Networks </h2>

<p>First, you <a name="INDEX-799" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-800" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-801" /></a>must
decide whether your new network will be fully connected to the
Internet. A <em class="emphasis">connected network</em> is directly
attached to the Internet and is fully accessible to other networks on
the Internet. A <em class="emphasis">non-connected network</em> is not
directly attached to the Internet, and its access to Internet
networks is limited. An example of a non-connected network is a
TCP/IP network that attaches to the outside world via a network
address translation (NAT) <a name="INDEX-802" /></a>box or a proxy
server.<a name="INDEX-803" /></a> <a name="INDEX-804" /></a> Users on the non-connected network
can access remote Internet hosts, but remote users cannot directly
access hosts on the non-connected network. Because non-connected
networks do not provide services to the outside world, they are also
known as <a name="INDEX-805" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-806" /></a><em class="emphasis">private
networks</em>.
</p>

<p>Private networks that interconnect the various parts of an
organization are often called <em class="emphasis">enterprise
networks</em>.<a name="INDEX-807" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-808" /></a>
When those private networks use the information services applications
that are built on top of TCP/IP, particularly web servers and
browsers, to distribute internal information, those networks are
called <em class="emphasis">intranets</em>.
<a name="INDEX-809" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-810" /></a>
</p>

<p>There are a few basic reasons why many sites do not fully connect to
the Internet. One reason is
<a name="INDEX-811" /></a>security. Connecting to any
network gives more people access to your system. Connecting to a
global network with millions of users is enough to scare any security
expert. There is no doubt about it: connecting to the Internet
increases the security
<a name="INDEX-812" /></a>risks
for your network. <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12, "Network Security "</a> covers some techniques
for reducing this risk.
</p>

<p>Cost is another consideration. Many
<a name="INDEX-813" /></a>organizations do not see
sufficient value in a full Internet connection for every desktop. For
some organizations, low use or limited requirements, such as needing
only email access, make the cost of connecting the entire network to
the Internet exceed the benefit. For others, the primary reason for
an Internet connection is to provide information about their
products. It is not necessary to connect the entire enterprise
network to the Internet to do this. It is often sufficient to connect
a single web server to the local Internet Service Provider (ISP) or
to work with a web hosting company to provide information to your
customers.
</p>

<p>Other organizations consider an Internet connection an essential
requirement. Educational and research institutions depend on the
Internet as a source of information, and many companies use it as a
means of delivering service and support to their customers.
</p>

<p>You may have both types of networks: a non-connected enterprise
network sitting behind a security firewall, and a small connected
network that provides services to your external customers and proxy
service for your internal users.
</p>

<p>Unless you have carefully determined what your needs are and what an
Internet connection will cost, you cannot know whether connecting
your entire network to the Internet is right for your organization.
Your local ISPs can give you the various cost and performance
alternatives. Ask them about services as well as prices. Some ISPs
specialize in providing low-cost service to home users. They
emphasize price. However, if you are connecting a full network to the
Internet, you may want an ISP that can provide network addresses,
name service, web hosting, and other features that your network might
need.
