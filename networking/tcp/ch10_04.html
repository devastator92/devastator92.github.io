<h2 class="sect1">10.4. The sendmail.cf File </h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2112" />
<a name="INDEX-2113" />
<a name="INDEX-2114" />sendmail
configuration file is <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-113">[113]</a> It contains most of
the sendmail configuration, including the information required to
route mail between the user mail programs and the mail delivery
programs. The <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file has three main
functions:
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-113" /><p>[113]The default location for the configuration file prior to
sendmail 8.11 was the <em class="emphasis">/etc</em> directory. Now the
default is <em class="emphasis">/etc/mail,</em> but the file is often
placed in other directories, such as
<em class="emphasis">/usr/lib</em>.</p> </blockquote>

</li></ul>
<p>Several commands are necessary to perform all of these functions.
acro definitions and option commands define the environment. Rewrite
rules rewrite email addresses. Mailer definitions define the
instructions necessary to deliver the mail. The terse syntax of these
commands makes most system administrators reluctant to read a
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file, let alone write one!
Fortunately, you can avoid writing your own
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file, as we'll see next.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-10-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.4.1. Locating a Sample sendmail.cf File </h3>

<p>There is never
<a name="INDEX-2115" />
<a name="INDEX-2116" />
<a name="INDEX-2117" />any good
reason to write a <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file from scratch.
Sample configuration files are delivered with most systems'
software. Some system administrators use the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> configuration file that comes with
the system and make small modifications to it to handle site-specific
configuration requirements. We cover this approach to sendmail
configuration later in this chapter.
</p>

<p>Most system administrators prefer to use the <tt class="literal">m4</tt>
source files to build a <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file.
Building the configuration with <tt class="literal">m4</tt> is recommended
by the sendmail developers and is the easiest way to build and
maintain a configuration. Some systems, however, do not ship with the
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> source files, and even when
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> source files come with a system, they are
adequate only if used with the sendmail executable that comes with
that system. If you update sendmail, use the <tt class="literal">m4</tt>
source files that are compatible with the updated version of
sendmail. If you want to use <tt class="literal">m4</tt> or the latest
version of sendmail, download the
<a name="INDEX-2118" />sendmail source code
distribution <a name="INDEX-2119" />from
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">http://www.sendmail.org</a>. See <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a> for an example of installing the sendmail
distribution.
</p>

<p>The sendmail <em class="emphasis">cf/cf</em><a name="INDEX-2120" />
directory contains several sample configuration files. Several of
these are generic files preconfigured for different operating
systems. The <em class="emphasis">cf/cf</em> directory in the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.8.11.3</em> directory contains generic
configurations for BSD, Solaris, SunOS, HP Unix, Ultrix, OSF1, and
Next Step. The directory also contains a few prototype files designed
to be easily modified and used for other operating systems. We will
modify the <em class="emphasis">tcpproto.mc</em> file, which is for
systems that have direct TCP/IP network connections and no direct
UUCP connections, to run on our Linux system.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-10-SECT-4.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">10.4.1.1. Building a sendmail.cf with m4 macros </h3>

<p>The prototype <a name="INDEX-2121" /> <a name="INDEX-2122" /> <a name="INDEX-2123" /> <a name="INDEX-2124" />files that
come with the sendmail <tt class="literal">tar</tt> are not "ready to
run." They must be edited and then processed by the
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> macro processor to produce the actual
configuration files. For example, the
<em class="emphasis">tcpproto.mc</em><a name="INDEX-2125" /> file contains the following macros:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">divert(0)dnl 
VERSIONID(`$Id: ch10_04.htm,v 1.3 2002/04/16 22:37:26 ellie Exp $') 
OSTYPE(`unknown') 
FEATURE(`nouucp', `reject') 
AILER(`local')
AILER(`smtp')</pre></blockquote>

<p>These macros are not sendmail commands; they are input for the
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> macro processor. The few lines shown above are
the active lines in the <em class="emphasis">tcpproto.mc</em> file. They
are preceded by a section of comments, not shown here, that is
discarded by <tt class="literal">m4</tt> because it follows a
<tt class="literal">divert(-1)</tt> command, which diverts the output to
the "bit bucket." This section of the file begins with a
<tt class="literal">divert(0)</tt> command, which means these commands
should be processed and that the results should be directed to
standard output.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">dnl</tt><a name="INDEX-2126" /> command that appears at the end of the
<tt class="literal">divert(0)</tt> line is used to prevent unwanted lines
from appearing in the output file. <tt class="literal">dnl</tt> deletes
everything up to the next newline. It affects the appearance, but not
the function, of the output file. <tt class="literal">dnl</tt> can appear
at the end of any macro command. It can also be used at the beginning
of a line. When it is, the line is treated as a comment.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2127" />VERSIONID macro is used for version
control. Usually the value passed in the macro call is a version
number in RCS (Release Control System) or SCCS (Source Code Control
System) format. This macro is optional, and we can just ignore it.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2128" />OSTYPE macro defines operating
system-specific information for the configuration. The
<em class="emphasis">cf/ostype</em> directory contains almost 50
predefined operating system macro files. The OSTYPE macro is required
and the value passed in the OSTYPE macro call must match the name of
one of the files in the directory. Examples of values are
<tt class="literal">bsd4.4</tt>, <tt class="literal">solaris8</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">linux</tt>.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2129" />FEATURE macro defines optional
features to be included in the <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file.
The <tt class="literal">nouucp</tt> feature in the example shown says that
UUCP addresses are not used on this system. The argument
<tt class="literal">reject</tt> says that local addresses that use the UUCP
bang syntax (i.e., contain an <tt class="literal">!</tt> in the local part)
will be rejected. Recall that in the previous section we identified
<em class="emphasis">tcpproto.mc</em> as the prototype file for systems
that have no UUCP connections. Another prototype file would have
different FEATURE values.
</p>

<p>The prototype file ends with the mailer macros. These must be the
last macros in the input file. The example shown above specifies the
local mailer macro and the SMTP mailer macro.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-2130" />MAILER(local) macro includes the
<em class="emphasis">local</em> mailer that delivers local mail between
users of the system and the <em class="emphasis">prog</em> mailer that
sends mail files to programs running on the system. All the generic
macro configuration files include the MAILER(local) macro because the
<em class="emphasis">local</em> and <em class="emphasis">prog</em> mailers
provide essential local mail delivery services.
</p>

<p>The MAILER(smtp) macro includes all of the mailers needed to send
SMTP mail over a TCP/IP network. The mailers
<a name="INDEX-2131" />included
in this set are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2132" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">smtp</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mailer can handle traditional 7-bit ASCII SMTP mail. It is
outmoded because most modern mail networks handle a variety of data
types.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2133" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">esmtp</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mailer supports Extended SMTP (ESMTP). It understands the ESMTP
protocol extensions and it can deal with the complex message bodies
and enhanced data types of MIME mail. This is the default mailer used
for SMTP mail.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2134" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">smtp8</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mailer sends 8-bit data to the remote server, even if the remote
server does not indicate that it can support 8-bit data. Normally, a
server that supports 8-bit data also supports ESMTP and thus can
advertise its support for 8-bit data in the response to the EHLO
command. (See <a href="ch03_01.html">Chapter 3, "Network Services"</a> for a description of the
SMTP protocol and the EHLO command.) It is possible, however, to have
a connection to a remote server that can support 8-bit data but does
not support ESMTP. In that rare circumstance, this mailer is
available for use.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2135" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">dsmtp</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mailer allows the destination system to retrieve mail queued on
the server. Normally, the source system sends mail to the destination
in what might be called a "push" model, where the source
pushes mail out to the destination. On demand, SMTP allows the
destination to "pull" mail down from the mail server when
it is ready to receive the mail. This mailer implements the ETRN
command that permits on-demand delivery. (The ETRN protocol command
is described in RFC 1985.)
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2136" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">relay</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mailer is used when SMTP mail must be relayed through another
mail server. Several different mail relay hosts can be defined.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Every server that is connected to or communicates with the Internet
uses the MAILER(smtp) set of mailers, and most systems on isolated
networks use these mailers because they use TCP/IP on their
enterprise network. Despite the fact that the vast majority of
sendmail systems require these mailers, installing them is not the
default. To support SMTP mail, <a name="INDEX-2137" />you must have the MAILER(smtp) macro in
your configuration, which is why it is included in the prototype
file.
</p>

<p>In addition to these two important sets of mailers, there are nine
other sets of mailers available with the MAILER command, all of which
are covered in <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a>. Most of them are of very
little interest for an average configuration. The two sets of mailers
included in the <em class="emphasis">tcpproto.mc</em> configuration are
the only ones that most administrators ever use.
</p>

<p>To create a sample <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> from the
<em class="emphasis">tcpproto.mc</em> prototype file, copy the prototype
file to a work file. Edit the work file to change the OSTYPE line
from <tt class="literal">unknown</tt> to the correct value for your
operating system, e.g., <tt class="literal">solaris8</tt> or
<tt class="literal">linux</tt>. In the example we use
<tt class="literal">sed</tt> to change <tt class="literal">unknown</tt> to
<tt class="literal">linux</tt>. We store the result in a file we call
<em class="emphasis">linux.mc</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">sed 's/unknown/linux/' &lt; tcpproto.mc &gt; linux.mc</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>Then enter the <tt class="literal">m4</tt> command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">m4 ../m4/cf.m4 linux.mc &gt; sendmail.cf</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file output by the
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> command is in the correct format to be read by
the sendmail program. With the exception of how UUCP addresses are
handled, the output file produced above is similar to the sample
<em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> configuration file delivered
with the sendmail distribution.
</p>

<p>OSTYPE is not the only thing in the macro file that can be modified
to create a custom configuration. There are a large number of
configuration
<a name="INDEX-2138" />options, all of which are explained in
<a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a>. As an example we modify a few options
to create a custom configuration that converts
<em class="emphasis">user@host</em> email addresses originating from our
computer into <em class="emphasis">firstname.lastname@domain</em>. To do
this, we create two new configuration files: a macro file with
specific values for the domain that we name
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com.m4,</em> and a modified macro
control file, <em class="emphasis">linux.mc</em>, that calls the new
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com.m4</em> file.
</p>

<p>We create the new macro file <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com.m4</em>
and place it in the <em class="emphasis">cf/domain</em> directory. The new
file contains the following:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">cat domain/wrotethebook.com.m4</b>
ASQUERADE_AS(wrotethebook.com) 
FEATURE(masquerade_envelope)
FEATURE(genericstable)</pre></blockquote>

<p>These lines say that we want to hide the real hostname and display
the name <em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com</em> in its place in
outbound email addresses. Also, we want to do this on
"envelope" addresses as well as message header addresses.
The first two lines handle the conversion of the host part of the
outbound email address. The last line says that we will use the
generic <a name="INDEX-2139" />
<a name="INDEX-2140" />address conversion
<a name="INDEX-2141" />database, which converts login
usernames to any value we wish to convert the user part of the
outbound address. We must build the database by creating a text file
with the data we want and processing that file through the
<tt class="literal">makemap</tt> command that comes with sendmail.
</p>

<p>The format of the database can be very simple: </p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">dan Dan.Scribner 
tyler Tyler.McCafferty 
pat Pat.Stover 
willy Bill.Wright
craig Craig.Hunt</pre></blockquote>

<p>Each line in the file has two fields: the first field is the key,
which is the login name, and the second field is the user's
real first and last names separated by a dot. Fields are separated by
spaces. Using this database, a query for <tt class="literal">dan</tt> will
return the value <tt class="literal">Dan.Scribner</tt>. A small database
such as this one can be easily built by hand. On a system with a
large number of existing user accounts, you may want to automate this
process by extracting the user's login name and first and last
names from the <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> file. The
<tt class="literal">gcos</tt> field of the <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>
file often contains the user's real name.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-114">[114]</a> </p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-114" /><p>[114]See
<a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a> for a sample script that builds the
<em class="emphasis">realnames</em> database from
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Once the data is
in a text file, convert it to a database with the
<tt class="literal">makemap</tt> command. The
<tt class="literal">makemap</tt><a name="INDEX-2142" /> command is included in the sendmail
distribution. The syntax of the <tt class="literal">makemap</tt> command
is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><b class="emphasis-bold">makemap</b> <em class="replaceable">type name</em></pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">makemap</tt> reads the standard input and writes the
database out to a file it creates using the value provided by
<em class="replaceable">name</em> as the filename. The
<em class="replaceable">type</em> field identifies the database type.
The most commonly supported database types for sendmail are
<tt class="literal">dbm</tt>, <tt class="literal">btree</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">hash</tt>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-115">[115]</a> All
of these types can be made with the <tt class="literal">makemap</tt>
command.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-115" /><p>[115]On Solaris systems, NIS maps
and NIS+ tables are built with standard commands that come with the
operating system. The syntax for using those maps within sendmail is
different (see <a href="ch10_06.html#tcp3-CHP-10-TABLE-3">Table 10-3</a>). </p> </blockquote>

<p>Assume that the data shown above has been put in a file named
<em class="emphasis">realnames</em>. The following command converts that
file to a database:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">makemap hash genericstable &lt; realnames</b></pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">makemap</tt> reads the text file and produces a
database file called
<em class="emphasis">genericstable</em><a name="INDEX-2143" />. The database maps login names to
real names, e.g., the key <tt class="literal">willy</tt> returns the value
<tt class="literal">Bill.Wright</tt>.
</p>

<p>Now that we have created the database, we create a new sendmail
configuration file to use it. All of the <tt class="literal">m4</tt> macros
related to using the database are in the
<em class="emphasis">wrotethebook.com.m4</em> file. We need to include
that file in the configuration. To do that, add a
<tt class="literal">DOMAIN(wrotethebook.com)</tt> line to the macro control
file (<em class="emphasis">linux.mc</em>) and then process the
<em class="emphasis">linux.mc</em> through <tt class="literal">m4</tt>. The
following <tt class="literal">grep</tt> command shows what the macros in
the file look like after the change:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">grep '^[A-Z]' linux.mc</b> 
VERSIONID(`$Id: ch10_04.htm,v 1.3 2002/04/16 22:37:26 ellie Exp $') 
OSTYPE(`linux') 
DOMAIN(`wrotethebook.com') 
FEATURE(`nouucp', `reject') 
AILER(`local') 
AILER(`smtp')
<b class="emphasis-bold"># m4 ../m4/cf.m4 linux.mc &gt; sendmail.cf</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>Use a prototype <em class="emphasis">mc</em> file as the starting point of
your configuration if you install sendmail from the
<tt class="literal">tar</tt> file. To use the latest version of sendmail
you must build a compatible <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file
using the <tt class="literal">m4</tt> macros. Don't attempt to use an
old <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file with a new version of
sendmail; you'll just cause yourself grief. As you can see from
the sample above, <tt class="literal">m4</tt> configuration files are very
short and can be constructed from only a few macros. Use
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> to build a fresh configuration every time you
upgrade sendmail.
</p>

<p>Conversely, you should not use a <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em>
file created from the prototype files found in the sendmail
distribution with an old version of sendmail. Features in these files
require that you run a compatible version of sendmail, which means it
is necessary to recompile sendmail to use the new configuration
file.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-116">[116]</a> This is not
something every system administrator will choose to do, because some
systems don't have the correct libraries; others don't
even have a C compiler! If you choose not to recompile sendmail, you
can use the sample <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file provided
with your system as a starting point. However, if you have major
changes planned for your configuration, it is probably easier to
recompile sendmail and build a new configuration with
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> than it is to make major changes directly to
the <em class="filename">sendmail.cf. </em>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-116" /><p>[116]See <a href="appe_01.html">Appendix E, "A sendmail Reference"</a> for
information about compiling sendmail.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In the next part of this chapter, we use one of the sample
<em class="filename">sendmail.cf</em> files provided with Linux. The
specific file we start with is <em class="filename">generic-linux.cf</em>
found in the <em class="filename">cf/cf</em> directory of the sendmail
distribution. All of the things we discuss in the remainder of the
chapter apply equally well to <em class="filename">sendmail.cf</em> files
that are produced by <tt class="literal">m4</tt>. The structure of a
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file, the commands that it contains,
and the tools used to debug it are <a name="INDEX-2144" /> <a name="INDEX-2145" /> <a name="INDEX-2146" /> <a name="INDEX-2147" />universal.

<h3 class="sect2">10.4.2. General sendmail.cf Structure </h3>

<p>Most <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> files
<a name="INDEX-2148" />
<a name="INDEX-2149" />
<a name="INDEX-2150" />have more
or less the same structure because most are built from the standard
<tt class="literal">m4</tt> macros. Therefore, the files provided with your
system probably are similar to the ones used in our examples. Some
systems use a different structure, but the functions of the sections
described here will be found somewhere in most
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> files.
</p>

<p>The Linux file, <em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em>, is our example
of <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file structure. The section
labels from the sample file are used here to provide an overview of
the <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> structure. These sections will
be described in greater detail when we modify a sample configuration.
The sections are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2151" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Local Information</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the information that is specific to the individual host. In
the <em class="emphasis">generic-linux.cf</em> file, Local Information
defines the hostname, the names of any mail relay hosts, and the mail
domain. It also contains the name that sendmail uses to identify
itself when it returns error messages, the message that sendmail
displays during an SMTP login, and the version number of the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file. (Increase the version number
each time you modify the configuration.) This section is usually
customized during configuration.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Options</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the sendmail options. This section usually requires no
modifications.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2152" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Message Precedence</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the various message precedence values used by sendmail. This
section is not modified.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2153" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Trusted Users</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the users who are trusted to override the sender address when
they are sending mail. This section is not modified. Adding users to
this list is a potential security problem.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2154" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Format of Headers</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the format of the headers that sendmail inserts into mail.
This section is not modified.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2155" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Rewriting Rules</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the rules used to rewrite mail addresses. Rewriting Rules
contains the general rules called by sendmail or other rewrite rules.
This section is not modified during the initial sendmail
configuration. Rewrite rules are usually modified only to correct a
problem or to add a new service.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2156" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Mailer Definitions</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the instructions used by sendmail to invoke the mail delivery
programs. The specific rewrite rules associated with each individual
mailer are also defined in this section. The mailer definitions are
usually not modified. However, the rewrite rules associated with the
mailers are sometimes modified to correct a problem or to add a new
service.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The section labels in the sample file delivered with your system may
be different from these. However, the structure of your sample file
is probably similar to the structure discussed above in these ways:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The information that is customized for each host is probably at the
beginning of the file.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Similar types of commands (option commands, header commands, etc.)
are usually grouped together.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The bulk of the file consists of rewrite rules.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The last part of the file probably contains mailer definitions
intermixed with the rewrite rules that are associated with the
individual mailers.
</p>

<p>Look at the comments in your <em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> file.
Sometimes these comments provide valuable insight into the file
structure and the things that are necessary to configure a system.
</p>

<p>It's important to realize how little of
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> needs to be modified for a typical
system. If you pick the right sample file to work from, you may need
to modify only a few lines in the first section. From this
perspective, sendmail configuration appears to be a trivial task. So
why are system administrators intimidated by it? It is largely
because of the difficult syntax of the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</em> configuration language.
