<h2 class="sect1">9.2. Sharing Unix Printers </h2>

<p>Unix uses NFS to <a name="INDEX-1911" />
<a name="INDEX-1912" />share
files; it uses two different tools, the <em class="emphasis">Line Printer
Daemon</em> (<tt class="literal">lpd</tt>) and the <em class="emphasis">Line
Printer</em> (<tt class="literal">lp</tt>) printer service, to
provide printer services for local and remote users.
<tt class="literal">lpd</tt> is used on BSD systems and most Linux systems.
<tt class="literal">lp</tt> is used on System V systems, including Solaris
8. In the following sections we discuss both tools.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.1. Line Printer Daemon </h3>

<p><tt class="literal">lpd</tt> manages the <a name="INDEX-1913" />
<a name="INDEX-1914" />
<a name="INDEX-1915" />printer spool area and
the print queues. <tt class="literal">lpd</tt> is started at boot time from
a startup script. It is generally included in the startup of Linux
and BSD systems by default, so you might not need to add it to your
startup script. For example, it is started by the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/init.d/lpd</em> script on a Red Hat Linux
system.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.2.1.1. The printcap file </h3>

<p>When <tt class="literal">lpd</tt> <a name="INDEX-1916" />
<a name="INDEX-1917" /> <a name="INDEX-1918" /> <a name="INDEX-1919" />starts, it reads the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/printcap</em> file to find out about the
printers available for its use. The <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>
file defines the printers and their characteristics. Configuring
<a name="INDEX-1920" />a <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file is
the scariest part of setting up a Unix print server. (Don't
worry. As we'll see later with the Solaris
<tt class="literal">admintool</tt>, most systems provide a GUI tool for
configuring printers.) The <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file scares
system administrators because the parser that reads the file is very
finicky, and the syntax of the parameters in the file is terse and
arcane. Most parser problems can be avoided by following these rules:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Start each entry with a printer name that begins in the first column.
No white-space should precede the first printer name. Multiple
printer names can be used if they are separated by pipe characters
(|). One entry must have the printer name <em class="emphasis">lp</em>. If
you have more than one printer on the server, assign
<em class="emphasis">lp</em> to the "default" printer.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Continue printer entries across multiple lines by escaping the
newline character at the end of the line with a backslash (\) and
beginning the following line with a tab. Take care that no blank
space comes after the backslash. The character after the backslash
must be the newline character.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Every field, other than the printer name, begins and ends with a
colon (:). The character before the backslash on a continued line is
a colon and the first character after the tab on the continuation
line is a colon.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Begin comments with a sharp sign (#).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The configuration parameters used in a <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>
file describe the characteristics of the printer. These
characteristics are called "capabilities" in the
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> documentation, but really they are the
printer characteristics that <tt class="literal">lpd</tt> needs to know in
order to communicate with the printer. Parameters are identified by
names that are two characters long and are usually assigned a value.
The syntax of the parameters varies slightly depending on the type of
value they are assigned. Parameters
<a name="INDEX-1921" />come in three different flavors:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Boolean</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>All <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> Boolean <a name="INDEX-1922" />values default to
"false." Specifying a Boolean enables its function.
Booleans are specified simply by entering the two-character parameter
name in the file. For example, <tt class="literal">:rs:</tt> enables
security for remote users.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Numeric</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some parameters <a name="INDEX-1923" />are assigned numeric values. For example,
<tt class="literal">:br#9600:</tt> sets the baud rate for a serial printer.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">String</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some parameters <a name="INDEX-1924" />use string values. For example,
<tt class="literal">:rp=laser:</tt> defines the name of a remote printer.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>A glance at the manpage shows that there are many
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> parameters. Thankfully, you'll
never need to use most of them. Most printer definitions are fairly
simple, and most <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> files are small.
</p>

<p>Print servers usually have only one or two directly attached
printers; any other printers defined in <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>
are probably remote printers. Most, if not all, of the printers
defined in a client's <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> are remote
printers.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># 
# Remote LaserWriter 
# 
lw:\ 
    :lf=/var/adm/lpd-errs:\ 
    :lp=:rm=horseshoe:rp=lw:\
    :sd=/var/spool/lpd-lw:</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">lw</em> printer in this sample
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file is a remote printer. The
<tt class="literal">lf</tt> parameter points to the log file used to log
status and error messages. The remote machine to which the printer is
attached is defined by the <tt class="literal">:rm=horseshoe:</tt>
parameter, and the name of the remote printer on that machine is
defined by the <tt class="literal">:rp=lw:</tt> parameter. Multiple
printers can use the same log file. The final parameter,
<tt class="literal">sd</tt>, defines the spool directory. Each printer has
its own unique spool directory. Defining the remote printer in the
client's <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file is all that is
needed to configure an LPD client.
</p>

<p>Writing a <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> from scratch is unnecessary.
At most, you will need to tweak the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>
configuration for your own special needs. All modern Unix systems
have printer configuration tools that will build the basic
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> for you. The <a name="INDEX-1925" />
<a name="INDEX-1926" />
<a name="INDEX-1927" />Red Hat
<tt class="literal">printconf-gui</tt> tool is an example.
</p>

<p>Launch the printer configuration tool on a Red Hat 7.2 system running
the Gnome desktop by selecting Printer Configuration from the System
menu. When the <tt class="literal">printconf-gui</tt> window opens, click
the New button to add a printer to the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>
file. The New button launches a printer configuration wizard. Use the
first page of the wizard to define the printer name and the queue
type. Enter the printer name, for example <em class="emphasis">lw</em>, in
the Queue Name box. Then select the Queue Type. Red Hat 7.2 offers
five choices:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Local Printer</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this type to define a directly attached printer. When Local
Printer is selected, the wizard asks you to select the printer port
to which the printer is attached. The default is
<em class="emphasis">/dev/lp0</em>. 
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Unix Printer</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this type to define a printer located on a remote server that is
accessed via the LPD protocol. When Unix Printer is selected, the
wizard asks for the name of the remote server and the name of the
printer on the remote server.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-1928" /><dt><i>Windows Printer </i></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-1929" />Use this type to define a remote
printer that is accessed via the SMB protocol. When Windows Printer
is selected, the wizard asks for the IP address of the remote server,
the SMB workgroup, and the name of the remote printer, which it calls
a <em class="emphasis">share name</em>. The wizard also allows a username
and password to be input in case they are required for access to the
printer. Printer sharing through SMB is is covered in detail later in
this chapter.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Novell Printer</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this type to define a remote printer accessed via the NetWare
protocols. When Novell Printer is selected, the wizard asks for the
name of the server and the printer on that server. A username and
password can also be entered if they are required for printer access.
To communicate with a Novell printer you must have the NetWare
protocols installed on your system.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>JetDirect Printer</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this type to define a network-attached printer that uses the
JetDirect protocol. Primarily, this protocol is used on HP printers
that contain a built-in Ethernet interface and that connect directly
to the Ethernet cable without going through a server. When JetDirect
is selected, the wizard asks for the IP address of the printer and
gives you a chance to enter a port number in case the printer is not
configured to use the standard JetDirect port.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Finally, the wizard presents you with a selection of hundreds of
printer drivers. Most Unix systems use standard PostScript printers.
Linux systems, however, are built on commodity PC hardware. PCs use a
hodgepodge of different printers. The wizard lets you select the
correct driver for your printer by selecting the printer make and
then the printer model. Once you select the drive, the configuration
is finished and the new printer is installed.
</p>

<p>The Red Hat tool is just an example. Future versions of Red Hat will
have a newer tool, and other Unix systems have their own tools. The
point is not the details of the tool, but the fact that the
<em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file is not usually written by hand. It
is created <a name="INDEX-1930" />by a <a name="INDEX-1931" /> <a name="INDEX-1932" /> <a name="INDEX-1933" /> <a name="INDEX-1934" />configuration tool.
</p>

</div>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-2.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">9.2.1.2. Using LPD </h3>

<p>Once the <a name="INDEX-1935" /> <a name="INDEX-1936" />
<a name="INDEX-1937" />printer is
configured, print jobs are sent to the line printer daemon using the
<em class="emphasis">Line Printer Remote</em> (<tt class="literal">lpr</tt>)
program. The <tt class="literal">lpr</tt> program creates a control file
and sends it and the print file to <tt class="literal">lpd</tt>. There are
many possible <tt class="literal">lpr</tt> command-line arguments, but in
general the command simply identifies the printer and the file to be
printed, as in:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">lpr -Plj ch09</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>This command sends a file called <em class="emphasis">ch09</em> to a
printer called <em class="emphasis">lj</em>. The printer can be local or
remote. It doesn't matter as long as the printer is defined in
the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em> file and therefore known to
<tt class="literal">lpd</tt>.
</p>

<p>The client software provides commands to allow the user to check the
status of the print job. <a href="ch09_02.html#tcp3-CHP-9-TABLE-2">Table 9-2</a> lists these
commands, their syntax, and their meaning.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-TABLE-2" /><h4 class="objtitle">Table 9-2. Line printer commands </h4><table border="1">

<p>In this syntax, <em class="replaceable">printer</em> is the name of the
printer as defined in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/printcap</em> file,
<em class="replaceable">user</em> is the username of the owner of a
print job, and <em class="replaceable">job</em> is the job number
associated with the print job while it is waiting in the queue. The
keyword <tt class="literal">all</tt> can be used in place of a printer name
in any <tt class="literal">lpc</tt> command to refer to all printers.
</p>

<p>While <tt class="literal">lpc</tt> is primarily for the system
administrator, the <tt class="literal">status</tt> and
<tt class="literal">start</tt> commands can be used by anyone. All the
commands shown in <a href="ch09_02.html#tcp3-CHP-9-TABLE-2">Table 9-2</a> are available to
users.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">lpq</tt><a name="INDEX-1938" /> command displays a list of
<a name="INDEX-1939" />jobs
queued for a printer. Command-line arguments permit the user to
select which printer queue is displayed and to limit the display from
that queue to a specific user's jobs or even to a specific job.
Here's an example of displaying the queue for the printer
<em class="emphasis">lp</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">lpq -Plp</b>
Printer: lp@crab 'Canon'
 Queue: 4 printable jobs
 Server: pid 1459 active
 Unspooler: pid 1460 active
 Status: waiting for subserver to exit at 14:17:47.120
 Rank   Owner/ID             Class Job Files                 Size Time
active alana@crab+458          A   458 /usr/share/printconf 18043 14:16:53

3      james@crab+479          A   479 /usr/share/printconf 18259 14:17:43
4      daniel@crab+481         A   481 /usr/share/printconf 18043 14:17:46 </pre></blockquote>

<p>A queued print job can be removed by the owner of the job with the
<tt class="literal">lprm</tt><a name="INDEX-1940" /> command. Assume that
<em class="emphasis">daniel</em> wants to remove print job number 481. He
enters the following command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">lprm -Plp 481</b>
Printer lp@crab:
  checking perms 'daniel@crab+481'
  dequeued 'daniel@crab+481' </pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">lpd</tt> and <tt class="literal">lpr</tt> were among the
first commands created for Unix to exploit the power of TCP/IP
networking. Managing printers is primarily a system administration
task. Only those aspects of <tt class="literal">lpd</tt> related to remote
printing are covered here.
</p>

</div>
</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.2. Line Printer Service </h3>

<p>The Line Printer (LP) print <a name="INDEX-1941" /> <a name="INDEX-1942" /> <a name="INDEX-1943" />
<a name="INDEX-1944" />service is used by most System V Unix
systems. LP offers the same type of service as LPD.
</p>

<p>Traditionally on System V Unix systems, the LP configuration files
are located in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/lp</em> directory. These
files perform the same basic function that the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/printcap</em> file does for LPD. However, the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/lp</em><a name="INDEX-1945" /> files are not directly edited by the
system administrator. The files are created and modified using the
System V <tt class="literal">lpadmin</tt> and <tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt>
commands.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">lpadmin</tt><a name="INDEX-1946" /> command adds local printers to the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/lp/printers</em> directory, which makes the
printers available to LP. The basic syntax of adding a new printer is
simple. The -<tt class="literal">p</tt> switch defines the local name of
the printer. The -<tt class="literal">p</tt> switch is used with either the
-<tt class="literal">v</tt> switch that defines the interface for a local
printer or the -<tt class="literal">s</tt> switch that defines the server
and printer name for a remote printer. For example, the following
command adds a local printer named <em class="emphasis">lp</em> connected
to the parallel printer port <em class="emphasis">/dev/lp1</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">lpadmin -plp -v /dev/lp1</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>This command adds a printer locally known as
<em class="emphasis">laser</em> that is the <em class="emphasis">lj</em>
printer on the remote server <em class="emphasis">crab</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">lpadmin -llaser -s crab!lj</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The specific characteristics of a printer added by
<tt class="literal">lpadmin</tt> are controlled by the
<em class="emphasis">terminfo</em><a name="INDEX-1947" /> file. <em class="emphasis">terminfo</em> is a
file that is almost identical to the <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>
file. Like <em class="emphasis">printcap</em>, it has a great many
possible parameters. For more information on
<em class="emphasis">terminfo,</em> see the manpage.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt><a name="INDEX-1948" /> command manages printer access on
<a name="INDEX-1949" />System V systems. By default,
most System V systems share all local printers. Remote printer access
settings are defined in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/lp/Systems</em><a name="INDEX-1950" /> file, which comes preconfigured with the
following entry:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">+:x:-:s5:-:n:10:-:-:Allow all connections</pre></blockquote>

<p>As the comment at its end makes clear, this entry grants all remote
systems access to the local printers. The first field defines the
name of the host being granted access. When a plus sign (+) is used
in this field, it means all hosts.
</p>

<p>The fields in an <em class="emphasis">/etc/lp/Systems</em> entry are
separated by colons (:). The field containing an <tt class="literal">x</tt>
and all of the fields containing a dash (<tt class="literal">-</tt>) can be
ignored. These fields are unused.
</p>

<p>The fourth field identifies the type of operating system used on the
remote client. It contains either <tt class="literal">s5</tt> for System V
computers that use LP to print jobs, or <tt class="literal">bsd</tt> for
BSD systems that use LPD.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">n</tt> in the sixth field indicates that this
"connection" should never be timed out and removed from
the system. A timeout period in minutes could be entered in this
field, but this is not usually done. Keep the connection available as
long as the local server is up. The <tt class="literal">10</tt> is a
related value. It indicates that if a connection to a remote system
fails, it should be retried after 10 minutes. This is a good value:
it is long enough to give the remote system a chance to restart after
a crash. Both <tt class="literal">n</tt> and <tt class="literal">10</tt> are the
defaults and don't usually need to be changed.
</p>

<p>Don't directly edit the <em class="emphasis">/etc/lp/Systems</em>
file. Modify it with the <tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt> command. To
remove a system from the <em class="emphasis">Systems</em> file, use
<tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt> with the <tt class="literal">-r</tt>
<em class="replaceable">hostname</em> command-line argument,
where <em class="replaceable">hostname</em> is the value in the first
field of the entry you wish to delete. For example, to remove the
plus sign (+) entry from the default
<em class="emphasis">/etc/lp/Systems</em> file, type:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">lpsystem -r +</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>To add an entry to the <em class="emphasis">Systems</em> file, use the
<tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt> command without the <tt class="literal">-r</tt>
option. For example, to add a BSD system named
<em class="emphasis">clock</em>, enter:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">lpsystem -t bsd -y "Linux PC in room 820" clock</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The command adds the following entry to the
<em class="emphasis">Systems</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">clock:x:-:bsd:-:n:10:-:-:Linux PC in room 820</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">-t</tt> command-line option defines the operating
system type. The <tt class="literal">-y</tt> option defines the comment;
<em class="emphasis">clock</em> is, of course, the hostname. We accepted
the default values for the timeout and the retry intervals. These
could have been modified from the command line using the <tt class="literal">-T</tt>
<em class="replaceable">timeout</em> and the <tt class="literal">-R</tt>
<em class="replaceable">retry</em> options. See the manpage
for <tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt> for more information.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">lpadmin</tt> and <tt class="literal">lpsystem</tt>
commands are found on most System V systems, including Solaris.
Solaris 8, however, does not rely solely on these commands and the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/lp</em> directory to configure LP. On a
<a name="INDEX-1951" />Solaris system, printers are
configured through the <em class="emphasis">/etc/printers.conf</em> file.
The <tt class="literal">lpadmin</tt> command will add new printers to the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/printers.conf</em> file, but printers are
usually configured through the Printer Manager window of the
<tt class="literal">admintool</tt>. <a href="ch09_02.html#tcp3-CHP-9-FIG-1">Figure 9-1</a> shows the
Printer Manager window.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="195" alt="Figure 9-1" src="figs/tcp3_0901.gif" width="448" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-1. Printer Manager</h4>

<p>Clients select Add, then Access to Printer from the Edit menu, and
enter the name of the remote printer and its server in the window
that appears. Servers share printers simply by selecting Add, then
LocalPrinter in the same menu and configuring a
local printer.
</p>

<p>All Unix systems provide some technique for sharing printers. The
network administrator's task is to ensure that the printers are
accessible via the network and that they are properly secured.
