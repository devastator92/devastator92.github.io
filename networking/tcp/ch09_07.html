<h2 class="sect1">9.7. Post Office Servers </h2>

<p>In this section we configure a system to act as a post office server.
A <em class="emphasis">post office server</em>, or <em class="emphasis">mailbox
server</em>, is a computer that holds mail for a client
computer until the client is ready to download it for the mail
reader. This service is essential to support mobile users and small
systems that are frequently offline and thus not able to receive mail
in real time. We look at two techniques for creating a post office
server: Post Office Protocol (POP), which is the original protocol
for this purpose, and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), which
is a popular alternative. We start with POP.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.7.1. POP Server </h3>

<p>A Unix <a name="INDEX-2078" /> <a name="INDEX-2079" />
<a name="INDEX-2080" />
<a name="INDEX-2081" />host turns into a Post Office Protocol
server when it runs a POP daemon. Check your system's
documentation to see if a POP daemon is included in the system
software. If it isn't clear from the documentation, check the
<em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> or <em class="emphasis">xinetd.conf</em>
file, or try the simple <tt class="literal">telnet</tt> test from <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4, "Getting Started"</a>. If the server responds to the
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt> test, not only is the daemon available on
your system, it is installed and ready to run.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">telnet localhost 110</b> 
Trying 127.0.0.1 ... 
Connected to localhost. 
Escape character is ' ]'. 
+OK POP3 crab Server (Version 1.004) ready 
<b class="emphasis-bold">quit</b> 
+OK POP3 crab Server (Version 1.001) shutdown
Connection closed by foreign host.</pre></blockquote>

<p>This example is from a system that comes with POP3 ready to run. The
Red Hat Linux system includes POP3, although it must be enabled in
the <em class="emphasis">/etc/xinetd.d/pop3</em> file before it can be
used. The Solaris system, on the other hand, does not ship with POP2
or POP3. Don't worry if your system doesn't include this
software. POP3 software is available from several sites on the
Internet where it is stored in both the
<em class="emphasis">popper17.tar</em> and the
<em class="emphasis">pop3d.tar</em> files. I have used them both, and both
work fine.
</p>

<p>If you don't have POP3 on your system, download the source
code. Extract it using the Unix <tt class="literal">tar</tt> command.
<em class="emphasis">pop3d.tar</em> creates a directory called
<em class="emphasis">pop3d</em> under the current directory, but
<em class="emphasis">popper17.tar</em> does not. If you decide to use
<tt class="literal">popper</tt>, create a new directory before extracting
it with <tt class="literal">tar</tt>. Edit the Makefile to configure it for
your system and do a <tt class="literal">make</tt> to compile the POP3
daemon. If it compiles without errors, install the daemon in a system
directory.
</p>

<p>On a Solaris system, POP3 is started by the Internet daemon,
<tt class="literal">inetd</tt>. Start POP3 from <tt class="literal">inetd</tt> by
placing the following in the <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">pop3   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/pop3d              pop3d</pre></blockquote>

<p>This entry assumes that you are using <tt class="literal">pop3d</tt>, that
you placed the executable in the <em class="emphasis">/usr/sbin</em>
directory, and that the port for this daemon is identified in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file by the name
<tt class="literal">pop3</tt>. If these things aren't true, adjust
the entry accordingly.
</p>

<p>Make sure that POP3 is actually defined in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em>. If it isn't, add the
following line to that file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">pop3         110/tcp              # Post Office Version 3</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once the lines are added to the <em class="emphasis">services</em> file
and the <em class="emphasis">inetd.conf</em> file, send a SIGHUP to
<tt class="literal">inetd</tt> to force it to read the new configuration,
as in this example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">ps -ef | grep inetd</b> 
  root  109  1  0   Jun 09 ?   0:01 /usr/sbin/inetd -s
# <b class="emphasis-bold">kill -HUP 109</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>Now that POP3 is installed, rerun the test using
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt> <tt class="literal">localhost</tt>
<tt class="literal">pop3</tt>. If the POP3 daemon answers, you're in
business. All users who have a valid user account on the system are
now able to download mail via POP3 or read the mail directly on the
server.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-9-SECT-7.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.7.2. IMAP Server </h3>

<p><em class="emphasis">Internet Message Access Protocol</em> (IMAP) is
<a name="INDEX-2082" /> <a name="INDEX-2083" />
<a name="INDEX-2084" />
<a name="INDEX-2085" />an alternative to POP. It provides the
same basic service as POP and adds features to support
<em class="emphasis">mailbox synchronization</em>, which is the ability to
read mail on a client or directly on the server while keeping the
mailboxes on both systems completely up to date. On an average POP
server, the entire contents of the mailbox are moved to the client
and either deleted from the server or retained as if never read.
Deletion of individual messages on the client is not reflected on the
server because all the messages are treated as a single unit that is
either deleted or retained after the initial transfer of data to the
client. IMAP provides the ability to manipulate individual messages
on either the client or the server and to have those changes
reflected in the mailboxes of both systems.
</p>

<p>IMAP is not a new protocol; it is about as old as POP3. There have
been four distinct versions: IMAP, IMAP2, IMAP3, and the current
version, IMAP4, which is defined in RFC 2060. IMAP is popular because
of the importance of email as a means of communicating, even when
people are out of the office, and the need for a mailbox that can be
read and maintained from anywhere.
</p>

<p>Solaris 8 does not include IMAP. IMAP binaries for Solaris are
available from <a href="http://sunfreeware.com/">http://sunfreeware.com</a>. IMAP source code can
be obtained via anonymous FTP from
<a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/">ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu</a>. Download
<em class="emphasis">/mail/imap.tar.Z</em> from
<a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/">ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu</a> as a binary image.
Uncompress and untar the file. This creates a directory containing
the source code and Makefile needed to build IMAP.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-108">[108]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-108" /><p>[108]The name of the directory tells you the current release level
of the software. At this writing, it is
<em class="emphasis">imap-2001</em>.</p> </blockquote> 

<p>Read the Makefile
carefully. It supports many versions of Unix. If you find yours
listed, use the three-character operating system type listed there.
For a Solaris system using the <tt class="literal">gcc</tt> compiler,
enter:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">make gso</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>If it compiles without error, as it does on our Solaris system, it
produces three daemons: <tt class="literal">ipop2d</tt>,
<tt class="literal">ipop3d</tt>, and <tt class="literal">imapd</tt>. We are
familiar with installing POP3. The new one is
<tt class="literal">imapd</tt>. Install it in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">imap      143/tcp       # IMAP version 4</pre></blockquote>

<p>Also add it to <em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">imap  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/imapd  imapd</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now basic IMAP service is available to every user with an account on
the server.
</p>

<p>A nice feature of the University of Washington package is that it
provides implementations of POP2 and POP3 as well as IMAP. This is
important because many email clients run POP3. The IMAP server can be
accessed only by an IMAP client. Installing POP3 along with IMAP
gives you the chance to support the full range of clients.
</p>

<p>Most Linux systems include IMAP, so compiling the source code is not
a requirement. Simply make sure that the service is listed in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file and available through
<tt class="literal">inetd</tt> or <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt>. On Red Hat
Linux 7, the <em class="emphasis">/etc/xinetd.d/imap</em> file is disabled
by default and must be enabled to allow clients access to the
service.
</p>

<p>POP and IMAP are important components of a mail service. However,
there is a great deal more to configuring a complete email system, as
we will see in the next chapter.
