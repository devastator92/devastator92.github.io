<h2 class="sect1">7.4. Interior Routing Protocols </h2>

<p>Routing protocols
<a name="INDEX-1417" />
<a name="INDEX-1418" />
<a name="INDEX-1419" />are
divided into two general groups: <em class="emphasis">interior</em> and
<em class="emphasis">exterior</em> protocols. An interior protocol is a
routing protocol used inside -- interior to -- an independent
network system. In TCP/IP terminology, these independent network
systems are called autonomous systems.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-74">[74]</a> Within an autonomous system (AS), routing information is
exchanged using an interior protocol chosen by the autonomous
system's administration.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-74" /><p>[74]Autonomous
systems are described in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All interior routing protocols perform the same basic functions. They
determine the "best" route to each destination and
distribute routing information among the systems on a network. How
they perform these functions (in particular, how they decide which
routes are best) is what makes routing protocols different from each
other. There are several interior protocols:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The <em class="emphasis">Routing Information
Protocol</em><a name="INDEX-1420" /> (RIP)
is the interior protocol most commonly used on Unix systems. RIP is
included as part of the Unix software delivered with most systems. It
is adequate for local area networks and is simple to configure. RIP
selects the route with the lowest "hop count"
(<em class="emphasis">metric</em>) as the best route. The RIP hop count
represents the number of gateways through which data must pass to
reach its destination. RIP assumes the best route is the one that
uses the fewest gateways. This approach to route choice is called a
<em class="emphasis">distance-vector
algorithm</em><a name="INDEX-1421" /><a name="INDEX-1422" />.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Hello</em><a name="INDEX-1423" /> is a protocol that uses delay as the
deciding factor when choosing the best route.
<em class="emphasis">Delay</em> is the length of time it takes a datagram
to make the round trip between its source and destination. A Hello
packet contains a timestamp indicating when it was sent. When the
packet arrives at its destination, the receiving system subtracts the
timestamp from the current time to estimate how long it took the
packet to arrive. Hello is not widely used. It was the interior
protocol of the original 56 Kbps NSFNET backbone and has had very
little use otherwise.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Intermediate System to Intermediate
System</em><a name="INDEX-1424" /><a name="INDEX-1425" /> (IS-IS) is an interior routing
protocol from the OSI protocol suite. It is a <em class="emphasis">Shortest Path
First</em> (SPF) <em class="emphasis">link-state</em> protocol. It
was the interior routing protocol used on the T1 NSFNET backbone, and
it is still used by some large service providers.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Open Shortest Path First</em><a name="INDEX-1426" /> (OSPF) is
another link-state protocol developed for TCP/IP. It is suitable for
very large networks and provides several advantages over RIP.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Of these protocols, we will discuss RIP and OSPF in detail. OSPF is
widely used on routers. RIP is widely used on Unix systems. We will
start the discussion with RIP.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.4.1. Routing Information Protocol </h3>

<p>As delivered
<a name="INDEX-1427" />
<a name="INDEX-1428" />
<a name="INDEX-1429" />
<a name="INDEX-1430" />with many Unix systems, Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) is run by the routing daemon
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> (pronounced "route"
"d"). When
<tt class="literal">routed</tt><a name="INDEX-1431" /> starts, it issues a request for routing
updates and then listens for responses to its request. When a system
configured to supply RIP information hears the request, it responds
with an update packet based on the information in its routing table.
The update packet contains the destination addresses from the routing
table and the routing metric associated with each destination. Update
packets are issued in response to requests as well as periodically to
keep routing information accurate.
</p>

<p>To build the routing <a name="INDEX-1432" />table, <tt class="literal">routed</tt> uses
the information in the update packets. If the routing update contains
a route to a destination that does not exist in the local routing
table, the new route is added. If the update describes a route whose
destination is already in the local table, the new route is used only
if it is a better route. As noted previously, RIP considers a route
with a lower "<a name="INDEX-1433" />
<a name="INDEX-1434" />hop
count" to be a better route. In RIP terminology, the hop count
is called the <em class="emphasis">cost</em> of the route or the routing
<em class="emphasis">metric</em>. We saw earlier that the routing metric
in the local routing table can be manually controlled using the
metric argument of the <tt class="literal">route</tt> command. To select
the best route, RIP must first determine the cost of the route. The
cost of a route is determined by adding the cost of reaching the
gateway that sent the update to the metric contained in the RIP
update packet. If the total cost is less than the cost of the current
route, the new route is used.
</p>

<p>RIP also deletes <a name="INDEX-1435" />routes from the routing table. It
accomplishes this in two ways. First, if the gateway to a destination
says the cost of the route is greater than 15, the route is deleted.
Second, RIP assumes that a gateway that doesn't send updates is
dead. All routes through a gateway are deleted if no updates are
received from that gateway for a specified time period. In general,
RIP issues <a name="INDEX-1436" />routing updates every 30 seconds. In many
implementations, if a gateway does not issue routing updates for 180
seconds, all routes through that gateway are deleted from the routing
table.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-4.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">7.4.1.1. Running RIP with routed </h3>

<p>To run RIP using <a name="INDEX-1437" /> <a name="INDEX-1438" /> <a name="INDEX-1439" />
<a name="INDEX-1440" />the <a name="INDEX-1441" />routing
daemon (<tt class="literal">routed</tt>),<a href="#FOOTNOTE-75">[75]</a> enter the following command:
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-75" /><p>[75]On some systems
the routing daemon is <tt class="literal">in.routed</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <b class="emphasis-bold">routed</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">routed</tt> statement is often used without any
command-line arguments, but you may want to use the
<tt class="literal">-q</tt> option. The
<tt class="literal">-q</tt><a name="INDEX-1442" /> option prevents
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> from advertising routes. It just listens to
the routes advertised by other systems. If your computer is not a
gateway, you should probably use the <tt class="literal">-q</tt> option.
</p>

<p>In the section on static routing, we did not need to comment out the
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> statement found in the
<em class="emphasis">inetinit</em> startup file because Solaris runs
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> only if the system has two network
interfaces or if the <em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> file is
found. If your Unix system starts <tt class="literal">routed</tt>
unconditionally, no action is required to run RIP; just boot your
system and RIP will run. Otherwise, you need to make sure the
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> command is in your startup and the
conditions required by your system are met. The easiest way to get
<a name="INDEX-1443" />Solaris to run
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> is to create a
<em class="emphasis">gateways</em><a name="INDEX-1444" />
<a name="INDEX-1445" />file -- even an empty one will do.
</p>

<p><tt class="literal">routed</tt> reads <em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> at
startup and adds its information to the routing table.
<tt class="literal">routed</tt> can build a functioning routing table
simply by using the RIP updates received from the RIP suppliers.
However, it is sometimes useful to supplement this information with,
for example, an initial default route or information about a gateway
that does not announce its routes. The
<em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> file stores this additional
routing information.
</p>

<p>The most common use of the <em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> file is
to define an active default route, so we'll use that as an
example. This one example is sufficient because all entries in the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> file have the same basic format.
The following entry specifies <em class="emphasis">crab</em> as the
default gateway:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">net 0.0.0.0 gateway 172.16.12.1 metric 1 active</pre></blockquote>

<p>The entry starts with the keyword <a name="INDEX-1446" /><tt class="literal">net</tt>. All
entries start with either the keyword <tt class="literal">net</tt> or the
keyword <tt class="literal">host</tt> to indicate whether the address that
follows is a network address or a host address. The destination
address 0.0.0.0 is the address used for the default route. In the
<tt class="literal">route</tt> command we used the keyword
<tt class="literal">default</tt> to indicate this route, but in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> the default route is indicated by
network address 0.0.0.0.
</p>

<p>Next is the keyword <tt class="literal">gateway</tt> followed by the
gateway's IP address. In this case it is the address of
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> (172.16.12.1).
</p>

<p>Then comes the keyword <a name="INDEX-1447" /><tt class="literal">metric</tt> followed by a
numeric metric value. The metric is the cost of the route. The metric
was almost meaningless when used with static routing, but now that we
are running RIP, the metric is used to make routing decisions. The
RIP metric represents the number of gateways through which data must
pass to reach its final destination. But as we saw with
<tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt>, the metric is really an arbitrary value
used by the administrator to prefer one route over another. (The
system administrator is free to assign any metric value.) However, it
is useful to vary the metric only if you have more than one route to
the same destination. With only one gateway to the Internet, the
correct metric to use for <em class="emphasis">crab</em> is 1.
</p>

<p>All <em class="emphasis">/etc/gateways</em> entries end with either the
keyword <tt class="literal">passive</tt><a name="INDEX-1448" /> or the keyword
<tt class="literal">active</tt><a name="INDEX-1449" />. "Passive" means the
gateway listed in the entry is not required to provide RIP updates.
Use <tt class="literal">passive</tt> to prevent RIP from deleting the route
if no updates are expected from the gateway. A passive route is
placed in the routing table and kept there as long as the system is
up. In effect, it becomes a permanent static route.
</p>

<p>The keyword <tt class="literal">active</tt>, on the other hand, creates a
route that can be updated by RIP. An active gateway is expected to
supply routing information and will be removed from the routing table
if, over a period of time, it does not provide routing updates.
Active routes are used to "prime the pump" during the RIP
startup phase, with the expectation that the routes will be updated
by RIP when the protocol is up and running.
</p>

<p>Our sample entry ends with the keyword <tt class="literal">active</tt>,
which means that this default route will be deleted if no routing
updates are received from <em class="emphasis">crab</em>. Default routes
are convenient; this is especially true when you use static routing.
But when you use dynamic routing, default routes should be used with
caution, especially if you have multiple gateways that can reach the
same destination. A passive default route prevents the routing
protocol from dynamically updating the route to reflect changing
network conditions. Use an active default route that can be updated
by the routing protocol.
</p>

<p>RIP is easy to implement and simple to configure. Perfect! Well, not
quite. <a name="INDEX-1450" />RIP
has three serious shortcomings:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Limited network diameter</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The longest RIP route is 15 hops. A RIP router cannot maintain a
complete routing table for a network that has destinations more than
15 hops away. The hop count cannot be increased because of the second
shortcoming.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Slow convergence</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Deleting a bad <a name="INDEX-1451" />route sometimes requires
the exchange of multiple routing update packets until the
route's cost reaches 16. This is <a name="INDEX-1452" />called
"counting to infinity" because RIP keeps incrementing the
route's cost until it becomes greater than the largest valid
RIP metric. (In this case, 16 is infinity.) Additionally, RIP may
wait 180 seconds before deleting the invalid routes. In
network-speak, we say that these conditions delay the
"convergence of routing," i.e., it takes a long time for
the routing table to reflect the current state of the network.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Classful routing</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>RIP interprets <a name="INDEX-1453" />
<a name="INDEX-1454" />all
addresses using the class rules described in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>. For RIP, all addresses are class A, B, or C,
which makes RIP incompatible with the current practice of
interpreting an address based on the address bit mask.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Nothing can be done to change the limited network diameter. A small
metric is essential to reduce the impact of counting to infinity.
However, limited network size is the least important of RIP's
shortcomings. The real work of improving RIP concentrates on the
other two problems, slow convergence and classful routing.
</p>

<p>Features have been added to RIP to address slow convergence. Before
discussing them we must understand how the
"counting-to-infinity" problem occurs. <a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a> illustrates a network where a
counting-to-infinity problem might happen.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="250" alt="Figure 7-2" src="figs/tcp3_0702.gif" width="384" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 7-2. Sample network</h4>

<p><a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a> shows that <em class="emphasis">crab</em>
reaches subnet 3 through <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> and then
through <em class="emphasis">ora</em>. Subnet 3 is two hops away from
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> and one hop away from
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>. Therefore
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> advertises a cost of 1 for subnet 3
and <em class="emphasis">crab</em> advertises a cost of 2, and traffic
continues to be routed through <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>. That
is, until something goes wrong. If <em class="emphasis">ora</em> crashes,
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> waits for an update from
<em class="emphasis">ora</em> for 180 seconds. While waiting,
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> continues to send updates to
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> that keep the route to subnet 3 in
<em class="emphasis">crab</em>'s routing table. When
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>'s timer finally expires, it
removes all routes through <em class="emphasis">ora</em> from its routing
table, including the route to subnet 3. It then receives an update
from <em class="emphasis">crab</em> advertising that
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> is two hops away from subnet 3.
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> installs this route and announces that
it is three hops away from subnet 3. <em class="emphasis">crab</em>
receives this update, installs the route, and announces that it is
four hops away from subnet 3. Things continue on in this manner until
the cost of the route to subnet 3 reaches 16 in both routing tables.
If the update interval is 30 seconds, this could take a long time!
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Split horizon</em> and <em class="emphasis">poison
reverse</em> are two features that attempt to avoid counting to
infinity. Here's how:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Split horizon</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>With this feature, a
<a name="INDEX-1455" /> <a name="INDEX-1456" />router
does not advertise routes on the link from which those routes were
obtained. This would solve the count-to-infinity problem described
above. Using the split horizon rule, <em class="emphasis">crab</em> would
not announce the route to subnet 3 on subnet 12 because it learned
that route from the updates it received from
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> on subnet 12. While this feature works
for the previous example described, it does not work for all
count-to-infinity configurations. (More on this later.)
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Poison reverse</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This feature <a name="INDEX-1457" /> <a name="INDEX-1458" />is an enhancement of split horizon. It
uses the same idea: "Don't advertise routes on the link
from which those routes were obtained." But it adds a positive
action to that essentially negative rule. Poison reverse says that a
router should advertise an infinite distance for routes on this link.
With poison reverse, <em class="emphasis">crab</em> would advertise subnet
3 with a cost of 16 to all systems on subnet 12. The cost of 16 means
that subnet 3 cannot be reached through <em class="emphasis">crab</em>.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Split horizon and poison reverse solve the problem described above.
But what happens if <em class="emphasis">crab</em> crashes? Refer to <a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a>. With split horizon,
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> and <em class="emphasis">smith</em> do not
advertise to <em class="emphasis">crab</em> the route to subnet 12 because
they learned the route from <em class="emphasis">crab</em>. They do,
however, advertise the route to subnet 12 to each other. When
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> goes down, <em class="emphasis">aulds</em> and
<em class="emphasis">smith</em> perform their own count to infinity before
they remove the route to subnet 12. Triggered updates address this
problem.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Triggered</em>
<a name="INDEX-1459" /> <a name="INDEX-1460" /><em class="emphasis">updates</em> are a big
improvement. Instead of waiting the normal 30-second update interval,
a triggered update is sent immediately. Therefore, when an upstream
router crashes or a local link goes down, the router sends the
changes to its neighbors immediately after it updates its local
routing table. Without triggered updates, counting to infinity can
take almost eight minutes! With triggered updates, neighbors are
informed in a few seconds. Triggered updates also use network
bandwidth efficiently. They don't include the full routing
table; they include only the routes that have changed.
</p>

<p>Triggered updates take positive action to eliminate bad routes. Using
triggered updates, a router advertises the routes deleted from its
routing table with an infinite cost to force downstream routers to
also remove them. Again, look at <a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a>. If
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> crashes, <em class="emphasis">smith</em> and
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> wait 180 seconds and remove the routes to
subnets 1, 3, and 12 from their routing tables. They then send each
other triggered updates with a metric of 16 for subnets 1, 3, and 12.
Thus they tell each other that they cannot reach these networks and
no count to infinity occurs. Split horizon, poison reverse, and
triggered updates go a long way toward eliminating counting to
infinity.
</p>

<p>It is the final shortcoming -- the fact that RIP is incompatible
with CIDR supernets and variable-length subnets -- that caused the
RIP protocol to be moved to "historical" status in 1996.
RIP is not compatible with current and future plans for the TCP/IP
protocol stack. A new version of RIP had to be created to address
this final <a name="INDEX-1461" /> <a name="INDEX-1462" /> <a name="INDEX-1463" /> <a name="INDEX-1464" />problem. 
</p>

</div>
</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.4.2. RIP Version 2 </h3>

<p>RIP version 2 (RIP-2),
<a name="INDEX-1465" />
<a name="INDEX-1466" />
<a name="INDEX-1467" />defined
in RFC 2453, is a new version of RIP. It is not a completely new
protocol; it simply defines extensions to the RIP packet format.
RIP-2 adds a network mask and a next-hop address to the destination
address and metric found in the original RIP packet.
</p>

<p>The network mask frees the RIP-2 router from the limitation of
interpreting addresses based on outdated address class rules. The
mask is applied to the destination address to determine how the
address should be interpreted. Using the mask, RIP-2 routers support
variable-length subnets and CIDR supernets.
</p>

<p>The next-hop address is the IP address of the gateway that handles
the route. If the address is 0.0.0.0, the source of the update packet
is the gateway for the route. The next-hop route permits a RIP-2
supplier to provide routing information about gateways that do not
speak RIP-2. Its function is similar to an ICMP Redirect, pointing to
the best gateway for a route and eliminating extra routing hops.
</p>

<p>RIP-2 adds other new features to RIP. It transmits updates via the
multicast address 224.0.0.9 to reduce the load on systems that are
not capable of processing a RIP-2 packet. RIP-2 also introduces a
packet authentication scheme to reduce the possibility of accepting
erroneous updates from misconfigured systems.
</p>

<p>Despite these changes, RIP-2 is compatible with RIP. The original RIP
specification allowed for future versions of RIP. RIP has a version
number in the packet header, and several empty fields for extending
the packet. The new values used by RIP-2 did not require any changes
to the structure of the packet. The new values are simply placed in
the empty fields that the original protocol reserved for future use.
Properly implemented RIP routers can receive RIP-2 packets and
extract the data that they need from the packet without becoming
confused by the new data.
</p>

<p>Split horizon, poison reverse, triggered updates, and RIP-2 eliminate
most of the problems with the original RIP protocol. But RIP-2 is
still a distance-vector protocol. There are other, newer routing
technologies that are considered superior for large networks. In
particular, <em class="emphasis">link-state</em> routing protocols are
favored because they provide rapid routing convergence and reduce the
possibility of routing loops.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-7-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.4.3. Open Shortest Path First </h3>

<p><em class="emphasis">Open Shortest Path First</em> (OSPF), defined
<a name="INDEX-1468" />
<a name="INDEX-1469" />
<a name="INDEX-1470" />
<a name="INDEX-1471" />by RFC
2328, is a
<em class="emphasis">link-state</em><a name="INDEX-1472" /> protocol. As such, it is very
different from RIP. A router running RIP shares information about the
entire network with its neighbors. Conversely, a router running OSPF
shares information about its neighbors with the entire network. The
"entire network" means, at most, a single autonomous
system. RIP doesn't try to learn about the entire Internet, and
OSPF doesn't try to advertise to the entire Internet.
That's not their job. These are interior routing protocols, so
their job is to construct the routing inside an autonomous system.
OSPF further refines this task by defining a hierarchy of routing
areas within an autonomous system:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Areas</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>An <em class="emphasis">area</em><a name="INDEX-1473" /> is an arbitrary collection of
interconnected networks, hosts, and routers. Areas exchange routing
information with other areas within the autonomous system through
<em class="emphasis">area border routers</em>.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Backbone</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <em class="emphasis">backbone</em><a name="INDEX-1474" /> is a special area that interconnects
all of the other areas within an autonomous system. Every area must
connect to the backbone because the backbone is responsible for
distributing routing information between the areas.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">Stub area</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <em class="emphasis">stub area</em><a name="INDEX-1475" /> has only one area border router,
which means that there is only one route out of the area. In this
case, the area border router does not need to advertise external
routes to the other routers within the stub area. It can simply
advertise itself as the default route.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Only a large autonomous system needs to be subdivided into areas. The
sample network shown in <a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a> is small and
would not need to be divided. We can, however, use it to illustrate
the different areas. We could divide this autonomous system into any
areas we wish. Assume we divide it into three areas: area 1 contains
subnet 3; area 2 contains subnet 1 and subnet 12; and area 3 contains
subnet 25, subnet 36, and the PPP links. Furthermore, we could define
area 1 as a stub area because <em class="emphasis">ora</em> is that
area's only area border router. We also could define area 2 as
the backbone area because it interconnects the other two areas and
all routing information between areas 1 and 3 must be distributed by
area 2. Area 2 contains two area border routers,
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> and <em class="emphasis">ora</em>, and one
interior router, <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>. Area 3 contains
three routers: <em class="emphasis">crab</em>, <em class="emphasis">smith</em>,
and <em class="emphasis">aulds</em>.

<p>Clearly OSPF provides lots of flexibility for subdividing an
autonomous system. But why is it necessary? One problem for a
link-state protocol is the large quantity of data that can be
collected in the <em class="emphasis">link-state database</em> and the
amount of time it can take to calculate the routes from that data. A
look at the protocol shows why this is true.
</p>

<p>Every OSPF router builds a <a name="INDEX-1476" /><em class="emphasis">directed
graph</em><a name="INDEX-1477" /> of the entire network using the
<a name="INDEX-1478" /> <a name="INDEX-1479" />Dijkstra Shortest
Path First (SPF) algorithm. A directed graph is a map of the network
from the perspective of the router; that is, the root of the graph is
the router. The graph is built from the link-state database, which
includes information about every router on the network and all the
neighbors of every router. The link-state database for the autonomous
system in <a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a> contains 5 routers and 10
neighbors: <em class="emphasis">ora</em> has 1 neighbor,
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>; <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> has 2
neighbors, <em class="emphasis">ora</em> and <em class="emphasis">crab</em>;
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> has 3 neighbors,
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em>, <em class="emphasis">aulds</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">smith</em>; <em class="emphasis">aulds</em> has 2
neighbors, <em class="emphasis">crab</em> and <em class="emphasis">smith</em>;
and <em class="emphasis">smith</em> has 2 neighbors,
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> and <em class="emphasis">crab</em>. <a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-3">Figure 7-3</a> shows the graph of this autonomous system from
the perspective of <em class="emphasis">ora</em>.

<p>The Dijkstra algorithm builds the map in this manner:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Install the local system as the root of the map with a cost of 0.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Locate the neighbors of the system just installed and add them to the
map. The cost of reaching the neighbors is calculated as the sum of
the cost of reaching the system just installed plus the cost it
advertises for reaching each neighbor. For example, assume that
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> advertises a cost of 20 for
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> and that the cost of reaching
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> is 15. Then the cost for
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> in <em class="emphasis">ora</em>'s map is
35.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Walk through the map and select the lowest-cost path for each
destination. For example, when <em class="emphasis">aulds</em> is added to
the map, its neighbors include <em class="emphasis">smith</em>. The path
to <em class="emphasis">smith</em> through <em class="emphasis">aulds</em> is
temporarily added to the map. In this third phase of the algorithm,
the cost of reaching <em class="emphasis">smith</em> through
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> is compared to the cost of reaching it
through <em class="emphasis">aulds</em>. The lowest-cost path is selected.
<a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-3">Figure 7-3</a> shows the deleted paths in dotted lines.
Steps 2 and 3 of the algorithm are repeated for every system in the
link-state database.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The information in the <a name="INDEX-1480" />link-state <a name="INDEX-1481" />database is gathered and distributed
in a simple and efficient manner. An OSPF router discovers its
neighbors through the use of Hello packets.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-76">[76]</a> It sends
<a name="INDEX-1482" />
<a name="INDEX-1483" />Hello <a name="INDEX-1484" />packets and listens for Hello packets
from adjacent routers. The Hello packet identifies the local router
and lists the adjacent routers from which it has received packets.
When a router receives a Hello packet that lists it as an adjacent
router, it knows it has found a neighbor. It knows this because it
can hear packets from that neighbor and, because the neighbor lists
it as an adjacent router, the neighbor must be able to hear packets
from it. The newly discovered neighbor is added to the local
system's neighbor list.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-76" /><p>[76]Don't confuse Hello packets with the Hello protocol.
These are OSPF Hello packets.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The OSPF router then advertises all of its neighbors. It does this by
<em class="emphasis">flooding</em> a <a name="INDEX-1485" /> <a name="INDEX-1486" />Link-State
Advertisement (LSA) to <a name="INDEX-1487" />the entire network. The LSA
contains the address of every neighbor and the cost of reaching that
neighbor from the local system. Flooding means that the router sends
the LSA out of every interface and that every router that receives
the LSA sends it out of every interface except the one from which it
was received. To avoid flooding duplicate LSAs, the routers store a
copy of the LSAs they receive and discard duplicates.
</p>

<p><a href="ch07_04.html#tcp3-CHP-7-FIG-2">Figure 7-2</a> provides an example. When OSPF starts on
<em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> it sends a Hello packet on subnet 1
and one on subnet 12. <em class="emphasis">ora</em> and
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> hear the Hello and respond with Hello
packets that list <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> as an adjacent
router. <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> hears their Hello packets and
adds them to its neighbor list. <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> then
creates an LSA that lists <em class="emphasis">ora</em> and
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> as neighbors with appropriate costs
assigned to each. For instance, <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> might
assign a cost of 5 to <em class="emphasis">ora</em> and a cost of 10 to
<em class="emphasis">crab</em>. <em class="emphasis">horseshoe</em> then floods
the LSA on subnet 1 and subnet 12. <em class="emphasis">ora</em> hears the
LSA and floods it on subnet 3. <em class="emphasis">crab</em> receives the
LSA and floods it on both of its PPP links.
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> floods the LSA on the link toward
<em class="emphasis">smith</em>, and <em class="emphasis">smith</em> floods it
on the same link to <em class="emphasis">aulds</em>. When
<em class="emphasis">aulds</em> and <em class="emphasis">smith</em> received
the second copy of the LSA, they discarded it because it duplicated
one that they had already received from <em class="emphasis">crab</em>. In
this manner, every router in the entire network receives every other
router's link-state advertisement.
</p>

<p>OSPF routers track the state of their neighbors by listening for
Hello packets. Hello packets are issued by all routers on a periodic
basis. When a router stops issuing packets, it or the link it is
attached to is assumed to be down. Its neighbors update their LSA and
flood them through the network. The new LSAs are included into the
link-state database on every router on the network, and every router
recalculates its network map based on this new information. Clearly,
limiting the number of routers by limiting the size of the network
reduces the burden of recalculating the map. For many networks, the
entire autonomous system is small enough. For others, dividing the
autonomous system into areas improves efficiency.
</p>

<p>Another feature of OSPF that improves efficiency is
<a name="INDEX-1488" />the <em class="emphasis">designated
router</em><a name="INDEX-1489" />. The designated router is one router on
the network that treats all other routers on the network as its
neighbors, while all other routers treat only the designated router
as their neighbor. This helps reduce the size of the link-state
database and thus improves the speed of the Shortest-Path-First
calculation. Imagine a broadcast network with 5 routers. Five routers
each with 4 neighbors produce a link-state database with 20 entries.
But if one of those routers is the designated router, then that
router has 4 neighbors and all other routers have only 1 neighbor,
for a total of 10 link-state database entries. While there is no need
for a designated router on such a small network, the larger the
network, the more dramatic the gains. For example, a broadcast
network with 25 routers has a link-state database of 50 entries when
a designated router is used, versus a database of 600 entries without
one.
</p>

<p>OSPF provides the router with an end-to-end view of the route between
two systems instead of the limited next-hop view provided by RIP.
Flooding quickly disseminates routing information throughout the
network. Limiting the size of the link-state database through areas
and designated routers speeds the SPF calculation. Taken altogether,
OSPF is an efficient link-state routing protocol.
</p>

<p>OSPF also offers additional features that RIP doesn't. It
provides simple
<a name="INDEX-1490" />
<a name="INDEX-1491" />
<a name="INDEX-1492" />password
authentication to ensure that the update comes from a valid router
using an eight-character, clear-text password. It provides Message
Digest 5 (MD5) crypto-checksum for stronger authentication.
</p>

<p>OSPF also supports <em class="emphasis">equal-cost multi-path
routing</em><a name="INDEX-1493" /> <a name="INDEX-1494" />. This mouthful means that OSPF
routers can maintain more than one path to a single destination.
Given the proper conditions, this feature can be used for load
balancing across multiple network links. However, many systems are
not designed to take advantage of this feature. Refer to your
router's documentation to see if it supports load balancing
across equal-cost OSPF routes.
</p>

<p>With all of these features, OSPF is the preferred TCP/IP interior
routing protocol for dedicated routers.
