<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Protocols, Ports, and Sockets</h2>

<p>Once data is routed through the network and delivered to a specific
host, it must be delivered to the correct user or process. As the
data moves up or down the TCP/IP layers, a mechanism is needed to
deliver it to the correct protocols in each layer. The system must be
able to combine data from many applications into a few transport
protocols, and from the transport protocols into the Internet
Protocol. Combining many sources of data into a single data stream is
<a name="INDEX-452" />called
<em class="emphasis">multiplexing</em>.
</p>

<p>Data arriving from the network must be
<em class="emphasis">demultiplexed</em>: divided for delivery to multiple
processes. To accomplish this task, IP uses <em class="emphasis">protocol
numbers</em> <a name="INDEX-453" />to identify transport protocols, and the
transport protocols use <em class="emphasis">port numbers</em>
<a name="INDEX-454" />to identify
applications.
</p>

<p>Some protocol and port numbers are reserved to identify
<em class="emphasis">well-known
services</em><a name="INDEX-455" />. Well-known services are standard
network protocols, such as FTP and Telnet, that are commonly used
throughout the network. The protocol numbers and port numbers are
assigned to well-known services by the <a name="INDEX-456" /><a name="INDEX-457" />Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). Officially a<em class="emphasis">ssigned numbers</em>
are documented at <a href="http://www.iana.org/">http://www.iana.org</a><a name="INDEX-458" />. Unix systems
define protocol and port numbers in two simple text files.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-2-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.1. Protocol Numbers</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-459" />The
protocol number is a single byte in the third word of the datagram
<a name="INDEX-460" />
<a name="INDEX-461" />header. The value identifies the
protocol in the layer above IP to which the data should be passed.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-462" /><a name="INDEX-463" />On a Unix system, the protocol
numbers are defined in <em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em>. This file
is a simple table containing the protocol name and the protocol
number associated with that name. The format of the table is a single
entry per line, consisting of the official protocol name, separated
by whitespace from the protocol number. The protocol number is
separated by whitespace from the "alias" for the protocol
name. Comments in the table begin with <tt class="literal">#</tt>. An
<em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em> file is shown below:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">cat /etc/protocols</b>

<p>The listing above is the contents of the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em> file from a Solaris 8
workstation. This list of numbers is by no means complete. If you
refer to the Protocol Numbers section of the IANA web site,
you'll see many more protocol numbers. However, a system needs
to include only the numbers of the protocols that it actually uses.
Even the list shown above is more than this specific workstation
needed; for example, the second half of this table is used only on
systems that run IPv6. Don't worry if your system doesn't
use IPv6 or many of these other protocols. The additional entries do
no harm.
</p>

<p>What exactly does this table mean? When a datagram arrives and its
destination address matches the local IP address, the IP layer knows
that the datagram has to be delivered to one of the transport
protocols above it. To decide which protocol should receive the
datagram, IP looks at the datagram's protocol number. Using
this table, you can see that if the datagram's protocol number
is 6, IP delivers the datagram to TCP; if the protocol number is 17,
IP delivers the datagram to UDP. TCP and UDP are the two transport
layer services we are concerned with, but all of the protocols listed
in the first half of the table use IP datagram delivery service
directly. Some, such as ICMP, EGP, and GGP, have already been
mentioned. Others haven't, but you don't need to be
concerned with the minor protocols in order to configure and manage a
TCP/IP network.

<h3 class="sect2">2.6.2. Port Numbers</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-464" />After IP passes
incoming data to the transport protocol, the transport protocol
passes the data to the correct application process. Application
processes (also called <em class="emphasis">network services</em>) are
<a name="INDEX-465" /> <a name="INDEX-466" /><a name="INDEX-467" />identified by port numbers, which are
16-bit values. The source port number, which identifies the process
that sent the data, and the destination port number, which identifies
the process that will receive the data, are contained in the first
header word of each TCP segment and UDP packet.
</p>

<p>Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for well-known services (like
FTP and Telnet) and are assigned by the IANA. Well-known port numbers
are considered "privileged ports" that should not be
bound to a user process. Ports numbered from 1024 to 49151 are
"registered ports." IANA tries to maintain a registry of
<a name="INDEX-468" />services
that use these ports, but it does not officially assign port numbers
in this range. The port numbers from 49152 to 65535 are the
"private ports." Private port numbers are available for
any use.
</p>

<p>Port numbers are not unique between transport layer protocols; the
numbers are unique only within a specific transport protocol. In
other words, TCP and UDP can and do assign the same port numbers. It
is the combination of protocol and port numbers that uniquely
identifies the specific process to which the data should be
delivered.
</p>

<p>On Unix <a name="INDEX-469" /> <a name="INDEX-470" />systems, port
numbers are defined in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file.
There are many more network applications than there are transport
layer protocols, as the size of the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> table shows. A partial
<em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file from a Solaris 8 workstation
is shown here:

<p>The format of this file is very similar to the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em> file. Each single-line entry
starts with the official name of the service separated by whitespace
from the port number/protocol pairing associated with that service.
The port numbers are paired with transport protocol names because
different transport protocols may use the same port number. An
optional list of aliases for
<a name="INDEX-471" />
<a name="INDEX-472" />the
official service name may be provided after the port number/protocol
pair.
</p>

<p>The <em class="filename">/etc/services</em> file, combined with the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/protocols</em> file, provides all of the
information necessary to deliver data to the correct application. A
datagram arrives at its destination based on the destination address
in the fifth word of the datagram header. Using
<a name="INDEX-473" />
<a name="INDEX-474" />
<a name="INDEX-475" />the protocol number in the third word
of the datagram header, IP delivers the data from the datagram to the
proper transport layer protocol. The first word of the data delivered
to the transport protocol contains the destination port number that
tells the transport protocol to pass the data up to a specific
application. <a href="ch02_06.html#tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-5">Figure 2-5</a> shows this delivery
process.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img height="342" alt="Figure 2-5" src="figs/tcp3_0205.gif" width="420" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-5. Protocol and port numbers</h4>

<p>Despite its size, the <em class="emphasis">/etc/services</em> file does
not contain the port number of every important network service. You
won't find the port number of every <em class="emphasis">Remote Procedure
Call</em> (RPC) service <a name="INDEX-476" />in the
<a name="INDEX-477" /><em class="emphasis">services</em>
file. Sun developed a different technique for reserving ports for RPC
services that doesn't involve getting a well-known port number
assignment from IANA. RPC services generally use registered port
numbers, which do not need to be officially assigned. When an RPC
service starts, it registers its port number with the
<tt class="literal">portmapper</tt>. The
<a name="INDEX-478" /><tt class="literal">portmapper</tt>
is a program that keeps track of the port numbers being used by RPC
services. When a client wants to use an RPC service, it queries the
<tt class="literal">portmapper</tt> running on the server to discover the
port assigned to the service. The client can find
<tt class="literal">portmapper</tt> because it is assigned well-known port
111. <tt class="literal">portmapper</tt> makes it possible to install
widely used services without formally obtaining a well-known port.
</p>

</div>
<a name="tcp3-CHP-2-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.3. Sockets</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-479" />Well-known
ports are standardized port numbers that enable
<a name="INDEX-480" />remote
computers to know which port to connect to for a particular network
<a name="INDEX-481" />service.
This simplifies the connection process because both the sender and
receiver know in advance that data bound for a specific process will
use a specific port. For example, all systems that offer Telnet do so
on port 23. <a name="INDEX-482" />
</p>

<p>Equally important is a second type of port number called a
<a name="INDEX-483" /><em class="emphasis">dynamically allocated
port</em>. As the name implies, dynamically allocated ports are
not pre-assigned; they are assigned to processes when needed. The
system ensures that it does not assign the same port number to two
processes, and that the numbers assigned are above the range of
well-known port numbers, i.e., above 1024.
</p>

<p>Dynamically allocated ports provide the flexibility needed to support
multiple users. If a telnet user is assigned port number 23 for both
the source and destination ports, what port numbers are assigned to
the second concurrent telnet user? To uniquely identify every
connection, the source port is assigned a dynamically allocated port
number, and the well-known port number is used for the destination
port.
</p>

<p>In the telnet example, the first user is given a random source port
number and a destination port number of 23 (telnet). The second user
is given a different random source port number and the same
destination port. It is the <em class="emphasis">pair</em> of port
numbers, source and destination, that uniquely identifies each
network connection. The destination host knows the source port
because it is provided in both the TCP segment header and the UDP
packet header. Both hosts know the destination port because it is a
well-known port.
</p>

<p><a href="ch02_06.html#tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-6">Figure 2-6</a> shows the exchange of port numbers
during the TCP handshake. The
<a name="INDEX-484" />source host randomly generates a source
port, in this example 3044. It sends out a segment with a source port
of 3044 and a destination port of 23. The destination host receives
the segment and responds back using 23 as its source port and 3044 as
its destination port.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-2-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="196" alt="Figure 2-6" src="figs/tcp3_0206.gif" width="366" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-6. Passing port numbers</h4>

<p>The combination of an IP address and a port number is called a
<em class="emphasis">socket</em>. A socket uniquely identifies a single
network process within the entire Internet. Sometimes the terms
"socket" and "port number" are used
interchangeably. In fact, well-known services are frequently referred
to as "well-known sockets." In the context of this
discussion, a "socket" is the combination of an IP
address and a port number. A pair of sockets, one socket for the
receiving host and one for the sending host, define the connection
for connection-oriented protocols such as TCP.
</p>

<p>Let's build on the example of dynamically assigned ports and
well-known ports. Assume a user on host 172.16.12.2 uses Telnet to
connect to host 192.168.16.2. Host 172.16.12.2 is the source host.
The user is dynamically assigned a unique port number, 3382. The
connection is made to the telnet service on the remote host, which
is, according to the standard, assigned well-known port 23. The
socket for the source side of the connection is 172.16.12.2.3382 (IP
address 172.16.12.2 plus port number 3382). For the destination side
of the connection, the socket is 192.168.16.2.23 (address
192.168.16.2 plus port 23). The port of the destination socket is
known by both systems because it is a well-known port. The port of
the source socket is known by both systems because the source host
informed the destination host of the source socket when the
connection request was made. The socket pair is therefore known by
both the source and destination computers. The combination of the two
sockets uniquely identifies this connection; no other connection in
the Internet has this <a name="INDEX-485" />socket pair.
