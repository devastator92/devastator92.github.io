<h2 class="sect1">13.2. Diagnostic Tools </h2>

<p>Because most
<a name="INDEX-2859" />problems
have simple causes, developing a clear idea of the problem often
provides the solution. Unfortunately, this is not always true, so in
this section we begin to discuss the tools that can help you attack
the most intractable problems. Many diagnostic tools are available,
ranging from commercial systems with specialized hardware and
software that may cost thousands of dollars, to free software that is
available from the Internet. Many software tools are provided with
your Unix system. You should also keep some hardware tools handy.
</p>

<p>To maintain the network's equipment and wiring, you need some
simple <a name="INDEX-2860" /> <a name="INDEX-2861" />
<a name="INDEX-2862" />hand tools. A pair of needle-nose pliers
and a few screwdrivers may be sufficient, but you may also need
specialized tools. For example, attaching RJ45 connectors to
unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable requires special crimping tools.
It is usually easiest to buy a ready-made network maintenance toolkit
from your cable vendor.
</p>

<p>A full-featured cable tester is also useful. Modern
<a name="INDEX-2863" />cable testers
are small hand-held units with a keypad and LCD display that test
both thinnet and UTP cable. Tests are selected from the keyboard and
results are displayed on the LCD screen. It is not necessary to
interpret the results because the unit does that for you and displays
the error condition in a simple text message. For example, a cable
test might produce the message "Short at 74 feet." This
tells you that the cable is shorted 74 feet away from the tester.
What could be simpler? The proper test tools make it easier to
locate, and therefore fix, cable problems.
</p>

<p>A <a name="INDEX-2864" />laptop computer can be a most useful piece
of test equipment when properly configured. Install TCP/IP software
on the laptop. Take it to the location where the user reports a
network problem. Disconnect the Ethernet cable from the back of the
user's system and attach it to the laptop. Configure the laptop
with an appropriate address for the user's subnet and reboot
it. Then <tt class="literal">ping</tt> various systems on the network and
attach to one of the user's servers. If everything works, the
fault is probably in the user's computer. Users trust this test
because it demonstrates something they do every day. They have more
confidence in the laptop than in an unidentifiable piece of test
equipment displaying the message "No faults found." If
the test fails, the fault is probably in the network equipment or
wiring. That's the time to bring out the cable tester.
</p>

<p>Another advantage of using a laptop as a piece of test equipment is
its inherent versatility. It runs a wide variety of test, diagnostic,
and management software. Install Unix on the laptop and run the
software discussed in the rest of this chapter from your desktop or
your laptop.
</p>

<p>This book emphasizes free or "built-in" software
diagnostic tools that run on Unix systems. The software tools used in
this chapter, and many more, are described in <a name="INDEX-2865" />RFC 1470, <em class="emphasis">FYI on a Network
anagement Tool Catalog: Tools for Monitoring and Debugging TCP/IP
Internets and Interconnected Devices</em>. A catchy title, and
a useful RFC! The RFC is somewhat dated, but it does point out some
very useful tools. The tools listed in that catalog and discussed in
this book are:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2866" /><dt><i>ifconfig</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides information about the basic configuration of the interface.
It is useful for detecting bad IP addresses, incorrect subnet masks,
and improper broadcast addresses. <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring the Interface "</a> covers
<tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt> in detail. This tool is provided with the
Unix operating system.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2867" /><dt><i>arp</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides information about Ethernet/IP address translation. It can be
used to detect systems on the local network that are configured with
the wrong IP address. <tt class="literal">arp</tt> is covered in this
chapter and is used in an example in <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>.
<tt class="literal">arp</tt> is delivered as part of Unix.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2868" /><dt><i>netstat</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides a variety of information. It is commonly used to display
detailed statistics about each network interface, the network
sockets, and the network routing table. <tt class="literal">netstat</tt> is
used repeatedly in this book, most extensively in Chapters <a href="ch02_01.html">Chapter 2, "Delivering the Data"</a>, <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6, "Configuring the Interface "</a>, and <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Configuring Routing "</a>. <tt class="literal">netstat</tt> is delivered as
part of Unix.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2869" /><dt><i>ping</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates whether a remote host can be reached.
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> also displays statistics about packet loss
and delivery time. <tt class="literal">ping</tt> is discussed in <a href="ch01_01.html">Chapter 1, "
Overview of TCP/IP"</a> and used in <a href="ch07_01.html">Chapter 7, "Configuring Routing "</a>.
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> also comes as part of Unix.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2870" /><dt><i>nslookup</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides information about the DNS name service.
<tt class="literal">nslookup</tt> is covered in detail in <a href="ch08_01.html">Chapter 8, "Configuring DNS"</a>. It comes as part of the BIND software
package.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>dig</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Also provides information about name service and is similar to
<tt class="literal">nslookup</tt>.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2871" /><dt><i> traceroute</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints information about each routing hop that packets take going
from your system to a remote system.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2872" /><dt><i>snoop</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Analyzes the individual packets exchanged between hosts on a network.
<tt class="literal">snoop</tt> is a TCP/IP protocol analyzer included with
Solaris 8 systems. It examines the contents of packets, including
their headers, and is most useful for analyzing protocol problems.
<tt class="literal">tcpdump</tt> is a tool similar to
<tt class="literal">snoop</tt> that is provided with Linux systems.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>This chapter discusses each of these tools, even those covered
earlier in the text. We start with <tt class="literal">ping</tt>, which is
used in more troubleshooting situations than any other diagnostic
tool.
