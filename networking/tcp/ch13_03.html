<h2 class="sect1">13.3. Testing Basic Connectivity </h2>

<p>The <tt class="literal">ping</tt> command <a name="INDEX-2873" />
<a name="INDEX-2874" />
<a name="INDEX-2875" />tests whether a remote host
can be reached from your computer. This simple function is extremely
useful for testing the network connection, independent of the
application in which the original problem was detected.
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> allows you to determine whether further
testing should be directed toward the network connection (the lower
layers) or the application (the upper layers). If
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> shows that packets can travel to the remote
system and back, the user's problem is probably in the upper
layers. If packets can't make the round trip, lower protocol
layers are probably at fault.
</p>

<p>Frequently a user reports a network problem by stating that he
can't <tt class="literal">telnet</tt> (or <tt class="literal">ftp</tt>, or
send email, or whatever) to some remote host. He then immediately
qualifies this statement with the announcement that it worked before.
In cases like this, where the ability to connect to the remote host
is in question, <tt class="literal">ping</tt> is a very useful tool.
</p>

<p>Using the hostname provided by the user, <tt class="literal">ping</tt> the
remote host. If your <tt class="literal">ping</tt> is successful, have the
user <tt class="literal">ping</tt> the host. If the user's
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> is also successful, concentrate your further
analysis on the specific application that the user is having trouble
with. Perhaps the user is attempting to <tt class="literal">telnet</tt> to
a host that provides only anonymous <tt class="literal">ftp</tt>. Perhaps
the host was down when the user tried his application. Have the user
try it again, while you watch or listen to every detail of what he is
doing. If he is doing everything right and the application still
fails, detailed analysis of the application with
<tt class="literal">snoop</tt> and coordination with the remote system
administrator may be needed.
</p>

<p>If your <tt class="literal">ping</tt> is successful and the user's
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> fails, concentrate testing on the
user's system configuration, and on those things that are
different about the user's path to the remote host when
compared to your path to the remote host.
</p>

<p>If your <tt class="literal">ping</tt> fails, or the user's
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> fails, pay close attention to any error
messages. The error messages displayed by <tt class="literal">ping</tt> are
helpful guides for planning further testing. The details of the
messages may vary from implementation to implementation, but there
are only a few basic types of errors:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="INDEX-2876" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Unknown host</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The remote host's name cannot be resolved by name service into
an IP address. The name servers could be at fault (either your local
server or the remote system's server), the name could be
incorrect, or something could be wrong with the network between your
system and the remote server. If you know the remote host's IP
address, try to <tt class="literal">ping</tt> that. If you can reach the
host using its IP address, the problem is with name service. Use
<tt class="literal">nslookup</tt> or <tt class="literal">dig</tt> to test the
local and remote servers, and to check the accuracy of the hostname
the user gave you.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2877" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">Network unreachable</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The local system does not have a route to the remote system. If the
numeric IP address was used on the <tt class="literal">ping</tt> command
line, re-enter the <tt class="literal">ping</tt> command using the
hostname. This eliminates the possibility that the IP address was
entered incorrectly, or that you were given the wrong address. If a
routing protocol is being used, make sure it is running and check the
routing table with <tt class="literal">netstat</tt>. If a static default
route is being used, reinstall it. If everything seems fine on the
host, check its default gateway for routing problems.
</p>
</dd>


<a name="INDEX-2878" /><dt><i><em class="emphasis">No answer</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The remote system did not respond. Most network utilities have some
version of this message. Some <tt class="literal">ping</tt> implementations
print the message "100% packet loss."
<tt class="literal">telnet</tt> prints the message "Connection timed
out" and <tt class="literal">sendmail</tt> returns the error
"cannot connect." All of these errors mean the same
thing. The local system has a route to the remote system, but it
receives no response from the remote system to any of the packets it
sends.
</p>

<p>There are many possible causes of this problem. The remote host may
be down. Either the local or the remote host may be configured
incorrectly. A gateway or circuit between the local host and the
remote host may be down. The remote host may have routing problems.
Only additional testing can isolate the cause of the problem.
Carefully check the local configuration using
<tt class="literal">netstat</tt> and <tt class="literal">ifconfig</tt>. Check the
route to the remote system with <tt class="literal">traceroute</tt>.
Contact the administrator of the remote system and report the
problem.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>All of the tools mentioned here will be discussed later in this
chapter. However, before leaving <tt class="literal">ping</tt>, let's
look more closely at the command and the statistics it displays.
</p>

<a name="tcp3-CHP-13-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.3.1. The ping Command </h3>

<p>The basic <a name="INDEX-2879" />
<a name="INDEX-2880" />
<a name="INDEX-2881" />format of the
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> command on a Solaris system is:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-143">[143]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-143" /><p>[143]Check your system's documentation.
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> varies slightly from system to system. On
Linux, the format shown above would be: <tt class="literal">ping</tt>
<tt class="literal">[-c</tt> <em class="replaceable">count</em><tt class="literal">]
[-s</tt>
<em class="replaceable">packetsize</em><tt class="literal">]</tt>
<em class="replaceable">host</em>.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ping <em class="replaceable">host</em> [<em class="replaceable">packetsize</em>] [<em class="replaceable">count</em>]</pre></blockquote>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="replaceable">host</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The hostname or IP address of the remote host being tested. Use the
hostname or address provided by the user in the trouble report.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="replaceable">packetsize</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the size in bytes of the test packets. This field is required
only if the <em class="replaceable">count</em> field is going to be
used. Use the default <em class="replaceable">packetsize</em> of 56
bytes.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="replaceable">count</em></i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of packets to be sent in the test. Use the
<em class="replaceable">count</em> field, and set the value low.
Otherwise, the <tt class="literal">ping</tt> command may continue to send
test packets until you interrupt it, usually by pressing Ctrl-C (^C).
Sending excessive numbers of test packets is not a good use of
network bandwidth and system resources. Usually five packets are
sufficient for a test.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>To check that <em class="emphasis">ns.uu.net</em> can be reached from
<em class="emphasis">crab</em>, we send five 56-byte packets with the
following command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">ping -s ns.uu.net 56 5</b> 
PING ns.uu.net: 56 data bytes 
64 bytes from ns.uu.net (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=0. time=32.8 ms 
64 bytes from ns.uu.net (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=1. time=15.3 ms 
64 bytes from ns.uu.net (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=2. time=13.1 ms 
64 bytes from ns.uu.net (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=3. time=32.4 ms 
64 bytes from ns.uu.net (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=4. time=28.1 ms 
 
----ns.uu.net PING Statistics---- 
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 13.1/24.3/32.8</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">-s</tt> option is included because
<em class="emphasis">crab</em> is a
<a name="INDEX-2882" />Solaris workstation, and we want
packet-by-packet statistics. Without the <tt class="literal">-s</tt>
option, Sun's <tt class="literal">ping</tt> command prints only a
summary line saying "ns.uu.net is alive." Other
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> implementations do not require the
<tt class="literal">-s</tt> option; they display the statistics by default,
as the Linux example below shows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <b class="emphasis-bold">ping -c5 ns.uu.net</b>
PING ns.uu.net (137.39.1.3) from 172.16.12.3 : 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from ns.UU.NET (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=0 ttl=244 time=98.283 msec
64 bytes from ns.UU.NET (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=1 ttl=244 time=94.114 msec
64 bytes from ns.UU.NET (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=2 ttl=244 time=66.565 msec
64 bytes from ns.UU.NET (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=3 ttl=244 time=24.301 msec
64 bytes from ns.UU.NET (137.39.1.3): icmp_seq=4 ttl=244 time=37.060 msec

--- ns.uu.net ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round trip min/avg/max/mdev = 24.301/64.064/98.283/29.634 ms</pre></blockquote>

<p>Both tests show a good wide area network link to
<em class="emphasis">ns.uu.net</em> with no packet loss and a fast
response. The round trip between <em class="emphasis">almond</em> and
<em class="emphasis">ns.uu.net</em> took an average of only 24.3
milliseconds. A small packet loss, and a round trip time an order of
magnitude higher, would not be abnormal for a connection made across
a wide area network. The statistics displayed by the
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> command can indicate low-level network
problems. The key statistics are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The sequence in which the packets are arriving, as shown by the ICMP
sequence number (<tt class="literal">icmp_seq</tt>) displayed for each
packet.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>How long it takes a packet to make the round trip, displayed in
milliseconds after the string <tt class="literal">time=</tt>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The percentage of packets lost, displayed in a summary line at the
end of the <tt class="literal">ping</tt> output.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If the packet loss is high, the response time is very slow, or
packets are arriving out of order, there could be a network hardware
problem. If you see these conditions when communicating over great
distances on a wide area network, there is nothing to worry about.
TCP/IP was designed to deal with unreliable networks, and some wide
area networks suffer a lot of packet loss. But if these problems are
seen on a local area network, they indicate trouble.
</p>

<p>On a local network cable segment, the round trip time should be near
0, there should be little or no packet loss, and the packets should
arrive in order. If these things are not true, there is a problem
with the network hardware. On an Ethernet, the problem could be
improper cable termination, a bad cable segment, or a bad piece of
"active" hardware, such as a hub, switch, or transceiver.
Check the cable with a cable tester as described earlier. Good hubs
and switches often have built-in diagnostic software that can be
checked. Cheap hubs and transceivers may require the "brute
force" method of disconnecting individual pieces of hardware
until the problem goes away.
</p>

<p>The results of a simple <tt class="literal">ping</tt> test, even if the
<tt class="literal">ping</tt> is successful, can help you direct further
testing toward the most likely causes of the problem. But other
diagnostic tools are needed to examine the problem more closely and
find the underlying cause.
